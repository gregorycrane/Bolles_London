                   <head>PREFACE</head>


  <p>THIS History of England was planned and has been written with an especial view to its use in Schools, and among younger students who read the subject.
It contains, first, a connected relation of the main facts of the political and constitutional history in due chronological order; secondly, a sketch as thorough as space would allow, of the course and progress of the language, literature, and social life of the English people, in a series of chapters at the end of the various periods into which the history naturally falls. While I have not shrunk from noticing institutions and events for the full understanding of which the beginner may require the teacher's oral help; and while I have thought it well to give the most dramatic and pathetic incidents of the story wherever I could in the very words of a contemporary authority, I have nevertheless tried to write in a simple, straightforward style, and have added a brief glossary of those few unusual or technical words I have been unable to avoid, or explain in the text.
Maps, Plans, Tables, and Pedigrees have been supplied in sufficient detail to enable the reader to get a true idea of the relative positions of the persons or places named in the text.</p>
  <p>To the counsels of friends at present engaged in active


<pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/>
 school work I have everywhere tried to pay attention; but no matter how carefully prepared a text-book may be, the results to be gained from its use must chiefly depend upon the teacher, and those who have taught history themselves will know that it is an exceptionally hard subject to deal with satisfactorily.</p>
  <p>It is neither customary nor needful to give a list of the books used in preparing such a work as this. It will be enough, I hope, for me to say that I have written it from the main original documents upon which our knowledge of English history must depend, though I have not, of course, omitted to consult modern writers.
Those of my friends to whom I owe special gratitude for help or advice should know that I feel it, though their names are not recorded here.</p>
  <p>The Index will give the main references, and the headings affixed to each section will be found to yield a running epitome of the contents of the book.
  This first part, for which I alone am responsible, ends with the death of <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName>: this I regard as essentially a deep dividing line in the history of this country.
The second and third parts, on the same plan and scale, are the work of <persName key="Tout,T.F.">Mr. Tout</persName>, Professor of Modern History at Owens College, Victoria University.  Although each part is complete in itself, the three together form a complete History of England.</p>
  <p>The present edition has been revised throughout.</p>

 <head>CHAPTER I: Britain and the Britons.</head>

               

  <p>1. The first people we know to have lived in our island were but a few families of wandering savages of the lowest type and intelligence, who picked up a wretched livelihood by the banks of our southern and eastern rivers, where their remains and the rude flint chips which served them for tools and weapons are sometimes found. In their day the climate was far colder than it is now; there were great glaciers stretching over the higher valleys, where the musk ox and the Arctic fox found their food. In the wild wooded plains and moors below lived herds of deer, the wild bull, the giant elk, the wild horse, and their enemies the cave-lion, the cave-bear, and the hyena, while the swamps and lowlands by the river mouths were haunted by many kinds of river-horse, rhinoceros, and elephant.</p>
<p><note place="foot" n="1">People of <placeName key="Albion">Albion</placeName> and Erin.</note>
  But when our history really begins, the climate had become warmer, the glaciers had melted away, and the little savages and the huge beasts they had hunted or fled from had alike died out. In their place was a new race of men, wiser, stronger, and more numerous, who had come from the south over the sea, and spread over the plains of <placeName key="Albion">Albion</placeName> and Erin. As yet we know little about these people, though it is certain that many of us now living in England are come of their blood.</p>
  <p>They were short of stature, with long narrow heads, large jaws, and high cheekbones; their hair, worn long and unkempt or knotted above their heads, was dark. Their clothing was of roughly-dressed skins, but they painted their faces and bodies with red ochre and blue woad juice, and decked


<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>
 themselves with beads of stone and shell and jet. Their tools and weapons, axes, knives, and darts, were made of stone, wood, or bone. They made rough clay vessels which would carry water but could not stand the fire. They kept dogs, and lived mostly by hunting (for they never tilled the ground, and for a long time had no cattle) or on the wild fruits and herbs of the forests, or the shellfish on the shore.
They used to make a kind of pemmican of venison and wild berries which could be stored for some time. Some of them were cannibals, although there was still no lack of game, wild cattle, beavers, bears, and many birds and beasts besides those we now have.</p>
  <p>Their dwellings were caves or earth-houses of one room, with a long low passage leading to it through which the family that lived therein could creep in or out. The long egg-shaped barrows so common in many parts of England are the graves of the chiefs of this people, and we find in them the ashes of the dead and ornaments and weapons put there for the use of their spirits, often, too, the remains of the funeral feast. If the great stone monuments such as the
Avenues of Carnac and the Rings at Avebury be the work of this people, they must have had a religion strong enough to bring them together in great numbers to set up such huge works. The Irish stories always talk of them as wizards using charms and poisoned weapons and enchantments.
Among the few relics of their language are the names <placeName key="Albion">Albion</placeName> and Iverio (Erin), which they gave to England and Ireland.</p>
   <note place="foot" n="2">The Britons</note>
   <p>2. About <date value="500 B.C.">500 B.C.</date> the KELTS, an Aryan people coming from the East, who had already conquered great part of Iberia (Spain) and Liguria (France) from the brethren of the people of <placeName key="Albion">Albion</placeName>, sent colonies into our islands, and won them too, driving their enemies into the wild western corners of the land, where many of them were still living when <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> and Tacitus wrote. Of these KELTS, whose speech is still spoken by more than two millions of us
(Welsh, Irish, and Scots), much more may be told. The
Greeks and Romans speak of them as tall and well made, round headed, light haired, and blue eyed, dressed in shirts and hose of linen, and wrapped in cloaks or gowns of light striped plaid-cloth
 (whence the name Briton or clothed borne by the Kelts who conquered <placeName key="Albion">Albion</placeName>), and adorned with gold and silver neck and arm rings. Their weapons and tools were bronze ; they were clever at metal-work, basket-making, and pottery; worked mines for lead and tin, which they sold to Phoenician merchants, and even struck gold money copied from the Greek

<pb id="p.3" n="3"/>
 pieces they got in trade. They kept large herds of cattle and pigs, bred horses for driving, and had fine mastiffs and wolf-hounds for hunting; but they also tilled the ground, ploughing with oxen, and grew grain. They used canoes made of wood and coracles of wicker and leather on the rivers and lakes, but they never loved the sea.</p>
  <p>The BRITONS were divided into many tribes, each with its own king (though sometimes two or three tribes would obey one head-king), the power in each tribe lying in the hands of the gentry and priests, the mass of the people being the clients of the gentry, who lent them the cattle upon which their livelihood rested, and got from them rent and service in return. The gentry's chief business was war, and they were brave soldiers. <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> notices their skill in managing their war-chariots, turning and wheeling them quickly and leaping in or out at a given signal, or running along the shafts to hurl their spears, while the swift little horses were going full speed over broken ground.</p>
  <p>Their arms were broadswords, dirks, spears, and axes; the northern tribes used long swords and a short dart with a rattling ball at the butt-end, which they clashed in the charge.
The chiefs wore helmets, and nearly every man had a shield of skin and wicker and a horn which he blew up for the battle; so that with the roaring of the horns, the clashing of the arms, the creaking of the chariots, and the war-cries of the warriors the onslaught of a Keltic tribe was very terrible even to trained soldiers.</p>
  <p>Of the learned class, who enjoyed high honours, had a share of all spoil, and were sacred even in battle, were the
Druids, prophets and priests, who worshipped in hallowed groves, slaying men and beasts on their altars for omens, or burning them in huge wicker images as offerings to their gods. There were also the <hi rend="italics">poets</hi>, who kept the records and traditions and pedigrees of the tribes, and acted as ambassadors and heralds, besides singing for the amusement of the chiefs and people at banquets and merry-makings. There were judges too, who knew the old laws and customs and
<quote>" spoke them"</quote> to the people. These men took great trouble in training themselves and learning the verses which enshrined all the wisdom of their forefathers; but they had no books, though <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> tells us they used the Greek alphabet for writing short messages and the like.</p>
  <p>All the Kelts believed in the deathlessness and transmigration of the soul, and trusted in many gods, such as Brigantia and her two sisters, goddesses of poetry, healing, and metal-work; Manannan, the son of the sea; Ana, mother of

<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>

 the gods; Ogmios, god of eloquence; Neit, lord of battle, and
Nemon, his wife (gods of the people of <placeName key="Albion">Albion</placeName>); Maponos, the young hunter-god; Camulos, the god of the under-world, father of all men; the three Great Queens that warn the warrior of his fate appearing in the form of birds, and many others of lesser power that haunted woods and springs and lakes and rocks. The dead were buried in a splendid and costly way with great lamentation and feasting, the ashes of the chiefs being put into urns and set in stone-slabbed chambers under large round barrows.</p>
  <p>The Britons did not live in towns, but in scattered villages of neat wattled cots thatched with straw or bracken; the chiefs' houses were of like kind but larger, and fenced about with a palisaded earthen wall. Each tribe had a dun (stronghold) stockaded, walled, and entrenched, within which people and cattle could take shelter in war-time. London, Sinodun, and
Dumbarton were fortresses of this kind. Between these duns ran rough roads along the downs and hill-tops, and at convenient places where these roads crossed, or on open plains or hill-sides beside the graves of great chiefs, fairs were held at certain seasons of the year, where trade between different tribes was carried on, and no doubt, as in Ireland later, much merry-making (games, horse-racing, singing of poetry, and so on) took place.</p>
  <p>In character the Britons were, in the main, like their descendants, brave to recklessness, open-handed, polite, fond of show and talk and novelty, dearly loving their country, and faithful to their family; but too quarrelsome, fickle, and restless under control to make steady progress, to combine long in any undertaking, or to withstand a persevering foe.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="CHAPTER II: The Romans in Britain." id="c2">

                      <head>CHAPTER II: The Romans in Britain.55 B.C.</head>
                
  <p>1. Caius Julius <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> the Roman had already conquered
<note place="foot" n="1">Julius <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName>'s forays in Britain.</note> <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName> and subdued all the Keltic tribes there, when late in <date value="55">55</date> B.C. he determined to go to
Britain, wishing to know what kind of land it was and hoping to stop the Britons from sending help (as they had been doing) to their kinsfolk across the Channel. So, as he tells us, he set sail with two legions, reached the coast near
<placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, and began to disembark his troops in the face of the
British chariots and horsemen gathered on the beach to resist him. The water being too shallow for his big galleys to lie close inshore, the Romans had to wade through the

<pb id="p.5" n="5"/>

 surf to the beach, under a shower of darts and stones which they could neither ward off nor return. Even the veterans were disheartened for a while, though <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> sent light boats filled with slingers and archers into the shallows where they could gall the Britons and cover their comrades' landing; but suddenly the standard-bearer of the famous 10th legion sprang into the water calling out, <q type="spoken">"Come on, men, if ye do not mean to leave your eagle to the enemy, for I shall go forward and do my duty to my country and my general."</q>
The 10th rushed after him to save the holy standard, made good their landing, and, the other troops following, drove the Britons inland. But <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> dared not pursue them far from the coast, finding them no mean foes, and dreading the winter storms, so, getting a promise of peace from two tribes, he went back to <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName> empty-handed. However, next year he came again with a larger force, four legions and several squadrons of cavalry, landed, and hearing that Cassivellamnos, head-king of the tribes north of the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>, was gathering the Britons against him, left a few men to guard his fleet and struck inland to meet him. First crossing the
<placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> in the face of the enemy he took London, and even carried Verulam, the British king's stronghold.  But the country was wild and unknown, the Britons hung round the army and harassed his march, and the four kings of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> were besetting his small camp on the coast. <persName key="Caesar,Julius">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> therefore gladly received Cassivellamnos' proposals for peace, took hostages from several tribes, and retired to <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName>;</p>
  <p>2. Twice more, by <persName key="Augustus">Augustus</persName> and <persName key="last,first">Caligula</persName>, was Britain threatened, but not till <persName key="Claudius">Claudius</persName>' days was the  <note place="foot" n="2"><persName key="Claudius">Claudius</persName> conquers Britain.</note> threat carried out, when, in <date value="43">A.D. 43</date>, his generals
Aulus Plautius and Ostorius Scapula landed and won the south of the land bit by bit. The eastern Camulodun, capital of the Icenian prince, <soCalled>"the radiant Cymbeline"</soCalled> (Cunobelinos), was stormed under the emperor's eyes. In the north the Brigantes were forced into submission, while in the west the Silures were crushed by the defeat and capture of their king, Caratocos.  The story of this brave chief's interview with <persName key="Claudius">Claudius</persName> at Rome, where his bold bearing won him the favour of the empress and the pardon of the emperor at her request, is well known.</p>
  <p>The usual steps were taken to hold the new province, military stations were set near the duns of the different tribes, colonies of veteran soldiers were planted here and there at important points, well-made roads were drawn from camp to camp throughout the whole land, and a number of Roman



<pb id="p.6" n="6"/> <note type="header"  place="head">A.D. <date value="61">61</date></note>
 officers appointed to govern it: those tribes who submitted peacefully being allowed to keep their own laws and chiefs on payment of tribute to the emperor. But the harshness, greediness, and money-lending of the Roman officers led to more than one outbreak, and at last to a terrible revolt.</p>
  <p>3. The king of the Eceni, Prasutagos, a friend of the Romans and a rich man, made the emperor
<note place="foot" n="3"><persName key="Boudicca">Boudicca</persName>'s rising, <date value="61">A.D. 61</date>.</note> by his will coheir with his own two daughters to all that he had, hoping so to gain safety for his people and family when he was gone.  But as soon as he was dead, under colour of looking after the emperor's rights, the
Roman officers fell to plundering his people and pillaging his house, nay, they even sold his kinsmen into slavery, brutally ill-treated his daughters, and scourged his widow,
<persName key="Boudicca">Boudicca</persName>. Then the Eceni rose and took a bitter revenge.
They broke into Camulodun, where the Romans took refuge in a temple, defending it two or three days in their despair; but in vain, for it was stormed, the town fired, and every living thing within it put to death. They then marched to
Verulam and London, which in like manner they utterly destroyed. The 9th legion venturing to attack them was completely cut to pieces in the open field, and so great was the panic that most of the Romans in the south of Britain and the wicked governor himself fled to <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName>. But the general, <persName key="Paullinus,Suetonius">Suetonius Paullinus</persName>, who was with the 14th legion away in the west, where he had just won the Druids' sacred island, <placeName key="Mona">Mona</placeName>, after a fierce struggle, saved the province.
Hurrying back at the news of the rising he met <persName key="Boudicca">Boudicca</persName> and her huge host at Ambresbury Banks.</p>
  <p>The queen, a tall grim-looking woman with fierce blue eyes and long yellow hair that fell from under her helmet over her golden collar and plaid mantle, went through the
British army spear in hand in a war-chariot with her two daughters, praying her countrymen with brave words to fight boldly and win revenge for her and freedom for themselves.
But <persName key="Paullinus,Suetonius">Paullinus</persName>' attack was so well-timed and strongly followed up that the less disciplined Britons were forced back upon the wall of waggons which formed their camp, and there hemmed in and slain to a man, for the Romans were furious at the cruelties of the <soCalled>"mutiny"</soCalled> as they called it. <persName key="Boudicca">Boudicca</persName> <soCalled>"triumphed over death,"</soCalled> taking poison when she saw the day was lost rather than fall alive into her foemen's hands. So the Rising ended, but when <persName key="Nero">Nero</persName> heard the causes of it, he recalled the bad governor and sent out a more righteous man.</p>

<pb id="p.7" n="7"/>

<note type="header"  place="head"><dateRange from="69" to="368">69-368</dateRange>.]</note>

  <p>4. The north of Britain was as yet unsubdued, and the wild
Caledonians used to make forays southwards  <note place="foot" n="4"><persName key="Agricola,Julius">Agricola</persName> and his way with the Britons.</note> and harry the province, till <persName key="Agricola,Julius">Julius Agricola</persName>, Domitian's general, defeated their king, Calgacos, in a pitched battle, and built a chain of forts from the Forth to the Clyde as a barrier against them. He also explored the north coast with his fleet, which he sent round the whole island, and even planned the invasion of Ireland. But the work this good and wise man had most at heart was the civilization of the Britons. He tried to persuade the gentlemen to take up Roman ways, and let their sons be taught
Roman knowledge; and so much had he gained the goodwill of the provincials by his uprightness that when the seven years of his governorship were over, a great part of the land was fast becoming Romanized, and the danger was henceforth from without not from within.</p>
  <p>5. The northern part of the province was still harassed by the wild tribes, and <persName key="Hadrian">Hadrian</persName>, A.D. <date value ="121">121</date>, was         <note place="foot" n="5">The barbarians, Picts, Scots, and Saxons.</note> obliged to give up the Clyde valley and try to check the Caledonians by a huge dyke stretching from the Tyne to the Solway. Antonine, however, gained back <persName key="Hadrian">Hadrian</persName>'s losses and strengthened <persName key="Agricola,Julius">Agricola</persName>'s line by a wall, while Severus, in <date value ="209">209</date>, carried the war into
<placeName key="Caledonia">Caledonia</placeName> and reached the great North Bay by hard fighting, in which thousands of Roman soldiers fell either by disease brought on by hardships and overwork or by the darts of the natives. At last he too was obliged to fall back on <persName key="Hadrian">Hadrian</persName>'s dyke, in front of which he built a stone wall,
Eboracum (<placeName key="York">York</placeName>) being now the headquarters of the Victorious 6th legion. Beside the PICTS [painted folk] (as the
Caledonians were now called), the SCOTS [tattooed men], from north Ireland, laid waste the west coasts of Britain in spite of the Gallant and Conquering 20th legion stationed at
Deva (Chester), while the east and south were harried by a still more dreaded foe, the SAXONS of the North Sea shores.
Against them a line of nine strong forts was built, covering the land from the Wash to Lymne, and garrisoned by the 2nd legion, the August, and other picked troops, the harbours of
London and <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> being watched by a fleet of war-galleys.</p>
  <p>But the barbarians' attacks on Britain were but an example of what was going on all along the Roman frontiers, and soon, Italy itself being threatened, the outlying provinces were in still greater jeopardy.  However, the island was held for many years more. Under <persName key="Constantine">Constantine</persName>, the first

But the division of the empire, the troubles in <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName>, and the quarrels and revolts of the Roman governors in the island (several of whom, like Carausius, proclaimed themselves emperors and strove by the help of their armies and fleets to win supreme power) all joined, along with the never-ceasing attacks of the Irish and Picts, in bringing the
Roman rule in Britain to an end. Legion after legion left the province, and though succours were sent back now and again, when they could be spared, to help the weakened garrison, the evacuation went steadily on (the Roman colonists burying their treasures in vain hopes of return and following the soldiers) till about <date value ="367">367</date> years after the landing of Aulus Plautius it was complete.</p>
  <p>6. To the Romans we owe much. <note place="foot" n="1">Results of the Roman rule in Britain.</note>
Great changes have taken place during their rule. So much wild forest-land had been cleared and tilled that
Britain was called the Granary of the North.
Great marshes had been drained (the first dikes in the Fens are Roman work), river-beds deepened and harbours dredged, gardens and vineyards had been laid out in Italian fashion
(in many places the terraces along the hillsides may still be traced), stocked with many kinds of useful trees, shrubs, and plants brought from abroad, and sheep-farming had begun.
  Iron (wrought in the Midlands, in the south, and in Dean
Forest) had replaced bronze for tools and weapons, lead and tin mines and saltworks were carefully carried on, beautiful pottery was made on the banks of the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> and
Medway, and fine glass by the Channel shores. Handsome villas furnished with all the comforts of Roman life, strong fortresses, walled and tower-flanked, fine brick-built towns, with theatres, temples, baths, and law courts, stood on the sites of the rude halls and duns of Keltic Britain. More than thirty cities, besides <placeName key="York">York</placeName> the capital, and many regular stations, are known to have existed, all knit together by paved roads running straight from point to point, crossing rivers and fens by bridge or causeway, gently graded over hills, and furnished with <hi rend="italics">cold harbours</hi> [walled resting-places] at convenient stages. Wherever the words -<hi rend="italics">caster</hi> (N.), -<hi rend="italics">cester</hi>

Roman merchant towns and harbours. Hence ships built in Britain carried grain, pearls, metals, slaves,horses, and hounds abroad, bringing back silk and gold and precious stones and all the luxuries of Rome. Roman influence is further shown by the use of Latin among the upper classes, and the number of words, belonging to war, government, religion, etc., which have found their way into Welsh, though the Latin tongue never ousted the Keltic in West Britain (as it did in the most part of <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName> and Spain) in spite of the long occupation by some 50,000 Roman soldiers and officials, besides the many foreigners in the towns.</p>
  <p>But besides fixing the sites of our great cities and opening up the country by roads, the Romans gave us our religion.
In the first century Christianity reached Britain and began to spread among the Romanized Britons.  Of this early
British Church and its history little is known save the names of a few bishops of London, C&#x00E6;rleon, and <placeName key="York">York</placeName>; the sites of a score of churches (<placeName key="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</placeName>, <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, <placeName key="S. Martin's">S. Martin's</placeName> Canterbury, etc.); the origin of a new heresy, the Pelagian, in the fifth century; and a few beautiful legends, such as those of
<quote>"good Lucius that first received the sacred pledge of Christ's
Evangely;"</quote> of S. Alban, the first martyr of Britain, slain on the hill by Verulam, where now his noble minster stands; of
S. Germanus, prophet of the wrath to come. But it is certain that the Romans left the province Christian, with a regular hierarchy, several monasteries, and a Latin translation of the Bible.  From this Church is descended the Welsh
Church, and, by the labours of S. Ninian and SS. Palladius and Patrick, Welsh missionaries to the heathen Ivernians and Kelts in <placeName key="Caledonia">Caledonia</placeName> and Hibernia, the Churches of Scotland and Ireland. How.these converts in their turn spread the Christian faith among us English will be told later on.
Meanwhile the heavy debt we owe the British Church should make us pass lightly over the later days of its sway in Roman
Britain, as they are shown to us in the stern forebodings of
Gildas the monk, who denounces the wickedness of the people,- the corruption of the priesthood, and the guilt of the rulers, whose crimes cast contempt upon the faith they professed so loudly but were so loath to follow.</p>

<note type="header"  place="head"><dateRange from="400" to="613">400-613</dateRange>.</note>
  <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1">The English Conquest.</note>For more than a century the SAXONS and other Teuton
  tribes had ravaged Roman Britain, and latterly
  made small settlements upon the south and
  east coasts, but now that the Romans were gone, seeing the
  <quote>"nothingness of the Britons and the goodness of the land,"</quote>
  they came in large bodies to settle, bringing their wives and
  children and cattle with them in their keels, and took up
  their abode here for ever, slaying the chiefs and warriors of
  the Welsh (as they called the Britons), or driving them
  before them into the west.</p>
  <p>This conquest took two hundred years, and we can see that it came about bit by bit in- two stages as it were.
  In the first (<dateRange from="400" to="520">400-520</dateRange>) the invaders won the greater part of the east and south coasts of Britain, and set up small kingdoms along them.</p>
  <p>The JUTES in <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, <placeName key="Wight">Wight</placeName>, and the Hants coast.
  The SAXONS in <placeName key="Sussex">Sussex</placeName>, <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>, Essex, and Middlesex.
  The ENGLISH (from whom the whole land was called England) in East England, Middle England, Lindesey, Deira, and
Bernicia (the Welsh names for the country round <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and
Bamborough, meaning the Water-land and the Brigantians'-land).</p>
  <p>Then there came a check, caused perhaps by the bravery
  of <persName key="Arthur of Cumbria">Arthur</persName> of Cumbria, Head-King of the Britons, who seems
  to have had a regular army after the Roman fashion. But
  the growing numbers of the English, who still flocked across
  the North Sea to the new settlements, and the death of
  <persName key="Arthur of Cumbria">Arthur</persName>, brought on the second stage of conquest (<dateRange from="520" to="613">520-613</dateRange>),
  when there pushed forward-
  From WESSEX the Wiltsetas, Dorsetas, Somersetas, Magesetas
  (round Hereford), and Hwiccas (round Worcester).
  From the ANGLIAN or ENGLISH kingdoms the Marchmen
  (Borderers), who built up a great kingdom in the Midlands.
  The steps of this stage are marked by the battles. In <date value ="550">550</date>
  the West Saxons won Salisbury, in <date value ="571">571</date> the victory at Bedford gave them the country up to <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>; in <date value ="577">577</date>, by the famous fight at Dyrham, they also won the three great cities of Gloster, Cirencester, and Bath, cut off the Welsh of Cornwall from the Welsh of Wales, reached the Western Sea, and began to win and settle the Severn valley; finally, by the great battle at Chester, <date value ="613">613</date>, the Northumbrians also reached


<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>          <note type="header"  place="head"><dateRange from="400" to="613">[400-613.]</dateRange></note>
 the Irish Channel, and divided the Cumbrian Welsh (who held the east coast from Chester to Dumbarton) from their kinsfolk in Wales. The whole of the west slope and centre valleys of Britain were now in the hands of the English, and the three Welsh kingdoms were never able to unite again to withstand them.</p>
  <p>The chief things which weakened the Welsh and enabled the English to overcome them were a terrible famine which took place in the fifth century, the lack of many of their best soldiers, who were away in <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName> with their leaders, and did not come back to stop the invasion of their own land; but still more the selfish wickedness and never-ceasing quarrels of the Welsh princes.</p>
  <p>The struggle was throughout very cruel and deadly, for the Welsh and English were of different tongues and faiths, and would never mix with each other as had happened in other parts of the Roman empire (for instance, in <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName>, where the conquering Franks and the conquered <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName>s became one people, using the Latin tongue). Hence, too, the English kept their own tongue and ways unchanged.</p>
  <p>All the villages and many towns in East Britain were broken down, fired, and left waste, like Anderida (Pevensey),
Uiriconium (Wroxeter), and Chester; but others, like London and <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, were spared and settled by the English chiefly for convenience of trade, for it was not till much later that the English became a nation of townsfolk.</p>
   <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">Legends of the Conquest. </note>The history of these two hundred years of conquest must be pieced together out of different sources, for when the English became Christians they grew ashamed of their heathen forefathers, and the Welsh stories have mostly perished. But two famous legends, that of the <hi rend="italics">Conquest of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName></hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Wars of <persName key="Arthur of Cumbria">Arthur</persName></hi>, have come down to us. The first tells how <persName key="Vortigern">Vortigern</persName>, Duke or King of
Britain, sent (after the Roman fashion of fighting barbarians by barbarian aid) to two Jute wickings [sea-rovers], <persName key="Hengist">Hengist</persName> and <persName key="Horsa">Horsa</persName>, praying them to help him against the Picts and
Scots. They came and defeated his foes and then made up their minds to win part of Britain for themselves, so they sent home for help, which soon came, and wintered in the Isle of Thanet. Then <persName key="Vortigern">Vortigern</persName>, for love of Romwen, <persName key="Hengist">Hengist</persName>'s daughter, betrayed his country and gave them the kingdom of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>; but Vortimer and Catigern, his valiant sons, fought four battles against them, in one of which, at Epsford,
Catigern and <persName key="Horsa">Horsa</persName> fell in hand-to-hand fight.  But at
Vortimer's death the Britons fled like fire, leaving <persName key="Hengist">Hengist</persName> lord of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, and he won still more land; for having entrapped


<pb id="p.13" n="13"/>

<persName key="Vortigern">Vortigern</persName> and the British princes to a great feast, he slew them by treachery, forcing the king to ransom himself by giving up London and a great part of his kingdom. Merlin the wizard set up the huge blocks of <placeName key="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</placeName>, bringing them from Ireland to Salisbury Plain to stand as a memorial over the murdered nobles. The wicked <persName key="Vortigern">Vortigern</persName>, spurning the warnings of S. Germanus, the Gallic missionary Bishop of Auxerre, who rebuked him for his sins, was at last destroyed in his palace by fire from heaven.</p>
   <p>Better known and grander, but mixed up with other stories
 so that it is difficult to get any fact out of them, are the tales
 of the last mighty British king, <soCalled>"great-hearted <persName key="Arthur of Cumbria">Arthur</persName>,"</soCalled> who
 beat the English in twelve pitched battles in the north, stemming the tide of invasion by his prowess and that of his
 good knights Kay and Bedivere and Gawain and Owain, but
 perishing in the end at the hands of a traitor kinsman: in life
 and death alike the very type of a Keltic hero.</p>
 <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">The English people. Their government.</note>The English were a nation of franklins or freeholders,
 living by their land and cattle, every man in his
 own homestead. A knot of neighbouring homesteads owned by men of the same kindred
 formed a village called by the family name (Wallingford=
 the ford of the Wallings, Buckingham=the home of the
 Bockings, Billing=the Billings'). House and yard and cattle
 were the property of the household, but the tilth meadow and
 pasture of the village were held in common by all, being
 divided afresh every year so that each household should
 have its fair share. This and all other village business was
 settled by the village moot or meeting of the heads of households (much as in New England now) and their chosen
 officers, the village-reeve, the pinder, the beadle, and the like.
 A number of villages were grouped into a hundred, so
 called because at first it was made up of one hundred and
 twenty households, each sending one armed man to court,
 council, or war. In the hundred-moot, the criminal court of
 the district, which met at least four times a year, disputes
 between man and man were settled and measures taken
 against crime; musters of the district <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>fyrd</foreign></hi> or war-levy were
 also held. A hundred-elder presided at it. The chief court
 of the whole tribe, above all these, was the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>folk-moot</foreign></hi> or tribe-parliament, which met twice a year to settle great matters,
 such as war and peace, law-making, choosing or putting
 down kings, appeals, disputes between noblemen, quarrels
 between different villages and hundreds, and so on. The
 king was the head of this meeting, the nobles and gentlefolks


<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>
         <note type="header"  place="head"><dateRange from="400" to="900">[400-900.]</dateRange></note>
 spoke, but every point was carried or thrown out by the votes of the freeholders present.</p>
  <p>Afterwards, when several smaller kingdoms were brought together under the rule of head-kings, they used to hold a meeting of the greatest men of all their under kingdoms, called
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>Witena-gemot</foreign></hi> or Wise Men's meeting, which dealt with matters touching their whole dominions. The folk-moot was still the chief court for each separate little kingdom, and was held by an alderman or viceroy of the head-king, who sent a shire-greeve [sheriff] as his steward to sit with him and see that the royal property was properly looked after.</p>
   <p>4. <note place="foot" n="4">Law.</note>An old English moot dealing with criminal law was like a public meeting of to-day, with its chairman, the king or alderman, who kept order, "spoke" or declared the law, and saw the wish of the meeting carried out; its committee, the sworn witnesses or grand jury chosen from the body of the meeting to accuse evil-doers, hear evidence, and say on which side the burden of proof lay; its speakers and their seconders, the plaintiff and defendant with their witnesses and bailsmen. Proof was taken by ordeal of fire or water (in which the accused had to carry a piece of red-hot iron or dip his arm in boiling water, being held guiltless if after seven days he had not suffered), or by compurgation (where a man had to get a certain number of people differing according to their rank or his offence to swear to his innocence). The courts were held in the open air, generally on a hill where all could see and hear.  Offences were punished by fine or in worse cases by outlawry (when the criminal was put outside the pale of the law and might be killed like a wolf). Only murder [secret killing], witchcraft, and treason were punished by death (hanging for men, drowning for women). Slaves and vagabonds were whipped or put in the stocks.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="5">Ranks.</note>There were three classes among the old English; two free, gentle (<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>eorl</foreign></hi>) and simple (<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>ceorl</foreign></hi>), and one unfree, slave (<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>theow</foreign></hi>), each with its <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>were-gild</foreign></hi>
[man-price] payable to the kindred or master of any one who killed a man. If a gentleman was a knight of the king's
(<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>thegen</foreign></hi>) or his henchman (<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>gesith</foreign></hi>) his were-gild was higher.
Most freemen lived on their own homesteads, but some would take service as henchmen with the king or aldermen or rich gentlemen, whose pride it was to have a body of retainers about them, to guard them in peace, follow them in war, and be standing proof of their riches and bounty; for they fed, clothed, and armed them, paying them by gifts


<pb id="p.15" n="15"/>
 of weapons, gold rings, cattle, and sometimes farms (for no man's wages were paid in money in those days). Hence the old English poets call kings and princes Lord (loaf-giver) and
<hi rend="italics">Ring-bestower</hi>, and love to sing of the faithfulness of the hench-man and the generosity of his patron. Some landless freemen took up trades and crafts, and were smiths, carpenters, fishermen, huntsmen, or merchants; others worked on or farmed richer folk's land. For though at first in the villages every household had its ethel or share, yet in time the arable land got divided for ever among them nearly everywhere once for all instead of being shared out year by year; and so some became better off than others. Moreover, in each kingdom were large spaces of unenclosed land, commons, belonging to the tribe and not yet parcelled out; pieces of this the king and wise men from time to time granted or booked to churches or king's henchmen, to hold as their own, so that, as nowadays, some men had large estates. In
Christian times the monks were great landowners, and many people were employed, free and bond, on their estates.</p>
   <p>Slaves worked on their master's land or in his house, like
 our servants, the men as swineherds, neatherds, or labourers;
 the women grinding the corn in stone querns, and looking
 after the milking, cooking, and household drudgery. In the
 east of England slaves were few, but there were many in the
 west, chiefly captive Welsh. A man might fall into slavery
 for some crime that he had done, or he might sell himself
 for bread in time of famine or distress. There was a regular
 slave-trade carried on between <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName> and Ireland and
 London and <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName>, some men being so wicked as even to sell
 their own children into bondage.</p>
   <p>6. <note place="foot" n="6">An old English homestead.</note>The best way of showing what old England was like
 will perhaps be to describe one of the larger
 homesteads with its indwellers and their daily
 life. The house is a group of high-gabled one-storied timber
 buildings thatched or tiled--the hall a general eating and
 living room, the <hi rend="italics">bower</hi> or women's room, besides kitchens,
 cow-byres, stables, and storehouses--all standing in a square
 yard fenced about with a bank and hedge, and perhaps a
 moat round the whole.</p>
   <p>The owner of such a place is dressed in linen shirt and
 hose spun and woven at home, and a short frock reaching
 the knee of fine red or blue cloth embroidered at the edges
 and fastened round the waist with a leathern belt, to which
 hung a sheath knife with carved hilt. On his feet are black
 leather shoes, and bands of linen like Indian <hi rend="italics">putties</hi> are

<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>
 twisted round his leg from ankle to knee. His head is bare, his hair long and braided, his beard forked, his throat and breast tattooed; on his arms and wrists are three or four armlets of gold, and on his finger a gold ring with his name or a charm cut round it. If he were going on a journey he would take his sword and round wooden buckler, and if he rode, a ten-foot ashen iron-headed spear. In bad weather he wears a short rough cloak clasped at the shoulder with a large brooch of wrought gold or yellow bronze. In war a mail shirt covers his body and a leathern or metal helmet, with the figure of a boar on it, his head. His servants are dressed in the same style but less richly; if slaves, they are barefoot with cropped heads, long hair being a sign of freedom.</p>
  <p>The housewife also wears linen clothes and over them a gown of bright cloth, worked over with needlework in fine patterns, and in winter a mantle with two brooches at the neck; her head is covered with a linen veil (only unmarried girls go bareheaded); at her girdle hangs her pouch for needles and thread and her keys ; in her hand is her distaff.</p>
  <p>Masters and servants all dine together (before noon) at the long hall tables served by the women; the meat is handed round on spits, and the cups and drinking-horns filled from wooden buckets on a sideboard. Every man has his own loaf and uses his own knife and wooden spoon. Porridge and milk (cows' or ewes') and barley bread were the staple food; but a rich man's table never lacked beef and mutton in the summer, and salt meat, pork, or game in the winter. In the heathen times horse-flesh was eaten at the sacrificial feasts; but this was forbidden when Christendom came, and fish then became the regular food twice a week on fast-days.
Ale and mead were the commonest drinks, but kings and nobles often drank wine brought from abroad.</p>
  <p>There was not much furniture in the house, a few curtains and hangings of needlework, trestle tables, benches, large carved chests for clothes, linen, and plate, two or three bedsteads (the servants slept on the benches or the floor), and a high carved chair for the head of the house. The fires were on hearths in the middle of the floor, and the smoke got up through a hole in the roof. There were a few windows under the eaves and gables, these were covered with skin or linen dipped in oil.</p>
  <p>There was plenty to do on the farm all the year round. The master would be out all the morning with his sons and men, and after dinner and an hour's rest would go back to work

<pb id="p.17" n="17"/>
 till sunset, when there would be supper and all would go to bed. The women were cooking and baking and spinning under the mistress's eye. Ploughing and sowing and harrowing, hedging and ditching, were the first outdoor labours of the year; then after the lambing season was over and the winter cut wood had been carted and stacked, hay-making set in; then came the harvest. When the corn was carried, hawking and hunting began, and the herds of swine were driven to the woods to fatten on the mast and acorns; when the leaves had fallen, the corn was thrashed and winnowed, beer was brewed, and cattle and pigs killed and salted for the winter. At Yule there was feasting and holiday for a fortnight. In the spring people went maying and set up Maypoles.
Midsummer was a time for merry-making and gatherings of all kinds, fairs, markets, races, horse-fights, and games.  The courts were held at such seasons, and in heathen times the sacrifices. Till the Christian calendar came in the week was of five days, and there was no day of rest like our Sunday.</p>
  <p>7.<note place="foot" n="7">Religion</note> The English believed in many gods. <hi rend="italics">Thunder</hi>, bluff and red bearded, whose car rattled in the storm as he hurled his lightning hammer at his foes the giants; <hi rend="italics">Woden</hi>, father of victory, wisest of gods and men, knowing all things past and to come, since he sold one of his eyes (by the lack of which he was known when he walked in disguise among men) for the Water of Wisdom; <hi rend="italics">Tew</hi>, bravest of the gods, who gave his right arm to save the heavenly powers from hurt; <hi rend="italics">Frey</hi>, bestower of riches and good seasons; <hi rend="italics">Heimdall</hi>, the giant god, father of mankind; <hi rend="italics">Eager</hi>, the cruel sea-god that takes down drowning men; <hi rend="italics">Ran</hi>, his wife, who catches them in her net; <hi rend="italics">Freya</hi>, the beautiful goddess whose magic necklace, love-inspiring, was the most precious of jewels
<hi rend="italics">Beadu</hi>, lady of war; the <hi rend="italics">Weirds</hi>, goddesses of fate, strongest of all; and <hi rend="italics">Hell</hi>, the black giantess that kept the souls of the wicked in her cold, dark, snake-haunted caves. All these and more they feared or loved, besides believing in <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">>etyns</foreign></hi>
[giants], ogres, and such monsters as the two Wolves that are ever chasing the sun and moon, and sometimes grip hold of them for a space, so causing eclipses; <hi rend="italics">dwarves</hi>, little clever spiteful beings <quote>"that ever dwell beneath the ground nor dare behold the sun,"</quote> making magic weapons and charmed rings, and digging out the treasures of the earth; and elves, fairies of the woods and meadows and wells.</p>
  <p>The English buried or burned their dead carefully for fear their angry souls should haunt the spot where the uncared-for



<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>
 body lay; and as they thought the after life was just like this one, they put food and drink and weapons and horses into the grave with him that the soul might pass its spirit-life happily hunting by night in the woods and feasting by day inside the <hi rend="italics">barrow</hi>.</p>
  <p>The gods' temples were large halls inside a wooden fence into which no armed man might come. The wooden stocks which stood for the images of the gods, the holy ring on which oaths were sworn, the blood-stone on which the beasts were slain for sacrifice, were kept there.  Here the hallowed feasts were held with the flesh of the horses and boars offered to the idols, and fresh-brewed ale in which toasts were drunk to the gods' honour. The temple-keepers, many of whom were women, had no power like the Druids, every householder being priest for his household, and the king for the tribe; but they were consulted as soothsayers, and would go round the country from house to house practising their witchcraft, pretending to make spirits show themselves to men to foretell the future, and " sitting out" in desert places to raise the dead to answer the questions of the living. A tenth of war-spoil was given to the gods, and probably temple-dues paid.</p>
   <p>8. <note place="foot" n="8">Poetry.</note> The English were fond of poetry and singing to the harp.  Every king had his gleeman, who was loved and honoured by all, for on him it depended whether a man's brave deeds should go down to those that came after him. One of the ways the missionaries found most powerful in getting the people to listen to the
Gospel was the putting of Latin hymns into English and singing them in the streets. The church chanting, which was strange to them, also pleased the people much. Old
English verse was not like ours, rhymed, but alliterative or <hi rend="italics">letter-catching</hi>-one stressed word in each half of a line must begin with the <hi rend="italics">same consonant or a different vowel</hi>. The piece given below will show how it was. Their poetry was either <hi rend="italics">epic</hi>, telling stories of gods or heroes, or <hi rend="italics">didactic</hi>, teaching useful knowledge, often by proverbs (for the heathen
English had no books). The heathen poems are unhappily lost, though we know some of the stories they told about <hi rend="italics">Wey-land</hi>, the cunning smith, his brother, <hi rend="italics">Egill</hi>, the mighty archer, and <hi rend="italics">Wade</hi>, with his magic boat; <hi rend="italics">Sigmund</hi>, that slew the dragon and got the golden hoard; <hi rend="italics">Waldhere</hi>, and his feats of war; <hi rend="italics">Finn</hi>, and the fight at Finnsboro', his hall, and others.
One whole poem written by a Christian about a heathen hero is left, and it shows what these older poems were like; it tells

The next two hundred years are taken up on one hand by the conversion of the English, first begun by Roman, but chiefly carried out by Scottish missionaries, the settlement of the English Church, and the changes it brought about; and on the other hand by the struggles of the great kings of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>

   It is told that while <persName key="Gregory I">Pope Gregory</persName> was yet a simple priest he chanced to see some young English boys at the slave-market in Rome. Struck by their white skins, light hair, and fair faces, he asked who they were, of what faith and nation.

Then touched with pity he went to the Pope and asked leave to go to England and preach the Gospel there, but the

  <p><persName key="Augustine">Augustine</persName> tried to get the Welsh clergy to take him as their archbishop and join him in preaching to the heathen
English; but they would not, whereupon he told them that since they did not choose to live in peace with their Christian brethren and share their work, they should meet a punishment from heathen foes. Now the first king that became
Overlord of England was <persName key="AEthelfrith">&#x00C6;thelfrith</persName> of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, who having beaten the Scots at Catterick in <date value ="603">603</date>, now in <date value ="607">607</date> gained the great victory of Chester (which was spoken of above) over the Welsh princes. To that battle there came from
Bangor a congregation of Welsh priests and monks to pray for their countrymen's success; but <persName key="AEthelfrith">&#x00C6;thelfrith</persName>, having routed the princes, took and slew 1200 of these monks, saying that they had done their best to overthrow him by their prayers.

<placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> and set the Church in order; but he died at Rome, so the Pope chose Theodore of Tarsus and sent him to England.
Theodore made rules for government of the Church, marked out the bishops' sees, set priests in every village as far as he could, and looked after the training of priests and the good order of the church in every way, so that it is on his foundations that the Church of England has built ever since.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="5">Overlordship of <placeName key="Marchland">Marchland</placeName> kings in the eighth century.</note>  The last Northumbrian overlord was <persName key="Oswiu">Oswiu</persName>'s son <persName key="Ecgfrith">Ecgfrith</persName>, who, not content with conquering the
Welsh of Cumbria and ravaging the Irish coast,
<date value ="684">684</date>, at last crossed the Forth into Fife to fight against his cousin Brude, the King of the Picts in spite of the warning of his bishop, <persName key="Cuthbert">S. Cuthbert</persName>.  But being drawn into an ambush at Dunnichen or Nectan's Fort, north of Tay, he and his men were cut off and slain.
The enemies of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> now rose against her, and she was never able to hold the overlordship again, the March kings seizing and holding it for nearly a century, though there were several powerful West Saxon kings during that time. Such was <persName key="Ine the Wise">Ine the Wise</persName>, who conquered Essex, built
Taunton as a border fort against the Cornish king, and at last, like many other kings of this age, bethought him that all worldly glory must pass, and so, seeking a kingdom that

<pb id="p.25" n="25"/>

 should be everlasting, gave up the crown he had worn thirty-seven years, and went with his wife to Rome, where they died.</p>
  <p><persName key="Offa">Offa the Mighty</persName> (<dateRange from="757" to="796">757-796</dateRange>), the last great king of the
Marchmen, was the most powerful ruler yet seen in
England. He made all the under-kings obey him, built the
Great Dyke (called after him) from Chester to Chepstow, forcing the Welsh to keep behind it. He was also a law-giver and a friend of learned men. It was he that sent
Alcwine and other teachers to <persName key="Charlemagne">Charles the Great</persName>, for England was now famous for learning; and the poet <persName key="Cynewulf">Cynewulf</persName>, whose sweet verses we have still, lived in his time. He made friends with the Pope, and promised him Peter's pence or
Rome-scot, obtaining from him leave to have an archbishop of his own at Lichfield (as the other two great kingdoms,
<placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> and <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>, had theirs at <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and Canterbury), because J&#x00E6;nberht of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> had tried to bring in an army of Franks to overthrow him. Only one Archbishop of Lichfield ever sat, however, for <persName key="Offa">Offa</persName>'s son made peace with
<placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>- and gave up his father's plan. It was <persName key="Offa">Offa</persName> that built the first Abbey of S. Albans. After <persName key="Offa">Offa</persName>'s death his kingdom grew weak and left place for the rising power of
<placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>.</p>
<p>6.  <note place="foot" n="6">The first great Churchmen of England.</note> In the seventh and eighth centuries there were many great Churchmen in England. <persName key="Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>, the single-hearted bishop and hermit, who preached peace and watchfulness and humility; Chad, never weary in labouring for the Lord; <persName key="Benedict">Benedict</persName>, founder and builder of churches and schools, parts of which are still standing; <persName key="Hilda">Hilda</persName> the princess, abbess of <placeName key="Whitby">Whitby</placeName>, where dwelt <persName key="Caedmon">C&#x00E6;dmon</persName>, the poor monk who was said to have received the gift of poetry from an angel, and sung the Bible history in poems, parts of which have come down to us; and many other holy men and women of all ranks, kings and queens and slaves alike, who laboured for the Church and the poor, some in their places in the world, others in the more peaceful labours of the minsters.
Nor were the English, any more than the Irish, content, now that they themselves were Christians, till they had spread the Gospel abroad in lands still heathen, especially among their kinsmen on the mainland. Famous among their missionaries are <persName key="Wilfrith">Wilfrith</persName>, sometime Archbishop of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, who being wrecked on his way to Rome to appeal to the

 of the old Saxons; and above all <persName key="Boniface">Boniface</persName> (whose
English name was Winfrith): he took up in Middle and
South Germany the work S. Gall and his Irish had begun, and by the help of the Franks and the Pope, who loved and honoured him exceedingly, evangelized great part of those lands and was made Archbishop of Mainz. He died a martyr in Friesland, <date value ="733">733</date>.</p>
  <p>7. <note place="foot" n="7">Results of the change of faith.</note> In becoming
Christians under one great church system the English were brought together more than they had ever been before, for the Church paid no respect to persons, and a Mercian might be made archbishop in <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, or a West Saxon become monk in Northumberland; so that all Englishmen began to look upon themselves as of one great nation, though the separate kingdoms still existed. The bishops also did their best to keep these different kingdoms at peace with one another, and even with the Scots and Welsh, so that we hear of no more massacres like those at <placeName key="Heathfield">Heathfield</placeName> and Chester; and when a piece of country was now won from the Welsh, the conquered people were suffered to dwell beside their conquerors and protected by law, not as before, slain or thrust down into slavery to till the lands their fathers had owned and dwelt upon.</p>
   <p>The clergy became a great power among the English, for by the side of every lay officer or magistrate there was a clerical one.  Besides the head-kings, the archbishops; by the folk-kings, the folk-bishops or diocesans; and in the village moot, the parish priest. These clergymen took part in all courts and moots, had were-gilds like laymen, and received fines and gave punishments for spiritual offences, such as evil-living, breach of church rules, and the like.</p>
  <p>The monasteries, large establishments to which men retired under vows to live strictly for the love of God, were numerous and rich; and the monks did a great deal of good, caring for the poor, tending the sick and helpless, guesting travellers on their way through the country, tilling the waste lands in which their minsters stood, often reading, writing and copying books, and keeping schools. In their gardens were first grown many useful shrubs and plants never before seen in England, and in their libraries books were preserved and stored which otherwise would have perished. Life in a well-ordered monastery was not idle: poorly and thinly clad and faring badly, the monk was obliged to attend the church offices, which came at frequent intervals throughout the day and night, and to sit in the chapter meeting, where were settled the business, discipline, and order of the house, and

<pb id="p.27" n="27"/>

 to do his share of the common work, however menial it might be, submitting without a murmur to the absolute rule of the abbot, however harshly exercised.</p>
  <p>8. Learning in England. <persName key="Bede">B&#x00E6;da</persName>.Now that the English belonged to a Church which prevailed over West Europe, they naturally mixed more with other neighbouring nations, especially the Franks of <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName> and Germany, and so came to learn many fresh arts, such as glass-making and masonry, and much knowledge, such as the Roman alphabet, which soon took the place of their old Rune-Row. Writing was now used for books, and Englishmen learned Latin and Greek and set books out of these tongues into their own. They also began to write books themselves, chiefly sermons, Bible comments, histories, geographies, and calendars, just such kind of works as are most read in England now. The greatest writer of these days was the <persName key="Bede">Venerable B&#x00E6;da</persName> (died <date value ="742">742</date>), a monk of Jarrow.
He fixed the year of the Lord by which we all reckon now, and wrote the famous History of the English Church, which though in Latin is the first history-book made in England, and tells us most of what is known of our early forefathers.
He also Englished the Gospel of John, wrote a life of
<persName key="Cuthbert">S. Cuthbert</persName>, and many more pious and learned works.  His
English hymns, one of which he sung on his deathbed, were popular long after his days.</p>

Sailing into the broad river-mouths, they first threw up a stockaded earthwork as their headquarters, and then began scouring the country far and wide, slaying the people, burning the towns and minsters, and carrying off the cattle and goods, till the land was left bare, when they would sail home with their booty.

The success of those Scandinavian wickings was partly owing to their good discipline and the swiftness in attack and retreat which their ships gave them, but more to the fact that England was still made up of many separate states, which would not or could not act together, though no one of them alone save <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>, which had a strong central government, was powerful enough to cope with the invaders.
Moreover, though the English had been continually warring

 against each other, they had hitherto had no foe from abroad to guard against, and so lacked war-vessels and coast-fortresses, for the Roman forts were fallen to decay.</p>

<persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName>, and became Christians. From <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> to <persName key="AEthelred">&#x00C6;thelred</persName> the West Saxon kings brought all England (Saxon, Mercian, and Danish alike) under one rule, casting out all the under-kings that remained, and also forced the Welsh and Scottish princes to bow to them; thus making themselves not only kings of all England, but also emperors of Britain.</p>

  <p>So <persName key="AEthelbald">&#x00C6;thelbald</persName> was chosen head-king and ruled well and prosperously, the Danes being put to flight.

That very year there came to England a mighty

England and settle it. There are two stories told of their coming. The English say that Osbryht, King of Northumberland, had carried off the wife of one of his nobles, Biorn the

But the Danes say that <persName key="Ragnar">Ragnar</persName> the great wicking had been shipwrecked on the coast of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, and that the king had ordered him to be thrown into a pit full of snakes, which when his sons heard they swore to take vengeance on the English for their father's death.

Eadmund the under-king, a holy and righteous man, and took him and slew him with arrows. His body was laid in a town now called after him, and he was held a martyr by the
English. Then in <date value ="870">870</date> the heathen Host came through the land to attack <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>, but the West Saxons and their kings met them boldly and fought nine pitched battles against them in one year, along the West Saxon borders.

England, setting up an under-king of their own choice in <placeName key="Marchland">Marchland</placeName> to rule part of it, but dividing the rest of the March and all the south of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> among themselves, settling there under King Halfdan, and parting the land by lot, and sowing and tilling it as their own (<date value ="876">876</date>).</p>
  <p>The rest of the Host, under Guthrun the Dane and <persName key="Ubba">Ubba</persName>

But Guthrum built a fort at Chippenham and drove King

<persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> into Athelney, an island in the Parret marshes, where he stayed for seven weeks in <date value ="878">878</date>; but being encouraged by a vision and joined by all the good men and true out of the west, he was able to beat the Danes at Eddington and besiege them so straitly at Chippenham that they were obliged to make peace with him, swearing to become Christians and to leave his realm for ever. So Guthrum was baptized at
Aller, King <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> being his godfather and giving him a new name-<persName key="AEthelstan">&#x00C6;thelstan</persName>. And next year he led his people into East England, where they settled down and parted the land among them. Those who were not content to dwell in
England went off to join another great host of Danes that were plundering <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName> and Germany, and some of these wicking in <date value ="921">921</date> settled in Normandy (which was called after them), under Hrolf [Rollo], and became Christians too.</p>
  <p>It was in this war, which took up the first part of his reign, that <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> is said to have had all those famous adventures of his in the swineherd's hut and the Danish camp and the little island fastness. But what is certain is that his bravery saved <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>, that from henceforward no more Danes were able to win land in England, and those who had settled in the north and east began to live peacefully among the English, being now of like faith.</p>
  <p>10. <note place="foot" n="9"><persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName>'s righteousness, learning, godliness, and wisdom. </note><persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> now set himself to work with all his might for his people's weal. Seeing that "a realm must be established by righteousness," he and his Wise
Men set many good laws, both new and old, and the king had them kept, punishing evildoers, especially bad judges and robbers, very strictly. And since he found that the Danes had swept awayall learning in the north of England, killing the priests and monks and burning their schools and libraries, he sent abroad for learned clerks to come and teach his people; such men as Asser the Welshman, whom he made Bishop of Sherborne, John the old Saxon, and
Grimbold the Frank, and there came even wise men from
Ireland to visit him, hearing of his love of knowledge. He also set up schools, to which he sent his own sons and the young nobles and gentlemen of his realm. He had many good books put into English for the unlearned, translating some of them himself, as <hi rend="italics">Orosius' History</hi>. He also ordered the old English history down to his own day to be written in a book in English, and chained to a desk in <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>
Minster. It is from this noble <hi rend="italics">Old English Chronicle</hi>, which was carefully kept and added to from time to time down to the
<pb id="p.33" n="33"/>
 crowning of <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>, that most of our knowledge of England after <persName key="Bede">B&#x00E6;da</persName>'s time comes. <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> also collected all the old English poems he could hear of, being very fond of them from his youth up, as the story about the pretty painted book of songs which he learned shows; but they have unfortunately been lost, as have also <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Sayings</hi>, and his <hi rend="italics">Handbook</hi> of notes on all kinds of subjects.</p>
  <p>He was a good friend to the Church, building and restoring minsters, putting good priests and bishops over his people, and giving alms to the churches in Rome, Jerusalem, and
India as well as to the poor at home. His own life was godly and upright; though his health was bad he never spared himself, but worked hard, setting out his time every hour in the day to its appointed task, and taking little ease, though he was fond of hunting and hawking and singing. <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName>, first of all English kings, found out the real way to stop the
Danish invasions, by fortifying the towns, building and keeping a fleet, and so ordering his levies that in every shire in
<placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName> there should be half the fyrd (militia) under arms, while the other half were working at home. He built ships against the ashes "full nigh twice as large as they, some with sixty oars, some with more, both swifter and stancher and higher than the others," after his own design, and got
Frisians to teach his English how to manage them.  His income he divided into two halves, with the first of which he paid his servants, workmen, and the foreigners who came to see him; the other half he gave to the poor, the monks, and the school. His favourite maxim was that on the welfare of the priest, the soldier, and the yeoman depends the wellbeing of a kingdom; and, in a word, he did all he could to bring this about.</p>
  <p>So great was his fame that the Welsh princes came of their own will and took him as their lord in <date value ="885">885</date>, swearing to be faithful to him if he would keep them against the Danes.
Thus he was Overlord of All Britain south of the Humber,

  <p>His great deeds made him famous, and many foreign kings sought his friendship. Harold Fairhair of Norway sent him his son to foster, and gave him a fine warship with a gilt prow and purple sails, and a row of gilt and painted shields round the gunwales. Hugh, Duke of the Franks, sought his sister in marriage, and sent him the Sword of <persName key="Constantine">Constantine</persName>, and the Spear of <persName key="Charlemagne">Charles the Great</persName>, and the holy Banner of S. Maurice as gifts, besides a piece of the True Cross, which was counted the most precious of all. Another sister was already married to the Emperor Otto, and two others afterwards wedded the King of Arles and the King of the
Franks. On October 27, <date value ="941">941</date>, <persName key="AEthelstan">&#x00C6;thelstan</persName> died, and his body lies in Malmesbury Minster, to which he had given the morsel of the True Cross and many other noble gifts.

But since it was then dark he was spared till next morning, and during the night as he lay sleepless he made a fine poem, in a new rhymed metre, in praise of the king's prowess and generosity, and sung it to him as ransom for his head.

  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="6">The south of England now become feudal.</note>The sons of <persName key="Eadweard the Elder">Eadweard</persName> had thus not only got into their own hands all the land the Danes had taken and settled, but were now ruling all England immediately without any under-kings.  This
Settlement of the Danes, which covered the land between
Watling Street and the borders of Essex and Bedford to the south, and Tyne to the north, and can be traced by the endings <hi rend="italics">-by</hi> and <hi rend="italics">-thwaite</hi>, which replaced the English <hi rend="italics">-ton</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">-ham</hi>, is a very important thing in English history. Not only did it help to change our tongue by bringing in many words such as <hi rend="italics">law, call, happy, fellow, skin, leg, wing, are, they, there, their,</hi> which we have preferred to their English equivalents, but had it not been for it, the whole of England would, like the south, have been feudalized, whereas this incoming of fresh Teutonic immigrants, filling the places of those English who had perished in the wars, kept the Danelaw at least in its old ways, so that it was, as in the eighth century, the home of a nation of free land-holding yeomen and franklins, ruling themselves and managing their own affairs, down to the days when the Normans came.</p>
  <p>But south and west of Watling Street a very different state of things had come about: during the long Danish wars the free yeoman, pressed by hunger, had given up his ethel to his richer neighbour, and sunk to be the rent-paying cottar of the gentry. The gentry, too, having all become <hi rend="italics">Thegens</hi> either of the king, the aldermen, or the Church, now held all their lands on condition of service; for they had given up their ethels too, taking them back as <hi rend="italics">thegen-land</hi> in return

<pb id="p.39" n="39"/>
 for protection promised them. In fact land in the south of
England was no longer allodial but feudal [held by rent, whether payable in kind, money, or service], and the government was almost entirely in the hands of the king and great men; excepting in the cities, where the householders, being richer and better protected by their walls, had been able to keep their old rights in great degree. The king's power also had grown in the wars; he held great state now like the kings abroad, with his Court officers-Staller [Marshall],
Dish-thegen [Butler], Bower-thegen [Chamberlain], Hoards-man [Treasurer], and Redesmen [Counsellors of State] about him. We hear more of the Wise Men and less of the
Folk-moots in law-making and governing, but of course all this strengthening of the central power was needful if
England was to become really one, and where the people were allowed to manage their own local affairs themselves, did little harm.</p>
  <p>7. <note place="foot" n="7">Church reforms resisted by southern nobles.</note> In the north the people, being many of them new converts, were zealous in wishing to reform the
Church in the south, where the nobles and king had got to treat the richer monasteries and cathedrals rather too much as places in which their younger sons and daughters could live comfortable lives; for even the monks and canons were growing lazy in riches, and having left their duties in the world, were, many of them, becoming careless of their duties in the minster. So that the more zealous Churchmen were trying both to bring in stricter rules among the monks themselves, and to replace the married priests in the cathedrals by monks under these rules, who they thought would work harder for the Church and the poor.</p>

  <p><persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName> was born about <date value ="915">915</date>, and sent by his father, Heahstan, to school at <placeName key="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</placeName>, whence he went as a youth to the court of <persName key="AEthelstan">&#x00C6;thelstan</persName>; but his talents made the other young thegens jealous, and they behaved so badly to him that he was persuaded to give up his hopes of a worldly career and become a monk. After passing a little time in retirement, he became chaplain to a rich lady, and now people seeing his wisdom and goodness began to think much of him and ask his advice in all kinds of matters; for besides his deep book-learning he was skilled in handicrafts, masonry, carpentering, smith-work, metal-casting, could draw, paint, and design beautifully, was an excellent musician, playing, singing, and composing well, and being especially fond of those old
English songs and lays which <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> too had delighted in.
He was also believed to have visions from which he was able to foretell the future. In <persName key="Eadmund">Eadmund</persName>'s days <persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName> came to court again, and the king seeing his worth, and moved by a narrow escape he had from death when hunting--he just checked his horse in time at the very brink of a high cliff- bethought him of the unkindness with which this pious young priest had formerly been treated, and to show his sorrow for not having stopped it made him Abbot of <placeName key="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</placeName>. In person <persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName> was small and slight, square headed, light haired, and bright eyed, he had a winning way which drew people to him, was a good and ready speaker, and feared nothing but sin. When <persName key="Eadwig the Fair">Eadwig</persName> had banished him he had gone to Gaunt,, and saw the strict way the monks lived in there, so, now that he was in power, he made the English monks live under this new rule, and though he himself was careful not to offend any one by his changes, Bishops
<persName key="Oswald">Oswald</persName> and &#x00C6;thelwald his friends were not slow in carrying out Oda's plans, and turning married priests out of the cathedrals and enforcing other reforms which the great nobles in the south did not at all like. They also built many new monasteries and nunneries and restored others, in which the king gave them ready help.</p>
  <p>10. At the beginning of <persName key="Eadgar">Eadgar</persName>'s reign the Scots and
Welsh, after their wont, began to make trouble, but Kenneth was pacified by the gift of Lothian being confirmed to him,

<persName key="Eadgar">Eadgar</persName> was solemnly crowned at Bath and thence went to Chester, where there met him six under-kings-the King of Scots and his kinsman and vassal the King of Cumbria, the King of Man, a Northman, and three Welsh kings, who all swore to be faithful to him. It is told that he was rowed down the
Dee to S. John's Minster by these six princes, he himself steering; when he told his courtiers, " Those who come after me may indeed call themselves kings, since I have had such honour." <persName key="Eadgar">Eadgar</persName> kept three fleets, one on each coast, south, east, and west of England, which were continually sailing along, guarding the sea-shore from the Danes, who feared him so much that even their kings in Dublin submitted to him.</p>
  <p><persName key="Eadgar">Eadgar</persName>'s laws were very stern, and he protected trade by putting down all wrecking and black-mailing of merchants, and keeping the roads clear of thieves and robbers. He governed his kingdom well, though if the songs about him be true, he could not always govern himself, for it is said that his late crowning (seven years after it should have been) was through a penance <persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName> laid on him because he had carried off a nun. His people, however, rightly loved his good rule, and mourned when, as the old verses tell-
      <quote rend="blockquote"><l>" Making an end : of the joys of this earth,</l>

<persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName>, though they had made up their minds to rule even at the cost of a crime. On the 18th of March <date value ="978">978</date>, <persName key="Eadweard the Martyr">Eadweard</persName>, who had no knowledge of their illwill to him, rode out in the evening alone to his stepmother's house in the wood near Corfe to ask after a favourite dwarf of his whom he hoped to find there. &#x00C6;lfthryth came out to answer his questions and begged him to alight, but he would not. Then she offered him a horn of wine, which as he was tired and thirsty he took. As he was drinking it to her health one of her followers thrust a broad knife into his left side. The king with a great cry fell swooning from his saddle, and the frightened horse dashed off dragging him along the rough wood-path by the stirrup-leather, which did not break till he was dead. When his men saw the horse come in bloody and riderless they went to seek him, but the queen had had the body taken up secretly and cast into a ditch, where it was found by a priest and buried with little honour at Wareham. A few of the Wise Men hastily met and chose <persName key="Aethelred II.">&#x00C6;thelred</persName> king. But though the murderers had got their wish, and
&#x00C6;lfthryth's son was crowned, it did not profit them, and
<persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName>, as he hallowed the new king, prophesied evil on the reign that had begun so ill. <persName key="Eadweard the Martyr">Eadweard</persName> was held a martyr by the monks and the northern English; and &#x00C6;lfhere, repenting, brought his body with great honour to Shaftesbury, where miracles were believed to be wrought by his tomb. The wicked queen, also stricken by remorse, went into a nunnery at Werewell, where <quote>"she served God in sackcloth and ashes"</quote> till her death. As the old song says of <persName key="Eadweard the Martyr">Eadweard</persName>--

That Danish kings came to rule in England at all was largely the fault of the young king, who was in every way unlike the noble rulers of the six generations before him. He cared for nothing but his own selfish pleasures, leaving the government to the evil counsellors and treacherous favourites in whom he trusted.
When he did act of himself his behaviour was foolish, cruel, and unjust.  <persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName>, that <soCalled>"Star of the Church,"</soCalled> dying early in the reign, but not before he had had occasion to rebuke the young king for regarding <quote>"silver rather than righteousness in his judgments,"</quote> there was no one to check his wickedness.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">Ravages of the Danes and Northmen, <date value ="988">988</date>-<date value ="1001">1001</date>.</note>Just at this moment the Danes and Northmen being hard pressed by civil war and by the Great Famine of <date value ="976">976</date>, which was sorely felt in Norway and Denmark, began to attack England, where they found a different welcome to that their fathers had got from  <persName key="Eadweard the Elder">Eadweard</persName> and <persName key="AEthelstan">&#x00C6;thelstan</persName>.   Not that the English were loath to defend themselves, for with a wise king to head them they could have kept their country safe enough.  Such a fight as Maldon,
<date value ="988">988</date>, shows this well enough, where, as the Lay tells us,
Byrthnoth the Old, Alderman of East England, withstood the Northmen's king, Anlaf Tryggvisson himself, and being struck down in the fight was nobly revenged by his thegens, who vowed not to fly a step, and fell one by one over his body.
So too, in <date value ="994">994</date>, when Anlaf and King <persName key="Swegen Forkbeard">Swegen Forkbeard</persName> the
Dane came against London with more than five hundred ships, and attacked the city with fire and sword, <quote>"they got more hurt than they ever thought any burghers could do them,"</quote> and were beaten off so bravely that Anlaf agreed to make peace, be confirmed (he had been baptized before in the Scillies), and promise never to come to England as an enemy again. But the courage and skill of the people were made of no effect by the laziness of <persName key="AEthelred II.">&#x00C6;thelred</persName>; the folly of the Wise Men, who were persuaded into buying off the Danes with gold, which of course was a mere inducement to them to come again; and the treason of &#x00C6;lfric, who had succeeded &#x00C6;lfhere as Alderman of the

Thus in <date value ="999">999</date>, when Swegen and his Danes were harrying <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, the king and the Wise Men settled to go against them with both the fleet and the army; "but when the ships were ready, they put it off from day to day and wore out the poor fellows on board the ships with toil, and ever the more forward things ought to have been, the later they were, time after time, and ever they let their foemen's host wax greater. And in the end the cruise came to nought but people's toil and waste of money and the emboldening of their enemies."</p>

But this step again was of little profit, for he brought his foes upon him again with double violence by ordering all the Danes that happened to be in England to be put to death on S. Brice's Day, November 13, giving out that he had been warned they were about to betray him and all his Wise Men and take the kingdom. Among those then killed in cold blood was Gunhild, <persName key="Swegen Forkbeard">Swegen</persName>'s sister, with her husband and child. Whereupon <persName key="Swegen Forkbeard">Swegen</persName> swore an oath to take <persName key="AEthelred II.">&#x00C6;thelred</persName>'s realm from him, and came to England with a large fleet. Thither shortly followed Earl Thurcytel the
Tall with sixty ships full of soldiers, most of whom had once been wickings and buccaneers, and were still heathen. As usual, the aldermen of the Marchmen, &#x00C6;lfric and his successor Eadric Streona, betrayed their country to the enemy, while the East English behaved best of all. Their alderman
Ulfcytel the Swift (who, like Eadric, had married one of

<persName key="AEthelred II.">&#x00C6;thelred</persName> going on board Thurcytel's ships with his family and sailing to Normandy, where he stayed till <persName key="Swegen Forkbeard">Swegen</persName> died.
When this happened, in <date value ="1014">1014</date>, the Danish army chose <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName>,

Six pitched battles were fought, the last of which at Ashington <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName> won, after a struggle in which
Ulfcytel the Swift was killed by Thurcytel (in revenge for his brother Heming, whom the East English alderman had slain), and nearly all the English nobles fell. After this
Eadric and the Wise Men brought the kings together at
Olney, and made them agree to divide the realm, <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName> taking

As soon, therefore, as he made his crown safe, by marrying &#x00C6;lfgifu, <persName key="AEthelred II.">&#x00C6;thelred</persName>'s widow, killing such traitors as Eadric and banishing the kinsmen of the last kings, he paid off and sent home nearly all his Danish troops, and dividing England into four great earldoms (<placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>,
<placeName key="Marchland">Marchland</placeName>, East England, and <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>), put an earl over each under himself. Having such a mighty empire, for when he died he was king of the Ostmen, Northmen, and
Danes, as well as the English, he was often away warring abroad, where his English thegens (especially <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName>, whom he made Earl of <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName> and married to his kinswoman) showed great skill and bravery. But <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName> paid the greatest attention to his English kingdom, making laws for it, and protecting it from the inroads of the Scottish kings, whom he compelled to swear faithfulness to him.</p>
  <p>To the Church he was a generous friend, building up the minsters and churches that suffered in the wars, raising stone chapels at Ashington and other places where he had won battles, and giving many gifts to cathedrals and minsters at home and abroad. He also took the body of &#x00C6;lfheah from London to <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> with great state. It is well known how he rebuked his courtiers for their flattery by
Southampton Water when the tide was coming in, and it is said that after this he never wore his crown again, but hung it on the Rood at <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, and set out for Rome to pray there for the forgiveness of his sins and the welfare of his people.</p>
  <p>The Pope and Emperor were glad to see him, and promised to let all English pilgrims henceforward pass freely through their dominions, and gave him many costly gifts.
He wrote home from Rome a letter to his people, in which he says, <quote>" I have vowed to God Almighty Himself to amend my life from this day in all ways, and to rule with righteousness and mercy, giving upright judgments. I therefore bid all my sheriffs and servants throughout my kingdom, as they care for my goodwill and their own safety, to use no unrighteous violence against any man rich or poor, but that all alike, high or low, shall enjoy fair law. Nor let any man turn aside therefrom, either for the favour of the king,

<pb id="p.47" n="47"/>
 or the power of the great, or to get money wrongfully, for I have no need to heap up wealth by unrighteousness. I have sent this letter before me that my people may be gladdened by my welfare, for as ye yourselves know, I have never spared, nor will I ever spare, myself or my labour in taking care for the needs of all my people."</quote> And it is certain that under his good rule England recovered from the misfortunes of <persName key="AEthelred II.">&#x00C6;thelred</persName>'s reign, and enjoyed peace and safety.</p>
  <p>Like other great kings, <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName> took delight in useful works, going on with the drainage of the Fens, and building towers and bridges and churches of stone (little used till his day save for church building). A great deal of <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName>'s success was owing to his guard of House-carles, two or three thousand picked men (many of them Thurcytel's buccaneers), whom he paid highly and kept strictly under laws which he himself gave them. This little standing army, which was always with him, was held the finest body of soldiers in the world.</p>
  <p>In <date value ="1035">1035</date> <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName> died at Shaftesbury, and was buried at
<placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>. He was a little man, but strong of body, pleasant spoken, but keeping his thoughts to himself till he was ready to act, fond of riches, yet spending them wisely, a good judge of men and not easily deceived. He was fond of hunting, and of poetry and singing. The verses he made about the monks of Ely's chanting are well known.</p>

South to please them; but as he was also chosen king in
Denmark, he did not come to England, and left his mother

England unhurt and sail back to Normandy. Next year the
West Saxons got tired of <persName key="Hartha-Cnut">Hartha-Cnut</persName>'s staying away, and choosing <persName key="Harold Harefoot">Harold</persName> for king, drove Emma out of England.

His rule was stern.

Heavy taxes were raised to pay off the fleet that had come with the king, and they were sent home. <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName> was called back from Normandy and kindly welcomed by his brother, and things were going on well, when <persName key="Hartha-Cnut">Hartha-Cnut</persName> went to the wedding of one of his great officers at Lambeth, and as he stood up to pledge the married pair, suddenly fell to the ground in awful anguish.

He was a quiet, pious man, loving the Normans, with whom he had been brought up, and their polished clerkly ways, and listening too much perhaps to their advice. But England was now really ruled by the three great earls-Siward the Stout of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, the conqueror of Macbeth and dread of the Scots, a stern old warrior as Shakespere paints him, who refused to die in his bed like a cow when his last illness came upon him, but called for his mail-coat and helmet, and so, axe in hand, met death; Leofric of the <placeName key="Marchland">Marchland</placeName>, the peacemaker, wise in the things of God and the world also; and, greatest of all, <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> of <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName>, the clever, persuasive statesman, whose sons Swegen and <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> had the earldoms of Hereford and East England, and whose daughter

<pb id="p.49" n="49"/>
 save in Church matters, which he and his Norman chaplains settled their own way, trying to bring in the French Church customs and greater strictness of life. England was now at rest and happy-in spite of a few bad seasons; some inroads of the Welsh and Northern wickings, quickly stopped; and the wickedness of Earl Swegen, who carried off the Abbess of
Leominster, and killed his own cousin Biorn in cold blood, for which he was rightly outlawed--till <date value ="1050">1050</date>.</p>

One of them trying to get into a man's house against his will wounded him, and was slain by the householder. Then Eustace got on his horse, and his men on theirs, and rode up and killed the man on his own hearth. Then they rode down the town killing about twenty men, and the burghers killed nineteen of them and wounded many more. Eustace burst out with a few men, and went to the king and told him how he had fared, and the king was very angry and bade <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> go and make war against
<placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, for Eustace had told the king that the guilt was the burghers' not his, though it was not so."</quote> However, <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> would not go, being loath to harm his own people, and fearing the king's anger he gathered a large army to over-awe him. The king sent for Leofric and Siward, and it looked like the beginning of a civil war, when after several parleys and a delay which tired out <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName>'s men, the great earl and all his family were banished and the queen sent to a nunnery.</p>
  <p>The Norman clerks, especially Robert the monk, whom the king made Archbishop of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> in remembrance of his kindness to him when in exile, now advised the king to send for <persName key="William I.">William</persName>, Duke of Normandy, his kinsman, and make him his heir; and he came with a great company of Frenchmen and paid <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName> a visit. William, the fifth from Hrolf, first Earl of Rouen, left (by his father
Robert's untimely death abroad on a pilgrimage in <date value ="1035">1035</date>) a child in the midst of enemies, had nevertheless by his wisdom and bravery overcome them all, and was now, though still a young man, the most powerful prince in France.

<persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName> took the duke round great part of his realm with him and entertained him and his men very generously, sending them away with splendid gifts, and no doubt some promise to do all he could to get <persName key="William I.">William</persName> the crown after his own death.</p>

The king withstood their demands for some time, so long indeed that the earl's army were very greatly stirred against him, so that <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> himself could hardly keep them still; while the king's men were very loath to fight against their own countrymen, nor did they wish the land to lie still more open to foreigners through their killing each other. Then Bishop Stigand and the Wise Men agreed to make peace, inlaw <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> and his sons, and out-law the French and Normans for raising the trouble between the earl and king. Robert and his friends as soon as they heard this leaped on horseback and rode through the town to the shore, cutting down all in their path, and then taking a leaky ship they found there, set sail at once for Normandy.
The queen was called back, Stigand was made archbishop in
Robert's room, and the power of the <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> family became stronger than ever.  Next Easter Monday the Great Earl died suddenly, stricken with palsy, as he sat at meat with the king, which gave rise to many tales against him. Earl
<persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> took his place (for Swegen, the elder brother, had died abroad on a pilgrimage) and filled it wisely and well, beating the Welsh so that they were never after a danger to
England, taking care that the law was kept, and so winning the love of all save <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName>'s Norman priests, whose reforms he did not care for (though he was a pious man.himself, and had even made a pilgrimage to Rome), and his own brother
<persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName>, who was made Earl of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> when Siward died, and ruled so harshly that <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> was driven to interfere.

  <p>About this time, as <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> was on a cruise in the Channel, he was shipwrecked on the coast of Ponthieu, and imprisoned by the earl till he should pay ransom; but <persName key="William I.">William</persName> of Normandy had him set free, asked him to Rouen, and treated him with great friendliness, getting him, however, to swear to marry one of his daughters, and help him to be King of
England when <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName> died, and to make the oath more binding he made him swear by a shrine which, unknown to

(6th January), the royal blood he had from his mother being enough to allow of his being taken as king, since he was so much the best man in England. Soon after he was crowned he married Ealdgyth, widow of Gryffydd, King of Wales, his old enemy, and daughter of Earl &#x00C6;lfgar, that he might gain the goodwill of her two brothers, for his kingdom was threatened on all hands. As <persName key="William I.">William</persName> was going out to hunt one morning, a messenger reached him with the news of <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName>'s death and <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>'s crowning. He turned home at once without a word, and after taking thought, and first sending to <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> to bid him remember his oath and give up the kingdom, made up his mind to invade England, for the answer was that the choice of the people and Wise Men had been made and could not be altered. <persName key="William I.">William</persName> began his preparations at once, getting many promises of help from his own barons, and gathering men from all lands to join his army in the hopes of good pay and plunder and the blessing on the undertaking which the Pope had sent the duke with a consecrated banner. For he was angry with <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> for his perjury and with Stigand for taking Robert's place, not having had any right explanation of their reasons. But while this huge host was fitting out on the French coast, <persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName> had got together a force of Flemings, and was set upon winning back his earldom by force; and <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName> [stern of counsel], King of Norway, choosing the time as a fit one for carrying out his long-cherished plan of trying to gain the English crown, had started across the North Sea and reached the Orkneys, whence he was going to coast southwards.</p>

  where he met Harold of Norway and the Orkney earls
 with 300 ships, and they agreed to go to England together.

 people could stay no longer away from home. Just as the ships had got to London, and the people reached their several shires, <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName> and <persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName> sailed into the Humber and up the
Ouse to <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, beat <persName key="Eadwine">Eadwine</persName> and <persName key="Morkere">Morkere</persName> at Fulford, and entered the city on Wednesday the 20th of September. The people made peace with them, and agreed to give them hostages of their faith and go with them southwards, whereupon the king and earl with their troops left the town.</p>
  <p>5. News of the Northmen's landing reached <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> of
England in London and he set off north, Stamford marching night and day, as soon as he could Bridge, Sept. 25. get the levies of the shires together. By the Sunday he reached Tadcaster and set his army in array, and next morning he passed through <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, hearing that <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName> of
Norway and <persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName>, with part of their men, were waiting for the hostages by Stamford Bridge beyond the city. There he came upon them unawares. It is said that <persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName> wished to retreat, but <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName> would not give way, but sent to the ships for more men, and set his men in array.
<persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName>'s son now rode forward and offered his brother peace and a third of the kingdom. Said <persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName>,
<q type="spoken">"If that had been offered before, many a good man would be alive now that will never come home any more, and England would be in better plight than it is. But what will my brother offer the Northman's king for his cost and trouble ?"</q> <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> answered, <q type="spoken">"Seven feet of earth, or more, seeing he is taller than most men."</q> <q type="spoken">"Go back and make ready for the battle,"</q> said the earl, <q type="spoken">"the Northmen shall never say that <persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName> forsook <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName> for his foes when he was in need. We will rather all of us die with honour here or win England with our swords."</q></p>
  <p>When <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName>, who stood by, knew who it was that had spoken to <persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName>, he said, <q type="spoken">"That English king was a little man, but he stood strong in his stirrups."</q> Then he set up his banner Landwaster, and went through the ranks of his men, forming them into a level line or shield-wall to resist the English attack. As he looked at the enemy advancing all in mail, and saw his own men armourless, for they had not thought of an attack, and the day was hot, he sung-
          <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Their helmets shine : would I had mine !</l>
          <l>Our rigging's lying : down at the ships."</l></quote>
The English fell on stoutly and broke the Northmen's shield-wall. But <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName>, seeing his men pressed,


<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>


 took his sword with both hands and dashed forward, scattering his enemies like smoke before him. As he fought <quote>"red to the elbows,"</quote> ringed round with foes, an arrow struck him in the throat-vein and he fell. The English cheered, but
<persName key="Godwinson, Tostig">Tostig</persName> went to the banner in the king's place, and though his brother again offered him peace, refused, saying that he and his men had made up their minds to win the day and avenge Harold or die there with him. But he too fell, and when the help came from the ships it was too late to change the fortunes of the day; still this last attack was the hottest part of the day's fight, and it was late ere the English drove the few unwounded survivors to flight. Even then one
Northman kept the bridge, over which his comrades were escaping, single-handed with 'his axe for a long while, and is said to have stricken down forty Englishmen. They offered him quarter, but he laughed at their offers; at last a man crept under the bridge in a boat, and thrusting a spear up through the planks into his body, under his mail-coat, killed him. Only the darkness saved the rest of the Northmen. Next day <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> made peace with the dead king's sons and the earls, and let them go away with 24 ships. The booty taken was very great, for <persName key="Hardrede, Harold">Harold Hardrede</persName> had been in the Greek emperor's
Waring-guard at Constantinople when he was a young man, and had gotten great riches there, and all his life after he had been warring in foreign lands and winning plunder, till he came home to rule with his nephew in Norway. This treasure he had taken to England to pay his men and buy over the English. <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName>'s son gave it all over to the care of Ealdred, the Archbishop of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, for the time, which made some of his soldiers discontented. Harold
Hardrede is a famous character in northern history, where his wonderful adventures and gallant end were long remembered. He was said to be the finest man of his age, taller and handsomer than either of his rivals <persName key="William I.">William</persName> or <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>, besides being a ready speaker, a good general, and a crafty statesman. He was very fond of poetry, and no mean poet himself.  His enemies called him  grasping and cold-hearted.</p>
  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="5">Hastings, Oct. 14, <date value ="1066">1066</date>.</note> On Mich&#x00E6;lmas Eve <persName key="William I.">William</persName>'s fleet of 9000 ships reached England, landing on the <placeName key="Sussex">Sussex</placeName> coast, where, at Hastings, a wooden castle they brought with them was set up. News came to <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> at <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, and he set out at once for London with his guard, sadly lessened in number by the late battle, bidding <persName key="Eadwine">Eadwine</persName> and <persName key="Morkere">Morkere</persName> follow him with their men; but they hung back, thinking to


<pb id="p.55" n="55"/>

 make terms with <persName key="William I.">William</persName> if <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> were slain. The king only stayed six days in London, and then with the levies of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> and Essex and some East English led by his two brothers, the men of London and his own guard, he marched south to meet <persName key="William I.">William</persName>, against the advice of Gurth and Leofwine, who wished him to stay at London till the levies from the rest of England could join him, letting them go forward with the men he had and lay waste the country to prevent
<persName key="William I.">William</persName> moving inland. But he would not have the land wasted, nor let them lead the army in his stead, though they feared the saints' vengeance on him because of his broken oath. He chose his ground skilfully along the steep brow of a long hill at Senlake near Hastings, stockading the front of his line with hurdles on an earthwork, to keep off the horsemen, in which the strength of the duke's army lay.
Several messages passed between the two camps; <persName key="William I.">William</persName> is said to have offered <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> to settle their quarrel by a single combat or an appeal to the Pope, but <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> said that God should judge between them. After a night passed by the English in watching and feasting round their fires, and by the Normans in resting and praying and confessing their sins to <persName key="Odo">Odo</persName>, Bishop of Bayeux, and his priests, who went through their camp, both captains drew out their men early on S. Calixtus' Day (14th October). <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> set up his two banners, the Golden Dragon of <placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName> and the Fighting
Man (his own standard), by the hoar apple-tree on the hilltop, and round it put his best men, the guard, the men of
London, and the levy of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>. They were all on foot, as was always the English way to fight, armed with large Danish axes, broadswords, and javelins, and clothed in helmets and coats-of-mail. The country-folk, ill armed with darts, clubs, and slings, were on either side. <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> ordered his men to keep the palisade, and on no account to leave their ground.
About eight o'clock the Norman army reached Senlake, and the duke made ready to attack the English.  He put his footmen, mostly archers, in loose order in front of his army, and the horsemen behind them in three bodies; he and his brothers, Earl Robert and Bishop <persName key="Odo">Odo</persName>, leading the Norman knights in the centre, where Thurstain the
White bore the holy banner the Pope had sent the duke with his blessing, while the French and Breton knights formed the wings to right and left, under Roger of Montgomery and Earl Alan of Brittany. All these horsemen, mailed and helmeted, bore large kite-shaped shields, long lances used overhand, and broadswords.</p>


<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>


  <p>A Norman minstrel named Taillefer (Hew-iron) began the battle; he rode up to the English line singing the Song of
Roland, <persName key="Charlemagne">Charles the Great</persName>'s paladin, and tossing his sword and lance high in the air and catching them as they fell; he wounded two Englishmen before he was killed. The Norman knights, when they found the archers could make no impression, charged up the hill, calling, <q type="spoken">"God help us! God help us !"</q> and tried to break the line. But the English kept the pale, cheering and shouting, <q type="spoken">"Out! out! Holy Cross!
God Almighty !"</q> cutting down horse and man with their two-handed axes and tumbling them backward down the slope.
After two attacks the Normans faltered, and there was a cry that the duke was slain, but he threw back his helmet to show his face, and rallied his men for a third onslaught.
The pale was now broken on the right, and in the centre
<persName key="William I.">William</persName> fought his way by main strength to the standards, where Gurth killed his horse with a spear-cast and fell by the duke's sword. Leofwine also fell, but the guard and main body were still able to hold their own. Then, as a last hope,
<persName key="William I.">William</persName> gave the signal for a feigned flight, and the English on the right broke their ranks, against <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>'s orders, and, cheering loudly, rushed after the horsemen down the hill. On the flats the Normans turned and cut them to pieces. <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>'s right wing being destroyed, the Normans could now get on the hill-top and fight him on level ground.
But they could not break his guard till the duke, seeing that the English had slung their shields round their necks that they might use their axes more freely, brought up his archers and ordered them to shoot high so that the arrows might fall on the English from above. One struck <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> in the right eye, and he fell at the foot of his standard. Eustace of
Boulogne with a few knights, who had sworn to take the standards, now rushed forward, beat down the Fighting Man and the Golden Dragon, and slew the dying <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>, one of them being brutal enough to mangle his body. The guards now gave way slowly, followed by the victorious Normans, till they came to a piece of swampy ground by a steep part of the hill, where the knights' horses being useless, the Englishmen turned to bay and killed a great number of their pursuers. But their leaders were gone, and no effort could now avail to retrieve the lost battle. <persName key="William I.">William</persName> checked the pursuit, and pitching his tent where <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>'s standard had stood, halted his army for the night. Next day Eadgyth Swanneck, a lady whom the dead king had loved, coming with other Englishwomen to search for their dead, found <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>'s



<pb id="p.57" n="57"/>


 disfigured corpse under a heap of dead. <persName key="William I.">William</persName> had it buried under a stone heap on the cliff at Hastings, saying that it was fit sepulchre for him who had guarded his land so well while he lived. But afterwards the canons of Waltham Holy Cross, the minster <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> had endowed, took it home with then and buried it, but no man now knows where the last old English king lies.</p>
  <p>7. <note place="foot" n="6">State of England at the Conquest. The land.</note>The state of England on the eve of the Norman Conquest is known to us from Domesday Book (see p. 68), which shows us a little nation of two million souls, three-fourths of whom are living by the land they till, the rest being townsfolk, gentry, and churchmen. The eastern and southern shires, especially <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, are the best tilled, richest, and most thickly peopled. There the downs and wold gave fine pasturage for sheep, the hursts, shaws, and copses on the hill shoulders affording fattening grounds for swine, and the hollows at the downs' foot, the river flats, and low gravel hills were the best and easiest land to plough and crop. Far the largest part of the country isforest, that is, uncleared and undrained moor, wood, or fen. If we take one of the 9250 villages or manors which are scattered over the country, it will be found that three-fifths of the land of each is waste untilled common land, one-fifth pasture, and one-fifth (half fallow each year under their rude system of farming) under plough, so that there was ample room for population to increase.</p>
  <p>8. <note place="foot" n="7">The towns</note>Ever since <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName>'s days the towns had been getting richer and more important as trading centres, fishing stations, and bulwarks against the Danes.
And by the settlement of these energetic sailors they had grown still further. An English borough was nothing more than a walled group of villages or parishes, each with its village-moot and officers, while the borough court was a hundred-moot. A city or port was like a walled shire, its husting presided over by the port-reeve, being a folk-moot; while its wards, each with its own alderman and ward-moot, were hundreds, each of course including two or three parishes. The burghers (householders) held all power, and made their own bylaws in their hustings and ward-moots, but the towns were practically managed by the Merchant
Gild, or Association of Traders, to which nearly every burgher belonged, for the purpose of protecting, furthering, and regulating the commerce and manufactures of the place.
The principal towns (London, <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName>, <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName>, <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>,
<placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, and <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>) were the exchanges,

             <note type="header"  place="head">[<dateRange from="900" to="1066">900-1066</dateRange>.]</note>
 inlets and outlets of the country's trade, whence imports from abroad (wine, silk, oil, ivory, glass, sulphur, dyes, gold and silver) were distributed about the country, while slaves, metals, and wool were taken to foreign lands in return.
A great deal of trade was done at the great annual fairs, especially  <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, Stourbridge, and Abingdon.  It should be noticed that from the days of <persName key="AEthelred II.">&#x00C6;thelred</persName> London was bidding fair to become the capital of England, being more central, easier of access, and richer than <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>.</p>
    <p>9. <note place="foot" n="8">Police and gilds </note>The old village system of communal ownership, such as still holds in Russia, having long broken down in England, and a man's family having
 slight hold or right over him, it was necessary to devise
 some other way of making people responsible for crimes
 committed among them. This was done by the system of
 frank- or peace-pledge, or frith-borrow, by which the country
 freeholders were grouped into sets of ten [tithings] under a
 tenth-head, each man in the tithing being obliged to act as
 perpetual bailsman for the other nine, producing the offender
 to the hundred-elder if a crime was committed, or paying
 the fine or were-gild for him. Landless men were obliged
 to find a lord whose frith-borrow or peace-pledge they would
 be in.</p>
    <p>Besides the merchant gilds in the towns, there was in nearly
 every big village a gild like our Benefit Societies or Farmers'
 Associations, formed for mutual help and protection, and for
 feeding the poor and providing burial and masses for dead
 members. Once a year, on the day of the patron saint of
 the gild, there was a gild-feast, when all the members, men
 and women, went to church in the morning in procession,
 passed the day in merry-making, and had a great dinner
 together, at which the fines, payable in ale, for the year were
 drunk.</p>
   <p>10. <note place="foot" n="9">Language.</note>Not only were changes made in the speech of North
 England by the new words brought in by the
 Danes, but in other ways the English tongue
 altered greatly in the eleventh century, getting rid of many old
 forms and inflexions, breaking down the old endings a, u, i, and
 an, un, on into e and en (as in modern German), and thereby
 being forced to use a more modern syntax. Of course the
 Norman invasion helped this very much, as the gentry speaking
 French and the learned Latin, left English to be a mere
 people's speech, neither written nor used by cultivated men.
 The two following specimens, of the middle and end of the
 century, will show some of these changes:-

 <p>11. <note place="foot" n="10">Summary of old English history.</note>The first six centuries of old English history is, as we
 have seen, full of cruel wars, with which our
 story has been mainly taken up, but it must be
 remembered that in the early rough times of a nation's life,
 unless it can fight well it has but a poor chance of living at
 all in the struggle going on around it. And we must also
 recollect that behind the fighting kings and earls of whom we
 hear, there were always the wise and gentle churchman and
 the sturdy hard-working yeoman, who go on with their work
 in silence, but whose labour is seen in the advances their
 country had made. A little knot of tribes colonizing a new
 land at the point of the sword has become a great nation,
 under the rule of a single king. Into this nation a second
 body of immigrants (the Danes) has been quietly absorbed.
 The whole island obeys the behests of the English king as
 Emperor of Britain; while by their belonging to the church
 system of Western Europe the English of this <quote>"Empire outside the world"</quote> have entered upon their career as a family
 of the European State-group, and taken a place in the
 world's history. Six centuries hardly seem too long for such
 progress as this.</p>

English nobles with him, and went to visit his own land, leaving England in charge of <persName key="Odo">Odo</persName>, his brother, and William  Fitz-Osbern, his friend. They began to oppress the English and to build castles all over the land, and as only the south-east of England was really in the king's own power, all those who had not yet felt his heavy hand rose against him. <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> Castle was attacked, <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> took up arms, and in the west Eadric the Wild (nephew of Eadric the Grasper) called in the Welsh. Messengers were also sent for help to Norway, Denmark, and Germany, and when the king came back the greater part of the country had to be conquered bit by bit: a task which, in spite of the folly and quarrels of the English leaders, took him four years to finish.</p>
  <p><placeName key="Wessex">Wessex</placeName> was completely overpowered by the fall of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, which <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>'s sons and their grandmother Gytha had long held against <persName key="William I.">William</persName>. <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName>'s sons indeed escaped to Ireland, and twice afterwards attempted to land in the west, but they were easily driven off.</p>
  <p>With the north the king had far more trouble. Eadgar
Etheling had fled with his sister Margaret and many English nobles to Scotland, where King <persName key="Bighead, Malcolm">Malcolm Bighead</persName> received them kindly, and made <persName key="Eadgar Etheling">Eadgar</persName> give him his sister to wife.
The Northumbrians, hoping for help from Scotland, chose
<persName key="Eadgar Etheling">Eadgar</persName> for king and rose in force. <persName key="William I.">William</persName> himself was forced to go north against them, drive the Etheling away, and, building castles in <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, garrison them with Norman soldiers to hold the province. But better help than <persName key="Eadgar Etheling">Eadgar</persName>'s was at hand. Swegen of Denmark sent his brother Asbeorn and his sons with 240 ships, who, coming into the Humber, were eagerly welcomed and joined by
Waltheof, son of Siward the Stout, and the other English earls. The French garrison at <placeName key="York">York</placeName> plundered the city and minster, and shut themselves up in the castle, but the Danes and English took it with great slaughter and drove the captive Normans as slaves to the ships. It was in these fights that Waltheof did the deeds that made him famous all over England. Once he kept a gate single-handed against a whole troop of Frenchmen, smiting down every one that came near him with his great axe. But when <persName key="William I.">William</persName> came up for the third time, the earls fled, the Danes took to their ships, and the people were left to their fate. <persName key="William I.">William</persName> determined to stop these northern risings for ever, and laid waste the whole land between the Humber and Tees, burning

 every cottage and slaying every living thing, so that for nine years not a yard of land was tilled in this awful desert.
Having thus set a barrier which the Scots could not easily cross, he held his Christmas at <placeName key="York">York</placeName> in state. The Danish fleet lay all the winter off the Humber, but were got rid of in the spring by being allowed to plunder the Golden Minster,
Peterborough, after which they agreed to leave the country.</p>
  <p>The Welsh border being still in arms, directly after Yule, in the depth of winter and the worst of weather, the king led his army across the wild hills to Chester, took it and stamped out the revolt, setting an earl as Constable to hold the city and keep the Welsh quiet.</p>
  <p>The last struggle came about in the east, where <persName key="Eadwine">Eadwine</persName> and <persName key="Morkere">Morkere</persName> turned traitors again, took to the woods, gathered hundreds of Englishmen to them, and set up a
Camp of Refuge at <placeName key="Ely">Ely</placeName> in the midst of the Fens. <persName key="Eadwine">Eadwine</persName> was murdered by his own men, but <persName key="Morkere">Morkere</persName> and Ethelwine
(one of the bishops whom <persName key="William I.">William</persName> had dethroned) and the famous <persName key="Hereward">Hereward</persName> held the island valiantly against <persName key="William I.">William</persName> and all his army, till the king built a causeway across the Fens, so that his men could assault the camp in force.
Then <persName key="Morkere">Morkere</persName> and the bishop surrendered, the former being pardoned for the sake of his brother <persName key="Eadwine">Eadwine</persName>, for whose fate <persName key="William I.">William</persName> (who only wept twice in his life) shed tears, though the handsome open-handed young earl had three times broken his oath to him. <persName key="Hereward">Hereward</persName> cut his way through the Normans and got away, and lived to be reconciled to the king, who admired his skill, and gave him part of his army to command in France in <date value ="1073">1073</date>. Many stories are told of <persName key="Hereward">Hereward</persName>'s adventures. He met his death at the hands of a band of Bretons led by Ralph of
Tewkesbury, who, being jealous of his favour with <persName key="William I.">William</persName> and the gifts he had given him, came upon the English captain and his faithful follower Winter unawares one day as they lay asleep in an orchard and slew them, not without a struggle, in which seventeen of the cowardly assailants were killed. <persName key="William I.">William</persName> was angry at this evil deed, and swore that if there had but been three other Englishmen as good as <persName key="Hereward">Hereward</persName>, the Normans would have been driven out of

 as <date value ="1070">1070</date> <persName key="William I.">William</persName> had set about the reform of
 the English Church, Ealdred was dead, Stigand
 and others were deposed, and seven vacant sees
 and many abbotships were filled at the Council
 of London by foreigners, mostly learned and pious men with
 the good of the Church at heart, but there were some
 among them whose zeal led them into cruelty towards their
 English flocks. Thus at <placeName key="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</placeName> Thurstan and his
 monks fell out over the new chants the abbot wished them
 to learn; they prayed him to treat them gently and promised
 obedience. But he threatened them all the more, and one
 day sent for soldiers to come full-weaponed into the chapter-
 house upon the poor monks, who fled frightened into the
 minster, locking the doors behind them. <quote>"But a rueful thing
 fell out that day! The Frenchmen broke into the choir and
 shot towards the altar where the monks were, and some
 of the knights went up into the gallery, and kept shooting
 downwards with arrows thence towards the sacrament, so
 that many arrows struck upon the rood that stood above the
 altar. And the wretched monks lay about the altar, and
 some crept under it, and called earnestly upon God, praying
 for mercy from Him, since they could get no mercy from
 men. What can we say? But that they kept on shooting,
 and the others broke the doors down and went in and slew
 some of the monks outright, and wounded many there in the
 chancel; so that the blood ran from the altar upon the steps,
 and from the steps on to the floor."</quote> Such men as Thurstan,
 who was removed by the king, did great harm, but the new
 archbishop, <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName>, was one of the best men that ever
 filled the See of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>. His career had been a strange
 one. Born at Pavia and bred to the law, having heard
 that good clerks could get on in Normandy, he came to
 Avranches and opened a school, to which his scholarship
 and eloquence soon assured great success. Suddenly he
 resolved to turn monk, and going to Bec, a little retreat set
 up by Herlwin, a pious Norman knight, took the cowl.
 Here <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName> learned much from the old soldier's simple
 piety, and showed the greatest humility and earnestness in
 his new calling. Once as he was reading at dinner according
 to rule to his fellow-monks, the ignorant prior wished him
 to say docere instead of docere as he rightly read it, and
 he complied without a word, telling his better-taught fellows
 afterwards that it was worse to disobey than make a false
 quantity. And to this sweet temper he owed his advancement. Arguing against <persName key="William I.">William</persName>'s marriage with his cousin

As he rode slowly away on a sorry hackney the monks had lent him he met the duke and all his train, and seeing that <persName key="William I.">William</persName> knew him, told him that if he had had a better steed he should have been out of his way hours ago. The duke laughed at his quiet humour, and told him to turn back with him. And when he saw the wisdom and learning of the monk, he took him into his service and treated him as a dear friend, paying great respect to his advice.</p>
  <p><persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName> did not like the way some of the English clergy mixed in government and lawsuits and worldly affairs, nor the gluttony and laziness of others, so he advised <persName key="William I.">William</persName> to let the Church have courts of its own, where all matters of church law and discipline might be dealt with by the clergy, instead of by all the people at the moots. He also forbade the clergy to attend or plead at any Lay Court. He moved the bishops' stools from places which had sunk into mere hamlets to towns where their influence might be of greater use. In many small matters too he brought the English
Church into conformity with the churches abroad. But neither he nor <persName key="William I.">William</persName> wished to put the Church wholly under the Pope, nor let it meddle with matters of State; and the king forbade any Pope to be acknowledged as such, or his bulls
(decrees) read, or any orders of the Church Assemblies to be enforced, or any layman to be punished by the Church without his leave, nor would he pay homage to the Pope.
<persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName> made collections of books for his library at Canterbury, and corrected many manuscripts with his own hand; he also wrote several pious and learned treatises.  Like
<persName key="William I.">William</persName>, he was fond of building, and by the help of his friend Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, the architect of the
White Tower and Rochester Cathedral, he rebuilt part of
<placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> Minster. One of <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName> s sayin s was that it was better for a man to spend his money on the poor than in, what was then thought most meritorious, going a pilgrimage.</p>

William Fitz-Osbern, his faithful friend, had fallen fighting for his wife's heritage in Flanders. His son Roger, an ambitious man, now set a plot on foot against the king on the marriage of his sister Emma to Ralf, Earl of Norfolk, at the wedding feast at Exning, to which he had bidden Earl Waltheof and many great men.

Here the two kinsmen spoke against <persName key="William I.">William</persName>; calling him base-born and no rightful ruler, cruel, unjust, and treacherous to his nobles; saying that he had rewarded the knights who won him his crown with the worst lands and kept the best himself; and proposing to oust him by the help of the
English (who, they said, would be glad to get revenge, though they seemed to think of little but eating and drinking), setting one of themselves in his place, while the other two should be dukes in the old way, as when <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName> ruled with his earls. Waltheof would not join them, though he promised secrecy; Ralf and Roger, however, gathered troops, hired Bretons from abroad, sent for help from Denmark, and raised their standards: but the English took arms against them, and the Norman garrisons were true to the king. Ralf fled over sea, leaving his bride to hold
<placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName>, which she did bravely, only surrendering on condition of the garrison being allowed to leave England unharmed; Roger was taken; Waltheof gave himself up, and the Bretons were made prisoners. The Danish fleet, 240 strong, came when all was over, and, not daring to meet
<persName key="William I.">William</persName>, made a hasty raid on <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, where they burned the minster (a deed which brought ill-luck on all that took part in it, and death to Earl Hakon's son, their leader), and sailed off to Flanders.

The innocent Waltheof was put to death next year, either through the lies of his wicked wife (Judith, the king's niece) or because <persName key="William I.">William</persName> was afraid of his popularity and influence in England, Scotland, and Denmark. Early on the morning of May 31 the young earl was led to a little hill near Winchester to die. He took off his rich robes and gave them to the poor, knelt down at the block and prayed earnestly, till the headsman, fearing a rescue, cut off his head while the words
<quote>"deliver us from evil !"</quote> were yet in his mouth. His body was buried at his beloved Abbey of Crowland, where miracles were wrought at his tomb, as the English believed, and it was said that none of <persName key="William I.">William</persName>'s plans ever prospered after the Martyr-Earl's death.  A Norwegian poet who had known Waltheof says in his dirge on him-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Yea, he that, sailing northward, clove the cold sea, and blood-red</l>

Normans, and defeated <persName key="William I.">William</persName> for the first time at Dol, taking his camp and treasure, and obliging him to accept their terms of peace, a worse disaster followed. Robert Curthose, <persName key="William I.">William</persName>'s eldest son, a brave young man, but ill-advised, asked for the heritage, Normandy and Maine, which his father had promised him. <q type="spoken">" I do not take off my clothes before I go to bed,"</q> said the king, and refused him.  Whereupon, getting the help of King Philip and those Norman barons who disliked
<persName key="William I.">William</persName>'s just rule and longed for the licence the lazy good-nature of Robert would allow them, the headstrong young man took up arms. At Gerberoi (<date value ="1079">1079</date>) he met his father in battle, and, not knowing who he was, wounded him in the hand. The king's horse was shot under him, and but for a brave Englishman, Tostig, who fell struck through by an arblast bolt as he brought him another charger, he would most likely have been killed.  When Robert heard his father's voice and knew him, he dismounted, threw himself at his feet, and begged his forgiveness. A peace was patched up, and Robert came to England, where he built Newcastle for his father as a Border fortress against the Scots in <date value ="1080">1080</date>.</p>
  <p><persName key="William I.">William</persName>'s glorious progress through South Wales to S.

Matilda, a good, pious woman, whose foolish fondness for the misguided Robert was her only fault. He was obliged to imprison his brother <persName key="Odo">Odo</persName>, who had ruled badly and greedily, and was now gathering an army to go to Rome to try and be made Pope, having spent vast sums in bribing the Roman people.   Moreover, the Danes were again threatening England, <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName>, their king, had married a daughter of William Fitz-Osbern's foe, now Earl of Flanders, and in alliance with him and the King of Norway, had gathered a fleet to conquer England. <persName key="William I.">William</persName> was obliged to summon soldiers from abroad, <quote>" so many that men wondered how the land might feed them all,"</quote> quarter them on the English, and raise Danegild to pay them.

 or shelter or landing. <persName key="Cnut">Cnut</persName>, however, was slain by his own men, so that his plans came to nought. But <persName key="William I.">William</persName>, wishing to find out exactly the resources of his kingdom, so that it might be defended in the least burdensome way if ever there were danger again, <quote>"took great thought, and held deep speech with his Wise Men"</quote> at Gloster, <date value ="1085">1085</date>; and being advised to make a survey of the whole country, sent commissioners into every shire to find out how much land of every sort there was, how many landholders, cottars, and slaves, and what was the worth of the land and cattle in every manor. Inquest was held in every village and evidence taken on oath; <quote>"so narrowly did he make them seek out all this, that there was not a single hyde or yard of land
(shameful it is to tell, though he thought it no shame to do), nor one ox, nor one cow, nor one swine left out, that was not set down in his rolls, and all these rolls were afterwards brought to him."</quote> From them was made the great Domesday Book, which tells us more of the history, state, and condition of England than can be known of any other country for hundreds of years afterwards, and gives us cause to bless
<persName key="William I.">William</persName>'s wisdom rather than blame his greed.</p>
  <p>With the results of this great Inquest before him, <persName key="William I.">William</persName> summoned all the landholders of England, mediate and immediate (whether holding of other lords or directly of him), to meet him at Sarum, where he made them swear, according to the old English custom, to be faithful to him, for he did not wish the Norman ideas, that a man was only bound to be faithful to him whose tenant he was, disregarding the overlord's rights altogether, to grow up in England. It was also a sign that he would uphold the free English customs and moots, and not suffer the lords' power to override them.
The distress caused by the heavy taxes, bad harvests and consequent famines, and several great fires (in one of which
S. Paul's in London was burned), besides the heavy rule of the Norman landlords, all made Englishmen believe that their sins had brought God's heavy wrath upon them.</p>

 raging against the French king for a coarse

 the last time, and marching to Mantes, a frontier town, burned it, minsters and all. As he rode round the
 flaming city, his horse reared and threw him against the
 pommel of his saddle, giving him a hurt of which he died on
 Tuesday, September 9, <date value ="1087">1087</date>. On his deathbed he called
 his sons to him and told them the whole story of his life.
 <q type="spoken">"I have never hurt God's Church, but I am stained with


<pb id="p.69" n="69"/>


 rivers of blood,"</q> he said, and prayed them all to pay heed to his mistakes and sins and rule uprightly. Then leaving
Normandy and Maine to Robert, his first-born, prophesying ill-luck for him, he said, <q type="spoken">"Having made my way to the
English throne by so many evil deeds, I dare not leave it to any one but God, by whose will I trust that my son <persName key="William II.">William</persName>, who hath ever been good son to me, may be king after me and reign gloriously."</q> To Henry he gave  &#x00A3; 5000, bidding him trust in the Lord, for that in the end he should have all his father ever held. Then he forgave all his enemies, set free all his prisoners of state, and commended his soul to the Lord Jesus with his last breath as the morning bell rang out from the steeple of Rouen Minster. Thence they bore him to his own abbey at C&#x00E6;n, where, but in little state, and not till the knight from whom he had seized the land for his foundation had been paid for the grave, he was laid.</p>
  <p>One who knew him well says of this great king that he was mightier and wiser than any of his forerunners; a pious man that built many minsters and loved God's servants; so stern a man that he would not spare his own brother if he did wrong; so just that the good peace he made cannot be forgotten; and so mighty that he held Normandy and Brittany, won England and Maine, made Scotland and Wales bow to him, and would, had he lived two years longer, have won Ireland by his mere renown, without need of weapon.
But he was also greedy of gold, proud and hard-hearted, as when he made the Great Deer-parks, <quote>"and ordered that whoso slew hart or hind, him men should blind, and forbade men to slay deer or bear, and made the hare go free, for he loved the big game as if he were their father,"</quote> recking nought of the poor that he oppressed. In person <persName key="William I.">William</persName> was tall and stout, skilled in horsemanship, and so strong that no man could bend his bow. His face was handsome, but stern-looking; he had an aquiline nose, quick grey eyes, a high brow, and dark hair, but became bald in middle age.
A man of few words, but able to speak well; passionate, but never losing his head; crafty, but true to his pledged word; a far-sighted statesman, a skilful general, and a just judge, no king of England was better gifted for the hard evil days in which his rule was cast.</p>

(amongst whom were Earl <persName key="Morkere">Morkere</persName> and Wulfnoth, <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName>'s youngest son, who had been the Conqueror's hostage and captive many years) and dealing out the great hoard at
<placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> for the good of the dead king's soul; to every minster in England six or ten gold marks, to every church sixty pence, and to every shire &#x00A3;100 for the poor. Still the
Norman barons, ill-content with a strong king, plotted in favour of Robert, who would leave all power in their hands.
But <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName> stood by <persName key="William II.">William</persName>, sent for the chief Englishmen, told them of the king's need, and promised them on his behalf <quote>" the best laws that ever were in the land,"</quote> the strict punishment of all evil-doers, and the woods and hunting-rights which the Conqueror had taken away. Accordingly the faithful English levies met, drove off Robert when he tried to land, and put down the rebellion, <persName key="Odo">Odo</persName> and many others being banished and their lands given to better men. But
<persName key="William II.">William</persName> soon forgot his promises, and when <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName>, <quote>"the father and friend of the monks and all good men,"</quote> was dead, he began to vex his people with heavy taxes and make them labour at his buildings, the Tower Wall, London Bridge, and the Great Hall at Westminster. His new Justiciar was
<persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName>, nicknamed the Torch, who had served on the Domesday Commission, a rough, burly, coarse man, but eager to please the king, and clever enough to cover all his ill-doing with the cloak of law. It is owing to him that the English system of landholding became harder, stricter, and more burdensome than before the Conquest.</p>
   <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2"><persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName></note>By <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName>'s counsel, also, the king refused to put fresh
 bishops and abbots in the place of those that died, keeping
 their lands meanwhile for his own profit, starving the Church
 and the poor. This went on till <date value ="1093">1093</date>, when he fell ill, and,
 his heart misgiving him at the point of death, vowed to make
 amends to his people and the Church. <persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName>,
 Abbot of Bec, who happened to be staying in
 England founding a minster for the Earl of Chester, was
 sent for to his bedside and given the archbishopric of
 <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>; he refused, being afraid, as he said, that the
 plough of the Church, which had been drawn by two strong
 oxen (<persName key="William II.">William</persName> and <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName>), would go hardly if a poor weak


<pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

 sheep were yoked to a wild bull (himself and the king); but the bishops who stood by forced the staff into his hand, and carried him off to the Cathedral to be installed whether he willed or no, to the great joy of all that heard of it.</p>
   <p>For <persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName> was truly a great man. So good that he was
 held a saint in his very lifetime, so meek that even his
 enemies honoured him, so wise that he was the foremost
 thinker of his day and the forerunner of the greatest philosophers of ours. Born about <date value ="1033">1033</date> near Aosta of a pious
 mother, he was even in his childhood always thinking and
 dreaming of holy things, and would have become a monk at
 fifteen but for his father's opposal. When he was full grown
 he turned, like <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName>, to Normandy and took the cowl at
 Bec, where he won all hearts, overcoming the illwill of one
 jealous brother in particular by his long-suffering till he
 made him his greatest friend. At last he was chosen abbot,
 but the good monks were sometimes in straits under his rule,
 for he would give everything to the poor, so that now and
 then they had to forego their own dinner as the larder was
 empty. However, they loved him so much that some of
 them wished to refuse him leave to take the archbishopric
 and call him back among them.</p>
 <p>As he had foreseen, troubles came; he wished the king to
 acknowledge Urban as lawful Pope, but now that <persName key="William II.">William</persName>
 was healed he fell back into his old ways and evil life, and
 though after much trouble he gave way on this point, he
 stood out on all the rest, and when <persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName> in sheer despair
 resolved to go to Rome, refused him leave till <date value ="1097">1097</date>. Then
 the two met for the last time; <persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName> forgave him, blessed
 him, and started to lay all his troubles before the Pope.
 Urban received him gladly, and paid him great honour,
 making him speak for him at a great council of bishops
 which was then being held, still he would not interfere with the
 king on his behalf. So with a heavy heart the archbishop
 left him and went to the north of France, whence he travelled
 south, staying abroad till the Red King's death.</p>

  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="5">Wars in Wales.</note>Robert's pledge made <persName key="William II.">William</persName> the greatest king in
Europe. He held the best parts of France, and having the rents from many forfeited estates and vacant church lands, was even richer than his father. Only in Wales there was still war, for though South Wales had been won already by Norman adventurers bit by bit, the
North Welsh made a stout resistance, while their border was being slowly driven in, castle after castle rising upon the newly-won lands.</p>
  <p>The Earl of Chester, Hugh the Fat, and Hugh the Proud of Shrewsbury, were the bitterest foes the Welsh had, and would have taken the whole coast of North Wales and even
Anglesey, but for Magnus Bareleg, King of Norway, who sailed into the Menai Straits as the two border earls were engaged in subduing the island. They drew up their men to prevent the Northmen landing, when the king ran his ships close to the shore and there was a sharp fight. <quote>"Hugh the Proud was on horseback in the water in front of his men. He was covered all over in mail so that save his eyes there was not a bare spot on him.  King Magnus and a Fin that stood by him on the quarterdeck of his ship both shot at the earl at the same time.  One arrow hit the nosepiece of the helmet so hard that it bent on one side, but the other struck
Hugh's eye and pierced through his head so that the point stood out at the nape of his neck, and men saw that that arrow was the king's."</quote> As a northern poet sang-

Our lord his elm bow draws: the blood spirts on the helmet,
The bowstrings' war-hail [arrows] smote upon the rings; before it
The foe quailed. In sharp onslaught the Norse king slew the earl."</quote>
Magnus shouted mockingly as the earl fell forward into the sea, <quote>"Let him dive if he will!"</quote> and the leaderless Englishmen left the shore. So making truce with Hugh the Fat, the king won Anglesey, gave it to Owen, <persName key="Eadmund Ironside">Eadmund Ironside</persName>'s

  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="6"><persName key="William II.">William</persName>'s death and character. </note>On Thursday,
August 2, <date value ="1100">1100</date>, he was at a hunting-lodge in the New Forest with his brother <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName>, a French knight named Walter Tirel, whose skill in archery had made him a favourite, and a few other courtiers. Before they started for the day's sport two men came to him. One a fletcher [arrow-maker] with a gift of six finely-made arrows, which the king gladly took, thanking the giver, and handing two to Walter with the words, <quote>" I know thou wilt make the best use of them."</quote> The second bore a letter from Serlo, Abbot of Gloucester, telling him of a dreadful dream one of his monks, <persName key="William II.">William</persName> by name, had had concerning him.  He thought he was in the abbey church, and that he saw a beautiful lady clothed in white glistening raiment come in and cast herself before the Rood, praying very earnestly to the Lord to have mercy upon her and overthrow her enemy. Whereon he seemed to see the image on the Rood bow its head towards her and answer, <quote>" Be patient, and within a little space thou shalt surely be avenged."</quote>
Awaking in great terror he told his vision to Serlo, who seeing
 that the White Lady prefigured the Church, and fearful that the anger of the Lord was kindled against the king, made haste to write him the dream and the interpretation thereof, earnestly beseeching him to repent. But though
<persName key="William II.">William</persName> himself had been specially warned not to go hunting that day, he laughed at the letter. "<quote>Serlo is a good man and wishes me well, but he must be doting to send me the dreams of his snoring monks. Am I, an Englishman, to be stopped in what I am about by an old wife's whims?"</quote> and went forth. When the driving began the king and Tirel alighted, and were posted near one another in a ride with no one else by. A great grizzled hart came bounding towards them; <persName key="William II.">William</persName> shot at it, and missing called out to Tirel,
<quote>"Shoot, Walter! shoot in the devil's name!"</quote> The knight drew his bow, the arrow grazed the beast as it ran between them, and glancing, struck the king to the heart. Walter saw him fall and fled, and <persName key="William II.">William</persName> lay there till sunset, when they

  <p>One of his English subjects says of him, <quote>" He was mighty and terrible over his land, and his men, and towards all his neighbours. All that was loathsome in the eyes of God and righteous men was of common use in his time; wherefore he was loathed by wellnigh all his people, and hateful to God as his end showed."</quote> But it cannot be gainsaid that he was a faithful son, a kind master, and a brave knight, and though passionate and foul-tongued, able to boast with truth that he never did in anger what he would not have done in cold blood. He was utterly fearless, and too proud to be cruel.
Once when he was embarking for Normandy, and the ship-master was afraid to weigh anchor in the gale that was blowing, he bid him, <quote>' Set sail! I never heard of a king being drowned."</quote> One of his prisoners telling him in a rage that he would defy his power if he were but free again, he loosed him and told him to go and do his worst. If he had but had his father's sense of duty, he would not have fallen short of his fame. In person he was stout, strong, and big-limbed, with light hair and a red face (whence his nick-name, Red Dragon), and keen, restless, grey-spotted eyes, under a broad high brow standing out in four bosses as it were. His voice was loud, and he stammered, especially when he was angry.</p>

The court was set in order, and the king's Counting-House or Exchequer better officered and worked than before. But the English were chiefly pleased with the king's marriage to Eadgyth or Maud, the daughter of Malcolm and Margaret of Scotland, and therefore a princess of the old West Saxon line.  The Norman lords, who had despised <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> in his youth, but had been outwitted by his readiness in seizing the throne, now hated him and <soCalled>"his English ways,"</soCalled> and when Robert came back they determined to make him king by force. Their leaders were Robert of Belesme, a powerful and crafty man, who used his great talents merely to further his monstrous cruelty and wickedness; Ivo of Grantmesnil (who boasted that he was the first man in England that ever dared to proclaim war on a neighbour), a cunning soldier, but a coward as he showed when he fled from the Crusade, letting himself down from the walls of Antioch in a basket, for which he got the name of Rope-dancer; and <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> Torch, who escaped from the Tower by making his jailers drunk and climbing the walls by a cord smuggled in to him in a wine-jar. The duke's claims were bought off for 3000 marks a year and a renewal of <persName key="William II.">William</persName>'s old agreement; Ivo was outlawed; but Robert of Belesme defied the king, till the English levies took his castles one by one, when he surrendered and was allowed to leave the realm. The English rejoiced at the fall of the most loathed of the barons and sung:-
      <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Make merry, King <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName>, and thank the Almighty!</l>
      <l>For your reign in good earnest begins from the day</l>
      <l>When you beat down and overcame Robert of Belesme,</l>

<note place="foot" n="4">The White Ship.</note>England. As they were embarking at Honfleur, Thomas, son of Stephen, who had been captain of <persName key="William I.">William</persName> the
Conqueror's ship Mora, prayed the king to take his White Ship. He would not, but the Etheling William, willing to please Thomas, promised to sail with him, and went on board with his sister the Countess of Perche and a great company of gentlemen and ladies and the king's treasure. Before they started the sailors asked the prince for wine, and were given three barrels, which they drank at once, becoming so unruly that several passengers went on shore rather than sail with them, and so riotous that they drove off the priests who came down to bless the vessel with abuse and blasphemy. At last, late on the evening of November 25, they put off with a fair wind and calm sea, but no watch was kept, and the helmsman paid little heed to his course in the midst of the revelry. Suddenly the ship struck on the Reef of Catteville, about five miles from land, staving in her starboard bow. Amid great confusion they tried to get her off with poles and oars, but when they found how badly she was damaged, a boat was got out and the Etheling put in her with as many as she would hold. He had rowed clear of the wreck when, finding that his sister was left behind, he put back to save her. By this time the White Ship was filling fast, and when the boat lay alongside, she was swamped by the rush of panic-stricken people from the wreck. In a few minutes the wreck also sunk, and of the whole company of three hundred souls only three were left alive, clinging to the top-castle of the vessel, which was just above water. One was the captain, Thomas, who, when he found that the
Etheling was drowned, threw himself into the sea in despair.
The second, a young noble, could not endure the cold of the long November night; and when some fishermen passed next morning at dawn, they found only the third, Berold, a poor butcher of Rouen, who was saved by the warmth of his rough sheepskin jacket. No one dared take <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> the sad news, so a little child was sent into the hall where he was sitting. The boy went up to the king crying bitterly, and cast himself down at his feet, and when <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> raised him up and asked him why he wept he told him that the White
Ship had sunk with all on board. The king fell fainting from his seat, and henceforward the joy was gone out of his life; it is said that he never smiled again, and though he would sometimes speak of Ralph the Red, and other of his good knights and friends that had perished in the wreck, he could never bear to hear his son's name. The king's treasure

Scotland was a more serious danger. With two hundred knights, a host of footmen, and many wild Galwegians, he pillaged the land, killing all the men, carrying off the women and children as slaves, and burning the houses. Thurstan, the aged Archbishop of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, called out the levies of the northern shires, and they met the Scots at Allerton Moor. In their midst was a cart with a tall mast fixed on it bearing the king's standard and the banners of the saints of the north, S. John of Beverley, S. Wilfred of Ripon, and S. Peter, and the sacrament in a casket.
Round this were arrayed the mail-clad English knights on foot after the old fashion with sword and lance, and the yeomen with bows and axes. The Scottish king wished his mounted knights to charge them, but the Galloway-men clamoured for the honour of beginning the fight, their earl boasting that though he wore no mail he would fight as far forward as any steel-clad knight of them all. Stripped to the waist, armed only with sword and buckler, the Gallowaymen rushed upon the English shouting their war-cry, Alban !
Alban ! [Scotland !] but a deadly shower of arrows from the yeomen broke their ranks before they reached the firm line of knights, who, advancing on their unsteady enemies, swept them before them <quote>"like a spider's web."</quote> David's son made a gallant charge with his knights, but the main body of the
Scots were too disordered to rally, and soon took to flight.
The pursuit was hot, for the English had fearful wrongs to revenge; ten thousand Galwegians were killed, and only nineteen of all the Scots knights escaped death or captivity. David was glad to make peace. This battle of the

 nor drink till they opened their gates to the king. He was then released, but he never got over the sudden fall from his high estate, and soon after died of a broken heart. Henry of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> was furious that a bishop should have been so badly used, and calling a council of clergy at Windsor, he laid the case before them, showing his appointment as legate or lieutenant for the Pope in England, and begging them to pay no heed to his own kinship with the king, but only to do justice. The king thereupon forbade them to proceed further, and they broke up in fear of him. But within a month the Empress Maud and her half-brother the Earl of
Gloster landed in England, and sure of the support of the clergy, who had angrily turned from the king they had chosen, and of all who disliked <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName> or hoped for <quote>"the unholy gains of civil strife,"</quote> began the war; while <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s mercenaries were nothing loath to fight in such a rich country.</p>
  <p>The Monk of Peterborough, who wrote the last piece of the <hi rend="italics">Old English Chronicle</hi>, says of the English lords: <quote>"They forswore themselves and broke their troth, for every nobleman made him a castle and held it against the king, and filled the land full of castles. They put the wretched countryfolk to sore toil with their castle-building, and when the castles were made they filled them with devils and evil men.
Then they took all those that they deemed had any goods, both by night and by day, men and women alike, and put them in prison to get their gold and silver, and tortured them with tortures unspeakable, for never were martyrs so tortured as they were."</quote> <quote>" Many thousand they slew with hunger. I cannot nor may not tell all the horrors and all the tortures that they laid on wretched men in this land. And this lasted nineteen winters while <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName> was king, and ever it was worse and worse. They laid taxes on the villages continually, calling it tenserie, and when the wretched folk had no more to give them, they robbed and burned all the villages, so that thou mightest easily fare a whole day's journey and shouldest never find a man living in a village nor land tilled.
Then was corn dear, and flesh, and cheese, for there was none in the land. Wretched men starved for hunger, and some went begging alms that were once rich men, and some fled out of the land."</quote></p>
   <p>And of the king's hired soldiers he says: <quote>" There was never
 yet more wretchedness in the land, nor did ever heathen
 men worse than they did, for they neither forbore church
 nor churchyard, but took all the goods that were therein, and
 then burned the church and all together. Nor did they forbear

 bishop's land, or abbot's, or priest's, but robbed monks and clerks and every other man they could. If two men or three came riding to a village, all the village-folk fled before them, deeming them to be robbers. The bishops and clergy were ever cursing them, but they cared nought therefor, for they were all forcursed and forsworn, and forlorn.
Wheresoever men tilled, the earth bore no corn, for the land was all fordone with such deeds, and they [the wicked] said openly that Christ and His saints slept. Such, and more than we can say, we suffered nineteen winters for our sins!"</quote></p>
  <p>4. Only the main story of the war need be told. The great barons of the west and north fought for the empress, while <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s greatest strength lay in London and the other big towns of the east and south, and among the yeomen of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> and Norfolk, the richest and most civilized parts of
England. By the help, however, of Robert of Gloster, her half-brother, whose heart and head were worthy of a better cause, and of Randolf, Earl of Chester, a bold and crafty man, Robert's son-in-law, <placeName key="Matilda">Matilda</placeName>'s party gained ground.<note place="foot" n="1"> Battle of Lincoln, and routs of London and <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>.</note>

The king resolved to fight them, though they far outnumbered his forces. His hired soldiers were soon put to flight by the two earls, but <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName> himself would neither fly nor yield.  He stood on foot, hemmed round by foes, only three faithful guardsmen staying by him, till his, sword-blade snapped, when a <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> man handed him a Danish axe, with which he fought, beating off Randolf of Chester, who attacked him, and striking down every man that came near him, until the axe-helve broke in his hand. Still no one dared lay hands on him till he was felled to the ground by a great stone, when William de Kaims sprang forward and seized him by the helmet, crying, <quote>"Here! here! I have got the king,"</quote> whereupon he yielded himself prisoner. He was then put in ward at Bristol, and a great council being called at <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, Henry of Blois proposed to choose <placeName key="Matilda">Matilda</placeName> as queen, and to this, in spite of the protest of <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s queen, Maud of Boulogne, and the Londoners, who, as <quote>"almost barons of the realm,"</quote> were of course present, the meeting agreed. The clergy then excommunicated all of <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s party who should not lay down their arms at once, and the empress went to London to be crowned. But her haughty behaviour disgusted her best friends; she would listen to no man's advice, despising

 even the counsels of her uncle David, who had again marched into England to help her; she refused to let
<persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s kinsmen have their rights, took back the grants he had made to the Church, and fining the Londoners heavily, denied them the Law of King <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName>, which her father had promised them for ever. The end of all this was that one day as she was sitting down to dinner the city bells rang the alarm, and the Londoners swarmed out sword in hand like angry wasps from their comb, resolved to take her prisoner and slay her followers. She had only time to fly on a swift steed, leaving all her jewels, dress, and plate behind her, to <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>. The Londoners now sent for
<persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s queen, swore to be true to her, and sent a thousand mail-clad men under the city banner, the standard of

The empress beleaguered his castle with a great host, in which were the King of Scots, eight great earls, and many barons. <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s queen, however, after several skirmishes, obliged the empress to retreat, and attacking her army as it left the town, threw it into a panic, and turned the retreat to a rout. The country-folk rose upon the flying barons, while the Londoners sacked <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> and gained great spoil. The King of Scots and Earl Robert were taken. The empress fled on horseback to Devizes, whence, fearing the people, her followers having covered her with grave-clothes bore her on a bier to Gloucester.

                    <head>CHAPTER V:England under the Norman Kings</head>

        
 <p>1. Under the Norman kings there were many changes in
 England. Almost the whole generation of English noblemen and gentry had been swept away, and their places filled
 by a foreign king, his kinsmen, and soldiers, who, though
 they did not pretend to have greater right or power than
 those they had succeeded, yet naturally took advantage of their position to get the most they could out of their tenants and serfs. We hear of heavy exactions, forced labour under



<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>
<note type="header"  place="head">[<dateRange from="1066" to="1154">1066-1154</dateRange>.</note>
 colour of law, of villages laid waste to enlarge the king's hunting-grounds, and town parishes destroyed to make way for the nobles' castles. <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> Torch compelled all who held land of the king as thegens (barons and knights they were now called) to find a man to serve forty days in the royal army, fully armed and horsed at their expense, for every knight's fee (piece of land worth &#x00A3;20 per year) they held.
He also exacted reliefs (a year's rent) from incoming tenants and heirs, and gave the lord full power over his infant tenant's land till he came of age, and the right of marrying heiresses and widows to whom he would. If the lord made his son a knight, or gave his eldest daughter in marriage, or was captured in war, he looked to his tenants for aids or contributions to help him to defray his expenses or his ransom. The barons of course enforced the same services upon their military tenants as the king enforced upon them.
<note place="foot" n="1">Changes at the Conquest.</note>Other free-tenants, socmen or franklins, were obliged to pay some fixed rent in kind or money and to attend the lord's court, while the villeins or tenants at the lord's will were almost entirely at his mercy, and were obliged to labour on his land and buildings whenever he chose to call for their services. But in all these cases the change lay rather in the greater strictness and regularity of the new lords than the rise of new customs or the breach of old rights. There were few new laws made, except about the forests, any man who hunted in the king's woods without permission (and all the untilled folk-land was now become royal forest) might be tried and condemned to lose his hands or feet or eyes. <persName key="Henry I.">Henry I.</persName> even ordered that all dogs whose feet were too big to pass through a ring kept by the foresters should have two of the toes of its forefeet cut off, that it might not be able to run down deer, though still useful for droving. These laws were hated, and many Englishmen took to the woods, living as poachers, defying the king's keepers, and robbing the rich passengers, especially foreigners, who passed their haunts, so that people living near a forest were obliged to fortify their houses for fear of these brigands. <persName key="William I.">The Conqueror</persName>, after the old English custom, put no man to death for law-breaking, but punished by outlawry, fine, or mutilation; however, his son <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> found the need of sterner measures, and began hanging men for theft and other felonies (bad crimes) or treasons. We hear of two customs at this time which, whether brought in by the Normans or the Danes, became part of
English law. One was wager of battle, the right of the accused to prove his innocence by single combat with his

 accuser or his champion, instead of by compurgation or ordeal if he preferred it. The other was the inquest, a mode of getting knowledge of the facts of any disputed case by swearing a jury of twelve men of the neighbourhood to declare what they knew of the subject. It was from the verdict or report of such inquests that Domesday Book was put together.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The royal officers and Curia Regis.</note>The crown was much stronger than before the Conquest, the officers of the royal household had more to do, and the central government became powerful and important. The justiciar had to see that justice was given to all who asked it; the chancellor issued royal grants, writs (orders to sheriffs to summon juries, arrest prisoners, execute justice, etc.), and warrants; the treasurer sat at the king's counting-house, or
Exchequer as it was now called (because of the chessboard-like cloth on which they reckoned the money), where <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName>'s friend <persName key="Roger of Salisbury">Roger <title>Bishop of <placeName key="Salisbury">Salisbury</placeName></title></persName> set up a regular system of keeping and paying accounts, and devised a plan of sending commissioners round to the counties to settle disputes about the revenue in full county court. To the Exchequer, too, every year the sheriffs came to pay the feorm or rent of the county and the fines into the treasury, receiving their quietus, or certificate of payment. Tallies, little slips of wood notched on the edges with different marks according to the value they represented, were split in two, and (each party keeping half) served as check and counterfoil when any money was paid out of the royal treasury. Beside these great offices often held by churchmen, the great nobles did not now disdain to hold places in the household as dispenser (steward), butler, chamberlain, or to serve the king as marshal or constable of his host; these places (all held by laymen) soon became hereditary. The king's household, Curia Regis, served him as a kind of Ministry, and followed him on his journeys. There were still Councils of the Wise Men, and often Great Moots, Magna Concilia, to which every one who held land of the king might come. Several new earldoms were made. Two in especial, Chester and Shrewsbury, with palatine rights (power to hold courts and to issue writs in the earl's name), to be the better able to defend the Welsh border, were created by <persName key="William I.">William</persName>, and others by his successors.</p>
   <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">Power and reforms of the Church.</note>In spite of the difficulties of the problem, <persName key="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</persName>'s
 policy had been successful: the Church of
 England was far stronger than before. The
 king found it his best friend as long as he ruled
 well, while the people looked to it alone for help against the



<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>

 lawlessness of the barons or the heavy hands of the king's officers. <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> made two new sees, <placeName key="Ely">Ely</placeName> and <placeName key="Carlisle">Carlisle</placeName>, and gave these bishops palatine rights for defence against Danes and Scots. Many abbeys were founded by the great barons, and when the strict Cistercian rule was brought to England by Stephen Harding and his fellows, the monasteries of its followers soon sprung up " in the desert places " of the Welsh hills and <placeName key="York">York</placeName>shire wolds. The reforming synods of Lanfranc and <persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName>, and the new bishops' courts, did much to raise the character of the parish clergy; their decrees against the marriage of priests were, however, still evaded by the payment of a yearly tax to the king. The increasing wealth and zeal of the Church was marked by the stately cathedrals which were fast replacing the smaller and less splendid
English minsters, just as the high stone wall (ballium) and huge square keep (central tower) were everywhere supplanting the paled foss of earth and stockaded mound of earlier days.
The fashion for building great churches and stone castles had indeed begun before the Conquest, as <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward</persName> the
Confessor's Westminster bears witness; but the finest examples of the Roman round-arch style of building, sacred or secular-such as Durham Minster, begun by William of S.
Calais and finished by <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> Torch; the Gate Tower at
Bury; <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName> Minster, built by Herbert Losinge; Carisbrooke Keep; Tintagel Hold, Gundulfs White Tower, and
William of Corbeil's Keep at Rochester-date from the Norman kings' reign.</p>
  <p>4. The English tongue was less changed by the Norman than the Danish Conquest. Charters and deeds were still in
Old English or Latin. French was indeed spoken at court, and Latin in the cloister, and a few words found their way into the speech of the people, but the chief effect of the disuse of English by the upper classes was to hasten and deepen the changes already going on in our tongue (as noticed above), and to give rise to the well-marked dialects in which all Middle English was written and spoken.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="4">Language and letters.</note>There were few writers in such hard and restless days; but we must notice the two nameless Peterborough monks who close t<hi rend="italics">he English Chronicle</hi>; William the elders chaplain, William of Poitiers, who wrote of the
Norman Conquest; Orderic of S. Evroult, an English monk who lived in Normandy and wrote a most minute and pathetic account of his own life and times;  William of Malmesbury, who wrote for Robert of Gloster the most scientific of our
Latin histories; and Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon, an outspoken critic who loved old ballads and stories.</p>


<pb id="p.89" n="89"/>

  <p>But perhaps the most interesting historical work of this time is the Bayeux Tapestry, a strip of white linen (214 by 1 and 2/3 feet) on which are wrought in coloured worsteds a series of pictures of the various acts of the Norman Conquest. It was worked by English women for <persName key="Odo">Odo</persName>'s church, and recalls the tapestry on which, a century earlier, Byrhtnoth's widow had worked the great deeds of her husband's life as a gift to Ely. That precious relic is lost, but the Bayeux needle-pictures are still unfaded and sound.</p>
  <p>S&#x00E6;wulf the monk's account of his pilgrimage in Palestine is worth reading. There are also a few sermons and satires which show something of the life of the time. At court the favourite poems were the epics of Charlemagne and his peers, the most beautiful of which, <hi rend="italics">The Death of Roland,</hi> was very likely composed in England by a Norman, Turold
(perhaps the Turoldus who figures in the Tapestry), in William the elder's reign. The story of Luc de Barre, who was sentenced to be blinded by <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> I. for the satires he had composed on him, show that the Provencal poetry was known and admired in the north. Although there were as yet no universities, we hear of lectures on Divinity and Roman Law being delivered in <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> in <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> and <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s days.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="5">Habits and customs.</note>The Norman nobles brought in many new fashions of dress, and in <persName key="William II.">William the Red</persName>'s time we hear of short tunics embroidered with gold and jewels, long curly-toed Angevin shoes, rich silk scarlet mantles, and much other extravagance of attire among men and women.
The fashion for the upper classes at the Conquest in both nations was to clip the hair and shave the face, leaving only mustaches.  Young men, however, wore long hair in
England, and this custom was taken up by the Normans, and vehemently attacked by the clergy, who looked upon it as womanish and vain. Women's dress remained unaltered. The Normans brought from France many new ways of dressing food, and were careful cooks, despising the gross food and drunkenness of the English. English men and women began to take the favourite French names Matilda,
Alice, William, Robert, Henry, Thomas, and the like, and drop their old English and Danish ones.</p>
  <p>Many rich foreigners came and settled in the English towns, Jews, Germans, Easterlings (Hansetown folk), and
Normans.  Craft-gilds (trade-clubs among all those of a craft) began to be formed in many cities, as they recovered from the destruction of the first years of conquest. London grew larger and bought fresh rights of <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> I. (the management

 of Middlesex by a sheriff chosen by themselves, and the fixing of the city-rent), and got their old ones confirmed.
The constant intercourse with Normandy and the foreign connections of the Norman kings led to men travelling more and trading more widely. Thus we hear of Paul, Earl of
Orkney, sending beasts to <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName>'s menagerie at Woodstock, and of King Sigurd of Norway stopping a winter with him on his way to the Crusades, while the foreign marriages, the visits of the Scots king to England, the embassies from Pope and
Emperor, and the constant connection with France in peace or war all show that England was now taking a regular part in European politics and life.</p>
  <p>The population of England about <date value ="1100">1100</date> was made up of
9500 military and church tenants; 35,000 yeomen holders
(all north of Watling Street or in <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>); 90,000 cottars and bordars (the same class south of Watling Street sunk into the lords' power); 109,000 villeins (freedmen holding land at lord's will); 25,000 serfs (the absolute slaves of their owners) with their families. The remainder, unaccounted for in
Domesday, was made up of burgesses (citizen householders) priests, monks, nuns, etc.: in all, about 300,000 families, or about two million souls. Wars, famines, and sickness prevented the population growing fast.</p>

He had great natural gifts, was of an energetic and persevering character, and an iron constitution, while he had set his heart on seeing his domains
 peaceful and prosperous.  Directly he was crowned, December 19, <date value ="1154">1154</date>, he published a charter, and began carrying out the articles of the Wallingford treaty.
The Flemings were sent home to their workshops, or ordered to join their brethren in Wales, the royal farms were restocked, <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s foolish grants of land and money annulled, and the great barons of both parties compelled to give up their castles. The rule of law began again; <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> chose
Robert, Earl of Leicester, for his Justiciar, and <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>
<persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> for Chancellor, appointed fresh judges for his royal court, and put forth a new order allowing disputed criminal cases or suits touching the ownership of land to be decided before a king's judge by inquest [inquiry] of twelve sworn neighbours, freeholders of the shire, instead of ordeal or wager of battle.</p>
<p>After defeating his brother Geoffrey's attack on Anjou,
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> further secured his realm by making the King of
Scots pay him homage at Chester, and give up the earldoms of Cumberland and <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, which he had received from the late king. In an attack on Wales he was less happy, for in a fight at Consilt Pass, the standard-bearer of
England, Henry, Earl of Essex, threw down the royal banner and fled, whereon the English, supposing the king to be

 slain, turned to flight. However, Owen, the Welsh prince, knowing his foe's power, was glad to make peace. Henry of
Essex was afterwards accused of treason, and defeated by
Robert of Montfort in trial by battle, but was permitted to become a monk, forfeiting all his lands and goods, but saving his life.</p>
  <p>Wishing to bring about a lasting peace with the King of
France, <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> now sent his Chancellor in great state to
France to arrange a marriage between his own little son Henry and <persName key="Louis VII.">Louis</persName>' baby daughter Margaret, and himself paid a friendly visit to Paris. But in <date value ="1159">1159</date>, when he claimed Toulouse by right of his wife from Raymond of S. Giles, the French king opposed him and war began. By <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>' advice <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> made his knights pay scutage [shield-money] instead of service-in-arms, and by this means hired foreign soldiers who would follow him as long as he could pay them, whereas the knights only owed him forty days' service, and the fyrd could not be ordered abroad. The King of Scots, the Prince of Wales, and Raymond, Earl of Barcelona, joined the English army, and <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> laid siege to Toulouse; but when <persName key="Louis VII.">Louis</persName> threw himself into the city, he was unwilling to fight against his suzerain [feudal lord], and though <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> laughed at his scruples, raised the siege and withdrew his troops. Still the two kings did not become friends; for <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> got leave from the Pope to marry the two children, and so, greatly to <persName key="Louis VII.">Louis</persName>' disgust, took possession of the Vexin, Margaret's dowry, long before the French king thought of losing it. However, in <date value ="1161">1161</date>, the two princes met at Chateauroux to decide which
Pope they would acknowledge; for after the death of Adrian
IV. (Nicholas Breakspear, <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s firm friend, the only
Englishman who was ever Bishop of Rome) a deadly dispute had arisen between the cardinals, and two rival popes had been chosen. In spite of his friendship for the Emperor
Frederick, who favoured Victor, <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> agreed with <persName key="Louis VII.">Louis</persName> to stand by <persName key="Alexander II., Pope">Alexander</persName>.</p>

In <date value ="1162">1162</date> the English bishops, willing to please <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>, chose his friend the Chancellor to fill the vacant see of Canterbury. <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas Beket</persName> was the son of a rich Norman merchant, Gilbert, sometime port-reeve of London, and his wife,
Maud of C&#x00E6;n, who had brought him up with great care, sending him to the hall of Richer of L'Aigle, his father's friend, to learn courtly behaviour, and to the office of the wealthy Osbern Eightpenny to be taught business. He was for a time at the University of Paris, and is said to have been a pupil of the famous lawyer Gratian at Bologna. Taken into the household

 of Archbishop Theobald, he had served him skilfully at home and abroad, and, in spite of jealous enemies, such as
Roger of Pont l'Eveque, gained his high esteem. With his master he took part in the reforms of <date value ="1154">1154</date>, in which year he was made Archdeacon of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>. <note place="foot" n="2">The struggle with <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>, <dateRange from="1164" to="1170">1164-1170</dateRange>.</note>
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> soon singled him out as a bold and able man, and besides giving him the chancery, promoted him to other posts of trust. As keeper of the Tower and castellan of Eye, he led 700 knights in the Toulouse war, where he did many deeds of arms, and overcame a
French knight, Ingelram of Trie, in single combat. Several well-known stories witness to his close friendship with the king; his kindliness, and the open-handed hospitality, in which he surpassed all his predecessors, assured the favour of the people. <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> is described as tall and spare, but strong-limbed, dark-haired, pale-cheeked, of pleasing countenance, blithe manners, and quick, frank speech, stammering a little when he was moved. In youth he had been known as a good chess-player, a bold rider, and keen sportsman.
He was always a hater of liars and slanderers, and a kind friend to dumb beasts and all poor and helpless folk.</p>
  <p><persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> looked to his new archbishop for aid in the plans he was now devising for bounding the powers of the Church courts and bettering the law, but <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> made up his mind to serve the Church as singly and zealously as he had hitherto served the king, and at once gave up the Chancellorship, much to the king's displeasure. He then took measures against some courtiers who were, he believed, defrauding the see of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, and at the Great Council of Woodstock in <date value ="1162">1162</date> successfully withstood the king to the face, when he wished to turn the Dangeld shire-fees into a regular tax to be newly assessed, declaring that he would not suffer a penny to be paid off his or any other land. At the same time he entirely changed his mode of life, giving up all courtly amusements and worldly business, and spending all his time in the care of his diocese, the relief of the poor and sick, and his religious duties, fasting often, secretly scourging himself daily for penance, and wearing a haircloth next his skin, though he still dressed richly and kept grand state. In <date value ="1163">1163</date> at a Great Council at Westminster, in consequence of a case in which a clergyman had committed a crime and, being claimed by the Church, escaped capital punishment, the king determined to put an end to this conflict of laws by which evil-doers might profit, and asked the bishops whether for the future they would be willing to

 abide by the Old Customs of the realm, as settled in his grandfather's day. To this all agreed <quote>"saving the rights of their order,"</quote> whereupon <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> ordered his justiciar,
Richard of Lucy, and his clerk, Jocelin of Balliol, to draw up a list of these Old Customs. Sixteen Constitutions or
Articles were accordingly set before the bishops in a Great
Council at Clarendon, January <date value ="1164">1164</date>.</p>
  <p>By these--1. Bishops were to be chosen by the king's consent, and must do him homage and attend his courts like other barons, save when capital offences were being dealt with.</p>
  <p>2. All questions touching Church patronage, land held by lay service (rent or service-in-arms), contracts,capital offences committed by clergymen, and injuries done to the clergy by laymen were to be tried in the king's courts.</p>
  <p>3. Lesser offences committed by clergymen against laymen or their fellow-clergy, and suits relating to land held by spiritual service (the performance of Church duties) were to be tried in the Church courts.</p>
  <p>4. No layman was to be punished by the Church courts, and no clergyman might leave the realm or appeal to Rome without first getting the king's leave.</p>
  <p>5. No serf might be ordained without his lord's leave.
  <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> protested that these Constitutions attacked the liberties of the Church, which the king in his coronation oath had sworn to maintain, and was only persuaded to sign them by the prayer of his fellow-bishops. Directly he had signed them he repented, withdrew his signature, and sent to beg forgiveness of the Pope for having wronged the
Church. His enemies took care to fan <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s natural anger at his old friend's opposition, and another Council met at Northampton, 8th October <date value ="1164">1164</date>, where the archbishop was accused of denying justice to John the Treasury-Marshal, found guilty, and heavily fined; and further ordered to account for 30,000 marks spent by him while Chancellor.
In vain he proved that the Justiciar Richard had set him free of all claims when he laid down his office. The king would not stay the proceedings unless <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> would agree to the Constitutions. Whereupon the archbishop came into the Council in full robes with the crosier in his hand, and refusing to allow Earl Robert to pass sentence against him, put himself and the Church under the keeping of God and the Pope. There were shouts of anger at his words. Earl
Hamelin, the king's brother, and Randulf of Brok cried,
<q type="spoken">"Traitor ! traitor!"</q> and others tore up the rushes from the



<pb id="p.95" n="95"/>


 floor and flung them at him.  Turning fiercely to the earl,
<q type="spoken">"If I might bear arms,"</q> he said, <q type="spoken">" I would quickly prove on you that you lied."</q> <q type="spoken">" You, Randulf, look at home [his cousin has lately been hanged for felony] before you accuse the guiltless ! "</q> and passed out of the hall.</p>
   <p>Hopeless of aid from his fellow-bishops, who all sided with
 the king, he fled in disguise to Flanders that very night.
 Both parties appealed to <persName key="Alexander II., Pope">Alexander</persName>, who was then at Sens.
 <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> in his anger cruelly banished all <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>' friends and
 kinsmen, 400 in number; but the French king, who took up
 the archbishop's cause warmly, received them and gave
 them lodging and food in his domains. Knowing that the
 <title>Emperor</title> <persName key="Frederick I.">Frederick</persName> (to whose friend Henry the Lion, Duke
 of Saxony, the English king had just betrothed his daughter
 Margaret) was trying to gain King <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s help for his new
 antipope Pascal [Victor's successor], <persName key="Alexander II., Pope">Alexander</persName> was luke-warm in backing <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>' cause, though he could not
 honestly give it up, and let the case drag on.
 Meanwhile the English king strengthened himself by
 getting the hand of Constance, heiress of Richmond and
 Brittany, for his third son Geoffrey, and went on with his
 law reforms. Early in <date value ="1166">1166</date> he issued the Assize of Clarendon, instructions for the judges going on circuit; for,
 copying the plan of his grandfather (who had sent his judges
 to the county courts to hear and decide revenue cases), he
 had ordered them  to try all important cases, civil or
 criminal, in the shire courts, thus preventing the feudal lords
 from setting up private courts of justice of their own, apart
 from the royal authority, and curbing the sheriffs, who might
 have used their offices to advance their own power if not
 checked by the king's judges. This assize obliged all land-holders to attend the county courts, restored the old grand
 jury, fallen into disuse in <persName key="Stephen">Stephen</persName>'s days, and provided that
 all accused must clear themselves before the king's judges
 by the inquest of twelve sworn neighbours (our petty jury) or
 by wager of battle, or else leave the kingdom, even though
 they could clear themselves by ordeal, for it was now felt
 that the ordeal was merely a matter of chance.</p>
 	<p>In June, weary of the Pope's delay, <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> reopened the
 quarrel by excommunicating the Justiciar Richard and
 others for upholding the Constitutions, and Randulf of Brok
 for taking a piece of Church land. They appealed to the
 Pope against this sentence, and <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> threatened to banish
 the Cistercians because their brethren were sheltering the archbishop at Pontigny.  He therefore moved to Sens

(where his vestments may still be seen), and the King of
France and many discontented nobles in Brittany, Poitou, and Guienne took up arms in his favour, the Earl of
Flanders even threatening to invade England.  But Alexander, whom Frederick had driven from Rome, feared King
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s power, and did his best to reconcile him with
<persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>. After many meetings, a kind of truce was patched up in <date value ="1169">1169</date>, the king still refusing to give the archbishop the kiss of peace (the sign of friendship), and the archbishop still condemning the Constitutions.</p>
  <p>3. In <date value ="1170">1170</date> <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> determined to make his eldest son king in his lifetime, after the French fashion, that there might always be some one in England to see the laws enforced when he himself was obliged to be in his foreign dominions.
Accordingly <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Beket</persName>'s old foe Roger, now Archbishop of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, hallowed the young Henry king at Westminster, January 14,
<date value ="1170">1170</date>, the old king serving as cupbearer at the coronation feast. <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>, furious at this breach of his rights, for it was the privilege of the Archbishop of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> to crown all
English kings, got the Pope's order to suspend Roger, and the Bishops of London and Salisbury, his abettors, from their offices, and King <persName key="Louis VII.">Louis</persName> threatened war because his daughter had not been crowned with her husband. Hastening to France, Henry made friends with <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>, and gave him leave to return to his see. The archbishop started at once, but found scant welcome in England after his seven years' exile, for most men held with the king, and looked on him as a traitor, save the poor, who remembered his charity.
Roger laughed at his complaints, the young king, his former pupil, would not receive him and forbade him to leave his see, and those who had wasted his lands and goods refused to make good the damage. <note place="foot" n="1">The death of Archbishop <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>, Dec. <date value ="1170">1170</date>.</note>At last, on Christmas Day, he read the sentence on Roger and the two bishops, and cast Randulf of Brok and his brother
Robert out of the pale of the Church for insulting him by docking the tail of one of his packhorses. The bishops crossed the sea at once to complain to the king, who was keeping his Christmas at Bur. When
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> heard of it he fell into one of those terrible rages to which he sometimes gave way. <q type="spoken">" Here is a man that has eaten my bread, a pitiful fellow that came to my court on a sorry hackney, and owes all he has to me, lifting his heel against me, and insulting my kingdom and my kindred.

<pb id="p.97" n="97"/>



   <p>Four of the king's knights, Reginald Fitz-Urse, William
 of Tracy, Hugh of Moreville, and Richard the Breton, hearing these words and the saying of Roger of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, <quote>" As soon
 as <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> is dead all this trouble will be at an end, but
 not before,"</quote> took ship at once for England. They passed the
 night of the 28th December at Saltwood Castle with Randulf
 of Brok, and next day rode on to <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> with Hugh of
 Horsea, called the Evil Deacon, and twelve of Randulf's men.
 Making their way at once to the archbishop's chamber, they
 found him sitting on his bed talking to John of Salisbury
 his clerk, Edward Grim a young priest, and a few other
 friends. He recognised Reginald, William, and Hugh, who
 had once served under him, but waited for them to speak.
 <q type="spoken">" We bring you the king's order,"</q> said Reginald, "<q type="spoken"> to do
 your duty and absolve the bishops without more delay."</q>
 <q type="spoken">" I have only enforced the Pope's order. I have always
 done my duty to the king."</q>
 <q type="spoken">"Avoy !"</q> they cried, <q type="spoken">"you have broken his commands
 again and again."</q>
<q type="spoken"> "But, Reginald, you yourself saw him reconciled to me."</q>
<q type="spoken"> " Never."</q>
 <q type="spoken">"Nay, I saw you there with my own eyes! Besides,
 Randulf and his brother have wronged me and my men ! "</q>
 <q type="spoken">" You have your remedy in the king's court, seek it there !"</q>
 <q type="spoken">"I shall do justice myself on all that wrong the Church.
 But enough of this. You should remember the tie between
 us, Reginald !"</q>
 <q type="spoken">" We are the king's men, and owe fealty to no one against
 him. Do you threaten us?"</q>
 Then they bit their gloves, and defied the archbishop
 angrily, bidding his servants keep him in the precincts on
 peril of their heads, and left the room.
 <q type="spoken">" Ah, my lord,"</q> cried John of Salisbury, <q type="spoken">" why will you not
 listen to us and deal gently with your enemies?"</q>
 <q type="spoken">"I gave way once, John; I will never give way again."</q>
 <q type="spoken">"You are ready to die, my lord, but we are not; think of
 our peril."</q>
 <q type="spoken">"God's will be done! "</q>
 Meanwhile the knights were arming themselves in the
 courtyard; when the frightened monks saw them by the
 apple-tree in their mail-shirts with drawn swords, they ran
 to the archbishop and begged him to fly to the cathedral,
 but he laughed at their fears-<q type="spoken">" All you monks are cowards,
 I think ! "</q>-and would not stir till the vesper bell rang, when he walked to the minster. The knights now broke into the

 cloister, and reaching S. Bennetts chapel just after him, began hammering at the door, which the monks had barred behind them. <q type="spoken">" Unbolt that door! "</q> said <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>, <q type="spoken">" I will not have God's house made a fortress for me."</q> Then he slipped back the bar himself, refusing to fly, and when the angry knights rushed in with cries of<q type="spoken"> "Where is the traitor?
Where is the archbishop?"</q> turned to meet them. <q type="spoken">" Here I am; but why do you, Reginald, of all men, come armed into church against me ?"</q> Reginald caught hold of his mantle,
<q type="spoken">" Traitor that you are, come out of the church ! "</q> but he tore the mantle from him with a bitter answer, refusing to leave<q type="spoken"> the cathedral.  <q type="spoken">" Absolve the bishops then !</q>  " Not till they make amends for their sin."</q> <q type="spoken">"Then you must die here ! "</q>  <q type="spoken">You cannot frighten me; I am ready to die, but let my men go free!"</q> They tried to drag him from the chapel, but he clung to the great pillar, and Edward Grim held him fast, till Tracy, who had thrown off his heavy mail-coat that he might move the easier, laid hands on him, when the archbishop grew angry and hurled him to the ground. With that Fitz-Urse shouted <q type="spoken">"Strike! strike!"</q> and smote off his coif with his sword, and Tracy leaped up and cut savagely at his bare head. The brave Grim dashed between them, caught the blade on his arm, and fell back badly wounded, but the point gashed <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>' brow, and the blood ran down his face. He never flinched, though he knew his hour was come, but bowed his head, and commended his cause and that of the Church to God, S. Denis, and the saints of the minster. Moreville drew back shocked, but Reginald struck him again, and Tracy felled him senseless to the pavement. Richard (whose master, Earl William,
<persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> had parted from his wife) struck at him as he lay, crying, <q type="spoken">"This for the earl's sake!"</q> and the Evil Deacon brutally mangled the dead man's head. <q type="spoken">" Let us go now,"</q> said Fitz-Urse, <q type="spoken">"he will never rise again ;"</q> and shouting
<q type="spoken">" King's knights! king's knights! "</q> they rushed off to plunder the palace. The monks crept back in the dark and took up the corpse, doubting whether the archbishop had been justly slain or no, but when below his splendid robes they found the haircloth he always wore, and saw on his body the marks of the stripes of his daily penance, their doubts fled and they proclaimed him a martyr. The news horrified all that heard it, and <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s grief for his hasty words was deep and true.
He sent instant explanations to the Pope, and then fearing that his enemies might prevail with him, started on an expedition to Ireland, where he stayed till the Pope's legates came to

Normandy, when he cleared himself before them by oath at
Avranches of all foreknowledge of the archbishop's death, promised to give up the Constitutions, and to stand by Alexander against the emperor. <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> was canonized in <date value ="1174">1174</date>; a splendid shrine rose at <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> in his honour, to which, through the fame of his miraculous power, crowds of pilgrims flocked from all parts for healing, and many churches were built in his honour.</p>
  <p>However, the results of the struggle were not unfavourable to the king; he had no further trouble with the Church, and the Constitutions held good in deed, though not in name, and it is likely that but for the murder, <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> would have lived to see the defeat of his cause. But it must be held in mind that the archbishop had on his side the Church or
Canon Law, which he had sworn to obey, and certainly the lay courts erred as much on the side of harshness and cruelty as those of the Church on that of foolish pity towards evil-doers. <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName> would doubtless have withstood an evil king as boldly as he resisted a good one, and in the reverence of centuries he has had his reward. One of his secretaries sums up the matter: <quote>" Nothing is more sure than that both strove earnestly to please God; one for the sake of his people, the other on behalf of the Church; but whether of the two was zealous according to knowledge is not manifest to man, who is so easily mistaken, but to the Lord, who will judge between them at the last day."</quote></p>

  <p>Palladius, Pope C&#x00E6;lestine's archdeacon, was the first to preach the Gospel to the Irish, but they would not hear him.
To <persName key="Patrick, Saint">Patrick</persName>, however, a Welshman who had been a slave among them in his youth, and went back in <date value ="440">440</date>to teach them the New Faith, they listened gladly and became Christians. As the hymn tells-

  <p>Christianity worked less change in Ireland than in England.  It did away, indeed, with many foul superstitions and cruelties, replaced the Druids' colleges by monastic families and schools, brought in such Roman civilization as had survived in the towns of West Britain (whence Patrick and most of his followers came), introducing the Latin alphabet, tongue, and learning; but it did little to unite the warring tribes, and could not check the feuds which kept them apart. The Irish Church always remained in form a missionary Church; in each tribe there arose a monastery round the cell of some saintly teacher who had gathered to him a body of disciples, as <persName key="Columba">Columba</persName>, for instance, did at Hy.
An abbot, often of royal blood, ruled this minster, and under his orders a number of bishops and priests went forth to minister to the small churches of the different septs or clans which make up the tribe, or travelled to more distant lands, Helvetia, <placeName key="Caledonia">Caledonia</placeName>, or England, where their noble labours were, perhaps, more successful and famous than at home. But though these pious and learned Irish Churchmen had less influence over the daily life of their countrymen than our more ignorant and less ascetic parish clergy, they justly earned for their land the name of the Isle of
Saints.</p>
  <p>The soil, climate, and shape of Ireland, which made it a paradise for a pastoral people, were all unfavourable to agriculture or trade, and it was not easy for the tribes, had they wished it, to join under one strong central government,



<pb id="p.101" n=" 101"/>

 or for the farmers to improve their tillage, and take to settled village life as the English had done; so that the account given above of the Britons before the Romans came, may well serve for that of the Irish down to the beginning of the ninth century.</p>
  <p>About that time the Ostmen [men from the East, i.e. Norwegians], after many years of plundering, began to settle,
Thorgils and his brother first, and after them Anlaf, Sihtric, and <persName key="Ingwar the Boneless">Ingwar</persName>, the sons of <persName key="Ragnar">Ragnar</persName>, setting up colonies along the south and east coasts at Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford, and in the Isle of Man. The history of those little states is made up of wars with the native Irish, forays and trading voyages into Wales and England, and emigrations to the far northern islands Iceland and the F&#x00E6;reys. They were forced to acknowledge the overlordship of <persName key="Eadgar">Eadgar</persName> and
Cnut, and <persName key="Boru, Brian">Brian</persName> of the Tribute, Head-King of Ireland, put a limit to their conquests by his victory at <placeName key="Clontarf"><hi rend="italics">Clontarf</hi></placeName>, Good

<persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> was their firm ally. Upon the Irish, beyond the momentary union the dread of them brought about, and the introduction of new weapons and better shipping, the Ostmen's influence was slight; though, on the other hand, the
Ostmen learned Christianity from the Irish, and gained the knowledge of many arts, such as music, harp-playing, new kinds and forms of poetry, the Roman alphabet, and the way of putting together and telling histories and legends in regular form.</p>

Waterford, gallantly held by Rognwald and the two Sihtrics, and won back Leinster. Diarmaid now fulfilled his bargain and gave Eva his daughter to <persName key="Strongbow, Richard">Strongbow</persName> to wife, and promised him his kingdom when he died, which by Irish law he had no right to do. The allies then beset Dublin, ruled by the

Haskulf escaping to the Western Isles with his galleys.
There he got help and came back with John the Mad, a
Norwegian wicking, to try and recover the city, but they were both taken and slain. Roderick the high-king, now awakened to his danger and hoping to crush the strangers at one blow (for Diarmaid died at this moment and
<persName key="Strongbow, Richard">Strongbow</persName>'s claim to his throne was resisted even in Leinster), laid siege to Dublin by land with a huge host, while Guthred,
King of Man, blockaded the harbour with sixty war-ships.
Provisions ran low in the town, but in their despair the
English knights made a sudden and furious sally, throwing the undisciplined Irish into panic flight, whereupon Guthred, seeing his cause hopeless, sailed back to Man. A third attack by O'Ruairc and the men of Meath was easily met, and Waterford, lost for a moment, speedily retaken.</p>
  <p>All Leinster, great part of Desmond [South Munster] and Meath, and the Ostmen's coast towns had been won in a few months. King <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> was alarmed at <persName key="Strongbow, Richard">Strongbow</persName>'s success, and fearing lest he should set up a rival kingdom in the new-won land, recalled him to England. He obeyed, crossed to Newnham, and there did homage to the king for
Dublin and Leinster. <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> then set out with 500 knights and thousands of archers in a fleet of 400 sail to visit his new domains. In a wattled palace near Dublin he received the homage of the Irish kings of Munster and lords of
Kinsale, Oriel, and Ulster, and even compelled the high-king to agree to a truce (which in <date value ="1175">1175</date> was changed to a peace at Windsor by the efforts of Lawrence O'Toole, the holy Archbishop of Dublin). The Irish clergy, under the
Bishop of Lismore, the Pope's legate, met at <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="Cashel">Cashel</placeName></hi> and accepted the rule of the English king, who granted them freedom from all taxes, purveyance [duty of feeding the king's court], and were-gilds, and provided for their regular maintenance by tithes. Having caused a survey to

 be made of the conquered country, the English Pale or
Border as it was called, <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> confirmed Waterford and
Wexford to Fitz-Gerald and Hervey his kinsmen, and made
<persName key="Strongbow, Richard">Strongbow</persName> Marshal of Ireland, settling friends of his own beside them, Hugh of Lacy as Justiciar and Constable in
Meath, and Theobald Walter, <persName key="Beket, Thomas">Thomas</persName>'s sister's son, as Butler in Ormond [North Munster]. He also set up Royal Courts in Dublin and established English law in the Pale. He then went back to Normandy, before he could build the line of castles he had planned along the border, to meet the
Pope's messengers. He wished to make his favourite son,
Earl <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, King of Ireland, and Pope Urban even sent him a crown of peacock's feathers for him; but the young man's foolish and insulting behaviour to the Irish chiefs, when he was governor there in <date value ="1185">1185</date>, put an end to this plan.</p>
  <p>The conquest of Down in <date value ="1177">1177</date> by John of Courcy, son-in-law of Guthred, King of Man, and the settlement of the Graces,
MacMahons, De Burghs, and other Norman families, north, west, and south of the Pale, complete the story of the Settlement. For the next 150 years Irish history tells of little but cruel feuds between the native tribes, endless wars between them and the English settlers, and deadly struggles between these settlers themselves, one party headed by the
Geraldines (Fitz-Gerald's kin) and the other by the Butlers, which the king's governors of the Pale were powerless to check or put down.</p>
<p>Earl <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s tutor, Gerald of Barry, a Welsh priest, whose kinsmen Fitz-Gerald, Miles Cogan, and others were the heroes of the Conquest, has left a lively account of Ireland in his day, which explains the rapid success of the invasion.
Besides the chiefs' guards, gallowglasses armed in Norwegian fashion, the Irish had only their armourless kernes, footmen, with darts, knives, stones, and wicker shields, or little iron bucklers, to oppose the mail-clad knights, disciplined Flemish men-at-arms, and skilful Welsh archers.
Even the invaders' small numbers were in their favour when set against unwieldy crowds of untrained men, as Cortez and
Pizarro found in like case. Only in the cities did they meet with able resistance, for there horsemanship was of no avail, and the Ostman, as well armed and trained as themselves, met broadsword and lance with his terrible war-axe, and only yielded when he could fight no longer. Nor could all the skill of <persName key="Strongbow, Richard">Richard Strongbow</persName> himself, that cheery cool-headed leader with the fair womanly face, large bright eyes, and shrill voice, nor all the well-ordered bravery of his

 followers have ensured success, without the help of Diarmaid, the disunion and feuds of the Irish princes, and the neutrality of the Irish clergy, who believed that God had sent the strangers as a scourge upon the land because of the national sins of cruelty, treachery, and the slave-trade.</p>
  <p>Among the things which struck Gerald as peculiar to this hitherto-unknown land are the quaint Irish costumes,-the men's pleated saffron-dyed shirts, parti-coloured hoods, cloth breeches, cowskin brogues, and red mantles, and the women's long-sleeved sarks and huge cloaks; the little horses ridden without saddle or stirrups, and the fine cattle, the mainstay of life (for in Ireland feudalism was founded upon the giving and taking of stock, not land). He admires their wit, poetry, and harp-playing, wonders at their primitive law and curious old customs, notices their deep reverence for holy places and relics, blames the drunkenness and praises the piety of their clergy; and tells of the strong clan-feeling, fickleness, and turbulence of the axe-bearing Irish gentry,-characteristics which appear almost unchanged in the later accounts of the same people by <persName key="Froissart, John">Froissart</persName> in <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>'s and Spenser in
<persName key="Elizabeth I.">Elizabeth</persName>'s days.</p>
  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="5">The great rebellion of <date value ="1174">1174</date></note><persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s worst foes were ever those of his own house-hold. His wife Eleanor did not live happily with him, and encouraged her headstrong and undutiful sons to defy their father.  In <date value ="1173">1173</date> the young king, chafing at being king only in name, for his father would not trust him to rule alone in Normandy or England, and sorely angered at the banishment of one of his favourites, went off secretly by night to S. Denis, and getting help of King <persName key="Louis VII.">Louis</persName>, took up arms.
The Earls of Flanders, Boulogne, and Blois, jealous of
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s power in France, eagerly espoused his cause; his brothers, Geoffrey of Brittany and Richard of Poitou, joined him with their vassals; and many of the great nobles of
England, especially those that still held lands in Normandy, disliking <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>'s good law and longing for a king who would allow them to deal with their men as they liked, gladly rose in rebellion. <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>, seeing the danger, at once hired 10,000  Brabanters, drove
<persName key="Louis VII.">Louis</persName> out of Normandy, and crushed the revolt in Brittany, defeating the rebels at Dol and capturing their ringleaders,
Hugh, Earl of Chester, and Raoul of Fougeres. The young king now incited William the Lion, King of Scots, to attack
England, promising him those northern counties, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, which his father had refused to give up to him. He accordingly invaded England



<pb id="p.105" n="105"/>
 with an army of Galloway men and Highlanders, who plundered the country most horribly, but were unable to take the border towns, in which the English barons held out stoutly till the Justiciar Lucy the loyal and the bold Constable Humfrey of Bohun could come to their aid. They managed to obtain a truce from King William, and hastened south to save England; for the Earl of Leicester and his warlike wife Pernel had landed at Orwell with 1500
Flemings, had been at once joined by the Earls of Norfolk and Derby, and had already taken <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName>. A sudden attack upon the invaders near Bury S. Edmunds threw them into disorder, the earl was taken, and the countess, who had ridden through Norfolk in armour like a knight, fell into a ditch in her flight, where she lost her rich rings and was almost drowned before her captors could rescue her. The country-folk, angry at the ravages of the Flemings, came out with their forks and flails and killed every foreigner they could lay hands on.</p>
  <p>England was, however, not yet safe. Roger of Mowbray with the Earls of Derby and Norfolk were still in the field, and the Earl of Leicester's castles garrisoned against the king. A second Flemish invasion was threatened, for young Henry and the Earl of Flanders were at Gravelines with a fleet waiting only for a fair wind. Earl David of
Huntingdon, King William's brother, had marched to relieve
Leicester with a proud company of Scottish knights, and the truce being over, the Scottish king himself was again besetting the northern towns. The <foreign lang="ANGLOSAXON">fyrd</foreign> of the northern shires, however, turned out against him, and the northern barons and gentry quitted themselves like men. Lucy had sent already for King <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>, who having quelled the revolt in Poitou, was now able to sail for England. On the way to London he stopped at <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> to do penance at

There he was scourged by the monks as penance, and passed the night watching, fasting, and praying on the bare ground by the tomb. Next day he started for London, where he was warmly welcomed by the faithful citizens. <quote>"Worn out with anxiety, fatigue, and long fasting, he was leaning on his elbow half asleep on his couch that evening, while a servant rubbed his feet, when there came a messenger to the door, calling softly to the chamberlain, <q type="spoken">'Let me in !

  <p>On the 13th July, Odinel of Umfraville, hearing that
King William with sixty knights and a few Flemings had gone on before his host to Alnwick, proposed to <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> of
Glanville to fall upon him at once while he was unprepared.
Under cover of a fog they rode unseen to the meadow where
William was tilting with his knights, and raised their war-cry. The king put on his helmet, mounted his grey steed, and shouting to his friends, <quote>" Now we can soon prove who is the best man !"</quote> charged the English barons. But the grey horse was thrust through with a lance, and fell, dragging its rider to the ground, so that he could not rise and was at once taken prisoner. Most of his knights were captured with him, but the Flemings were slain without quarter. When it was known that King William had been sent prisoner to

With this the rebellion ended. <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> was very merciful, he forgave his undutiful sons, let the traitor earls go free, with the loss of their castles only, many of which he pulled down, and released the King of Scots by a treaty sworn at

  <p>Next year <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> and Geoffrey quarrelled with <persName key="Richard I">Richard</persName>, and the king with difficulty stopped this civil war.

Fever-stricken and disheartened by his son's treachery, <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> saw his birthplace, Le Mans, taken before his eyes, and was unable to save Tours.

As he gave the kiss of peace to his traitor son, he prayed God to let him live long enough to punish him; but when he found that <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, for whom he had suffered this dishonour, had been leagued against him, his heart broke, he threw himself on his bed, with his face to the wall, and groaned, <q type="spoken">"Let things go as they will, I care no more for myself or anything in the world."</q> Two days more he lingered, crying in his fever, <q type="spoken">"Shame, shame on a conquered king!"</q> and then, on the 7th July, died in the arms of his one faithful son, Geoffrey the Chancellor. <persName key="Richard I">Richard</persName> now repented, but all he could do was to follow his father's body with bitter tears to its grave at Font-Evraud.</p>

His ungloved hands were rough and scarred with work, his legs bowed with riding, and his voice harsh from shouting to his soldiers and his hounds. His subjects knew him as a wise and mighty king, merciful and careful of his people's rights, but bearing not the sword in vain, the father of the poor, the wayfarer, and the stranger, <soCalled>"the flower of the princes of this world;" </soCalled>but we must look on him as the great lawyer who linked the free old English local moots to the strong central Royal Court by his plan of petty juries and judges of assize, a system which in substance is ours of to-day. We may be thankful also to the wise statesman who saved England from the barons' tyranny and the despotism of the Church, and made firm the foundations upon which his successors have reared the free Constitutions under which the English-speaking peoples are now living.</p>

As for the most part they gained their living by money-lending, which the Church forbade to
Christians, and as they were thought to use witchcraft and believed to kidnap Christian children and slay them for sacrifice at their passover, they were much hated by the people. The Church also looked with disfavour upon them because of their religion. But the kings, who took care to make them pay highly for the rights they gave them and shared in their gains, found them a useful source of

<pb id="p.111" n="111"/>


 income. They used to wear a dress of their own, and dwell apart from their fellow-townsmen in walled and gated quarters of the town called Jewries, governed by their own rabbis, and living under their own law.</p>
  <p>On <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s coronation day no Jew or woman was allowed to come into the king's presence for fear of witchcraft, but in the afternoon, while the people were crowding at the gate of the banqueting-room to get a sight of <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, some hapless Jewish Elders, who had come up (as the custom was) to bring gifts to the new king, were thrust by the press inside the doors. The royal servants cast them out with blows and curses, whereon the mob fell upon them and beat them shamefully, and raising a cry that the king had commanded all the Jews to be slain, rushed off to attack the
London Jewry. House after house was broken into, sacked and fired, and the inmates cruelly slain. The rioting was so great, and the mob so savage (for all the prisoners had been set free in honour of the new king, and many vagabonds and outlaws from all parts of the country had thronged up to
London to join in the merry-making of the coronation day), that <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> could not quell the tumult, and peace was not restored till next day, when <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> punished some of the ringleaders and proclaimed peace for the Jews. But as soon as he left the country the hatred and greed of the people broke out afresh against them. At the great fair at Lynn, a rich trading town, a quarrel between a converted Jew and his kinsfolk brought on a massacre. At Stamford, where many zealous crusaders had gathered at Lent for their journey abroad, the Jewry was plundered. At <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> the Jews only saved their lives by fleeing to the castle. In <placeName key="York">York</placeName> they also took refuge with their treasures in the keep, and fearing treachery, refused to let in even the governor.

Lord !"</q> The despairing Jews kept them off with stones which they tore from the inside of the building, for they had no weapons; but when the war-engines were brought up one night and set ready for next morning's attack they knew that they could hold out no longer. Then Rabbi Eliezer, a learned elder, said to his brethren, <q type="spoken">" O men of Isr&#x00E6;l, God- of whom no man asketh, Why doest Thou this ?-hath commanded us to lay down our lives for His Law, and behold
Death standeth at the door. Now therefore, unless ye would

 meet that which is worse than death and give up His Holy
Law, let us freely with our own hands offer up our lives to
God that gave them, as many of our people have done in times past, worthily delivering themselves out of great tribulations." </q>The greater part took his advice, and having burned or destroyed their treasures and goods and set fire to the castle, they first put all the women and children among them to death and then slew themselves. Next morning the few who had not been willing to die, opened the gates, and came forth begging to be baptized, but the wicked Richard Ill-Beast and his followers slew them all in cold blood. They then destroyed all the bonds of the Jews which were kept in the cathedral, and fearing the king's anger, scattered hastily, some going on the Crusade, some flying to Scotland, so that when the Justiciar came to punish them the guilty ringleaders could not be found, and he was only able to turn out the sheriff and fine the town.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="2"><persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s Crusade <dateRange from="1191" to="1192">1191-1192</dateRange>.</note>In
August <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> left Marseilles in his galley Trenche-Mer and coasted down to Messina, whither
Philip had already marched by land.  The
English fleet of 100 sail, which had been sent round from Dartmouth and had stopped at Lisbon on its way, to help King Sancho of Portugal against an invasion of the Moors, was awaiting him there. Having sent on a strong force under <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>, Earl of Champagne, <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s nephew, and <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> of Glanville to the Holy Land, the two kings resolved to winter in Sicily. But troubles soon broke out. The people of Messina ill-treating and insulting his men, <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> hanged the evil-doers and stormed the city, building a large wooden castle, which he called Mate-Griffon or Greek-tamer [the Greek-speaking Italians being called Greeks by the crusaders].  He also sent to King Tancred of Sicily, who had succeeded his brother-in-law William the Good, to ask him to give up his widowed sister Joan, her dowry and the legacy of the late king-a golden table with 24 golden cups and platters, a silk tent, and 100 galleys laden with
60,000 measures of wine and a like quantity of wheat and barley. Tancred, frightened at the loss of his town, paid
<persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> 40,000 ounces of gold in place of the dowry and legacy, and got his promise to help him against the emperor, who claimed Sicily against him. The lavish bounty and soldierly bearing of the English king won him great honour, and Philip could ill brook to be held of less account than his vassal, so when he found that <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> did not mean to marry his sister Alice, to whom he had been long betrothed,



<pb id="p.113" n="113"/>
 but was about to wed Berengar, the sister of the King of
Navarre, he was not easily appeased. But by the good offices of the Earl of Flanders the two kings were for a time reconciled, and Philip started for Acre March 30, <date value ="1191">1191</date>.
<persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, having sent home his last commands by his mother
Eleanor, who had come out to Messina to bring him the Lady
Berengar and 30 store-ships, soon followed. Near Cyprus his fleet was overtaken by a storm and two vessels driven ashore, when Isaac, emperor of the island, seized the cargoes and imprisoned the shipwrecked crews. <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> at once landed and stormed Limasol. He was now joined by Guy,
King of Jerusalem, who had come from Palestine to meet him, and held his wedding on May 12 in grand state. He then won the rest of the island, taking Isaac prisoner and sending him in silver chains to Tripoli, and set sail again.</p>
  <p>On the afternoon of the 7th of June a huge dromond [big merchant ship] was spied under French colours, but when they came up with her she was found to be a Saracen vessel laden with arms and treasure for the besieged Mahommedans in Acre. Threatening to hang his sailors if they let her get away, <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> led the attack with the Trenche-Mer. The
Saracens drove off the boarders with their arrows and Greek fire, but the dromond's huge sides were soon pierced by the sharp prows of the nimble English war-galleys and she sank with all her rich cargo, only 46 of her crew of 1500 men being picked up by the king's boats.</p>
  <p>Next day <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> reached Acre, which was then in the hands of the Saracens, who were defending it against the kings of France and Jerusalem. He at once blockaded the port with his fleet, and putting up his castle Mate-Griffon, began to set up large and powerful mangonels or slinging-engines and stone-casters, for he was a skilled engineer, while his sappers plied their spades and picks against the foundations of the walls.  Though ill of the ague, from which he often suffered, he was carried in a litter to the trenches, and used his arblast against the Mahommedans on the ramparts, egging on his soldiers the while with promises of reward and overlooking the working of his engines. The King of France also played his part as a brave leader, and on July 12 the besieged gave up the town on condition of being exchanged for the Christians taken at Tiberias. It was now that Leopold, Duke of Austria
(who had come with the German crusaders to Palestine following the <title>Emperor</title> <persName key="Frederick I.">Frederick</persName>, who had been drowned on the way), quarrelled with the English king because his banner

 had been insultingly thrown down from the tower on which it had been raised when the Christians entered the city. A fierce contest also arose about the crown of Jerusalem, which
Philip wished to be given to Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, while <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> swore that it should not be taken from his friend Guy, who had hitherto borne it in right of the heiress his wife, now lately dead. The French king, disgusted, left his army, and after taking an oath not to do anything to
<persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s hurt till he came back, sailed for France, July 31.</p>
   <p><persName key="Saladin">Saladin</persName> the Turkish Sultan would not agree to the terms
 of the surrender, but slew all his Christian prisoners; so
 <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> did the like, and made ready to go up to retake
 Jerusalem, though the plague, which was raging at Acre and
 had killed <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> of Glanville and many other noblemen,
 had terribly thinned his army. On the march down the
 coast <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> was attacked by the Saracens and gained a
 battle at Arsouf September 7, and won another on his way
 to Jerusalem, November 6. He reached Ramla, but was
 foolishly advised to fall back to Ascalon in January <date value ="1192">1192</date>.
 All now agreed to make Conrad King of Jerusalem, but the
 Old Man of the Mountain, who ruled in Lebanon, shortly
 sent two of his Assassins to slay him because he had offended
 him; so <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName>, Earl of Champagne, was chosen to succeed
 him, and <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> gave Guy the realm of Cyprus in exchange.
 In June the king again marched on Jerusalem and got as
 far as Beit-nuba, when hearing that a caravan sent by
 <persName key="Saladin">Saladin</persName> from Cairo with provisions and arms was on the
 way to Jerusalem, he fell upon its armed guard of 11,000
 men with 5000 of his chosen troops, put most of them to the
 sword, and won a great booty, besides 3000 camels and 4000
 packhorses and mules. But the French crusaders would
 go no farther lest it should be said that an English king
 recovered the Holy Sepulchre. <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> was sorely grieved
 at failing so near the goal, and when one of his knights
 begged him to come to a part of the camp whence he could
 see Jerusalem, he snapped the switch he held in his hand
 in twain and cast his surcoat over his head, praying with
 angry tears, <q type="spoken">"O Lord God, suffer not mine eyes to behold
 Thy Holy City, since Thou wilt not suffer me to deliver it out
 of the hands of Thine enemies."</q> When he got back to the
 coast he fell ill again, after driving <persName key="Saladin">Saladin</persName> from before Joppa;
 but by the goodwill of the Sultan's brother Safeddin a truce
 for three years, three months, three days, and three hours
 was made with the Saracens, during which time trade was
 to go on peacefully and the Christians were to be free to



<pb id="p.115" n="115"/>
 visit Jerusalem and the holy places. <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> feeling that he could do no more for the Cross, and having bad news from England, left Acre October 8. His fleet got back safely, but he landed at Ragusa, meaning to pass through
Germany in disguise with a few followers, and was seized near Vienna by his old foe the Austrian duke, and sold to the emperor, who put him in chains, charging him with murdering his kinsman Conrad, taking Cyprus from his ally
Isaac, insulting his vassal Leopold, and helping his enemy
Tancred.</p>
  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="3">English affairs, <dateRange from="1191" to="1194">1191-1194</dateRange>.</note>Meanwhile things had not gone smoothly in England.
The Justiciar, though a faithful minister, offended the
English barons by his foreign ways, new officers, and proud behaviour; for he went about with a train of 1500 men, kept a band of minstrels, and was waited upon by nobles and gentlemen like a prince.  When he tried to replace the castellan of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> by one of his own men, though peace was patched up at a council at <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, on
Earl <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> took up arms against him, and the understanding that he should support <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s claims to the crown (for <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s health was not very good), it did not last long. For William's soldiers seized Archbishop
Geoffrey from before the altar at <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> Church and haled him to prison bareheaded through the muddy streets. The earl of course took up his brother's cause, called a Great Council at London, where he was the favourite of the people, and though the Justiciar held out bravely for some time in the
Tower, forced him to yield, changed the ministry, and banished him from the realm. He fled to <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> and tried to escape from the people in the disguise of a cloth-wife, but he was found out, mobbed and plundered before he could get away.  Walter, Archbishop of Rouen, who brought letters from the king bidding him, if need were, take his place, now became Justiciar.  Both sides used excommunication, till the Pope and Queen Eleanor, just returned from Sicily, stopped the quarrel. Philip, who was back in
France, full of rage against <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, tried to win over Earl
<persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>; but Eleanor interposed, and the French nobles would not follow their king in an invasion of Normandy. The powerful Hugh of Puiset and Archbishop Geoffrey now fell out and gave great trouble, while a rebellion arose in
Aquitaine, and William of <placeName key="Ely">Ely</placeName> came back suddenly to
England, having bought <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s consent.  The ministers were hard pressed, they gave <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> a higher bribe to banish
William, and when the captivity of <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> was known and

 the traitor earl went over to Philip promising to marry his sister Alice if he would help him to win the crown, they withstood him like men, garrisoning the seaports and coasts so that the French and Flemings and others who had promised the earl their help dare not attack England.  The
Earl of Leicester and the burgesses of Rouen held their own against Philip in Normandy.</p>
  <p><persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> was tried at a Great Council at Haguenau after
Easter <date value ="1193">1193</date>, where he spoke well and boldly, and cleared himself of all the charges against him. His ransom was fixed at 150,000 marks, and he wrote home to beg his ministers to gather it as soon as possible, for he wished to get back to his dominions. So they taxed every man, clerk or lay, one-fourth of his year's rents and his movables, levied
20s. from every knight's fee, and took the year's wool from the Cistercian and Sempringham monks, whose riches lay in herds of sheep; even the silver chalices were taken from the churches in many places to make up the sum.
  About this time <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, who whiled away his prison hours by making poetry, sent this ballad to his favourite sister, Joan, who with his wife Berengar had shared all his perils in the Holy Land:-

  <p>In December, by counsel of his mother (who was of the greatest help at this time by her wise advice), <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> gave up his kingdom to the Emperor Henry, handing him his cap as a sign of surrender. And the emperor gave him it back along with a new fief, the kingdom of Burgundy, by the token of a double cross of gold, on condition of his doing homage for both realms and paying a yearly rent of
50000. Philip, who had tried in vain to get the Danish king to invade England, and <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, who met a stout resistance from his mother, did all they could to persuade Henry to detain <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>; but the German princes, the Pope, and the other Christian powers were indignant at the ill-usage which the champion of the Cross had suffered, and he was set free.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="4">The end of <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s reign, <dateRange from="1194" to="1199">1194-1199</dateRange>.</note>Landing at Sandwich in his galley Trenche-Mer, 20th
<date value="1194-03-20">March 1194</date>, <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> at once marched to Nottingham, which was in the hands of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s partisans, took it and held a
Great Council there, at which the earl and his friends were declared to have forfeited their lands and summoned to trial for treason, and a heavy taxation, 2s. from  every plough-land of 120 acres, and a third of the rent of every knight's fee [ &#x00A3; 20], levied for that part of the ransom that was still unpaid.  The king was then crowned again at
<placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, to wash off the stain of his captivity, and giving the realm to the charge of the
Justiciar, Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, nephew of <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> Glanville, left England for the last time. When he got to Normandy his brother came to him to beg his forgiveness, and he forgave him at the prayer of his mother. The French and English kings were now at open war, <quote>"playing at castle-taking,"</quote> as the chronicler says, till a defeat at Frette- Val, July 15, where Philip hardly escaped with the loss of all the records of France, which always travelled with him, brought on a truce.</p>
  <p>While <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> was away the Justiciar William had given a fresh charter to the city of London, empowering the burghers [householders] to choose their own port-reeve, who was now called mayor, and to assess the taxes and city-rent themselves. Now that large sums had to be paid to meet the king's needs, the householders, to spare their own purses, made the poor craftsmen and labourers, who had no vote at the husting [householders' Moot], which governed the city, pay all. Whereon there arose a certain lawyer, well known for his gallant behaviour in the Crusade, William of the
Beard, the son of Osbert, who, burning with zeal for righteousness and fair-play, made himself the champion of the

 poor, holding that every man, poor or rich, should pay his share of the city's burdens according to his means. Fifteen thousand men soon banded themselves by oath to him, and he laid their grievances before the king, who was not unfavourable to his views. But the Justiciar Hubert and the aldermen were frightened at this league, and at William's bold speeches at public meetings, and tried to arrest him; but he seized an axe from one of his assailants and slew him, and fled with a few friends to S. Mary-le-Bow Church for sanctuary, for no man could be lawfully arrested in such holy places. The
Justiciar, however, set fire to the church and he was forced to sally out, when the son of the man he had slain stabbed him at the door, and he was seized, tried at the Tower, condemned, dragged thence half dead on a hide to the gallows at the Elms, and hanged there the same day with nine of his followers. But the people honoured him as a martyr for freedom and right, and the Justiciar was charged with causing bloodshed in a church.</p>
  <p>In <date value ="1197">1197</date> <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s troubles in Aquitaine were ended by the marriage of his sister Joan to Raymond of S. Giles, and he got the help of the Earls of Flanders and Champagne against Philip. The Bretons too, though they would not give him charge of their young Duke Arthur, his nephew, were willing to support him in arms. Several battles were fought before a truce was made. In one of these Philip,
Bishop of Beauvais, was taken prisoner. The Pope wrote bidding <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> let him go free, but the king sent back the blood-stained coat of mail in which the bishop had fought, with the words, <quote>" Know now whether this be thy son's coat or no,"</quote> whereby the Pope, seeing that the bishop had broken the Church Law which forbade the clergy to bear arms, took his part no more.  While the truce lasted
<persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> busied himself with building a splendid fortress on the Rock of Andelys by Seine, to stop the French invasions. It was better planned and stronger than any other castle, and when it was finished within twelve months, the king cried, <q type="spoken">" Is not this a fine saucy year-old baby of mine?"</q> Whence it is still called Chateau Gaillard [Saucy
Castle].</p>
   <p>Wars and castle-building are, however, costly, and Hubert
 was obliged to call a council at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> I 98, and ask the
 English bishops and barons to furnish the king with 300
 knights and their keep for a year, for his French war. Most
 assented, but Hugh of Avalon, Bishop of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, stood up
 and said, <quote>"Ye know well my lords, that I am a stranger in

 this land, one called from the plain life of a hermit to be bishop. But when Our Lady's Church of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> was given into my unskilled hands, I set about learning what its rights and burdens were, and these thirteen years I have walked in all the ways of my forerunners. I know very well that this church is bound to furnish knights for the king's service in
England, but not for service abroad. And I will go back at once to my old hermit's life rather than lay fresh burdens on this bishopric committed to my charge."</quote> This speech, from such a holy man, led to the withdrawal of Hubert's plan; but a fresh survey of England was taken by the oaths of juries before two commissioners in each county to find out how much tilled land there was, and a tax of five shillings was laid on every carucate [100 acres of plough-land]. The monks would not pay it, however, till the king ordered that no monk should be able to go to law against any layman who had wronged him till he paid the tax.  The Pope's displeasure and the charges made against Hubert on all hands led to his being replaced by Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, <date value ="1198">1198</date>.</p>

Soon after the <quote>"weathercock Poitevins,"</quote> always rebellious, rose against <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, who went south to quell the rising, where he heard that Widomar, Viscount of Limoges, had found on one of his farms a large golden chess-table with gold pieces. He claimed this treasure-trove as suzerain, but Widomar would not give it up, so the king beset his castle of Chaluz and stormed the ballium. But a few men held out in the keep, one of whom shot the king in the breast with a quarrel [arblast-arrow], and the bad surgery of his doctor made the wound mortify. Knowing that he must die, <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, when the keep was taken, ordered the crossbowman to be brought before him. <q type="spoken">" What have I done to thee that thou shouldest slay me?"</q> <q type="spoken">"Thou hast slain my father and two of my brothers with thine own hand,"</q> answered the man boldly. <q type="spoken">"Torture me as thou wilt, I shall die gladly since I have slain him who hath done so much ill."</q>
<q type="spoken">"Well, I forgive thee my death,"</q> said <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, and bade his captain Mercade give the man money and let him go.

  <p><persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> was tall, stalwart, and handsome, fair-haired and blue-eyed. No mean general, a skilful engineer, and a wise judge of men, he might have made a good king, but contented himself with being a good knight.  Of reckless bravery, he would peril his life for the sake of adventure, as when he fought with a mob of peasants about a hawk in
Italy, and in the Holy Land his place was ever in the foremost trench at sieges and the first ranks in battle.
Many tales were told of his prowess, how, mounted on his favourite Cyprus Chestnut (killed under him at Jaffa), with his mighty axe or great spear in hand, he led the charge into the midst of the Turkish horse-archers, and even fought hand to hand with <persName key="Saladin">Saladin</persName> himself. The famous French knight, William of Barre, is said to have been the only man he ever found to match him. Fond of show and pleasure, and a poet himself, he was bountiful to poets.  William
Blondel of Nesle, <persName key="de Born, Bertran">Bertran of Born</persName>, who welcomed the king's release from prison with joyous songs, Piers Vidal, the fantastic poet who followed him on his crusade, Arnald Daniel, the wisest of the Provencal poets, Folquet of Marseille, whom Dante met in Paradise, and the gallant Wacelm
Faidit of Avignon,who deeply mourned his patron's death, were his chief favourites. In <date value ="1198">1198</date> a pious priest, Fulk of Neuilly, warned <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> of his faults, bidding him in the Lord's name make haste to marry his wicked daughters. <q type="spoken">" I have no daughters, thou deceiver !"</q> said <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>. <q type="spoken">" Nay, thou hast three, whom thou hast cherished too long: Pride, Greed, and Evil-Living are their names."</q> <q type="spoken">"Then,"</q> said the king,
<q type="spoken">"I can match them well. I will give Pride to the proud
Templars, Greed to the Cistercian monks, and Evil-Living to certain of my bishops."</q> But in spite of this scoff, he took the warning to heart, and began to lead a better life.
  Under <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> the policy and constitution of <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> were faithfully carried on in England by the ministers,William,

  <p>1. Earl <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> now sent Archbishop Hubert and William the Marshal to England to help the Justiciar to take charge of the realm. They held a council, and promising on <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s behalf to right all wrongs and rule righteously, got the barons and people to swear fealty to him.   But the people of Brittany, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine wished
Arthur to be king, and his mother Constance, a foolish, headstrong woman, gave the boy into Philip's charge, who took up his cause.  However, the earl and Queen Eleanor wrested Angers and Maine from the rebels, and on Easter
Day <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> was crowned with the gilt coronet of Normandy by Hugh of Avalon.  He then crossed to England, where on Ascension Day, 27th May, before a great gathering, he took the coronation oaths, Hubert adjuring him in the name of God not to dare take the crown unless he had it in his heart to fulfil the promises he had made.</p>

Blanche of Castile (whom Eleanor, now eighty years old, had herself fetched from Spain to her bridegroom), to the French prince Louis to wife.  But in an evil hour <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> fell in love with Isabel, daughter of the Earl of Angoulesme, who was already espoused to Hugh the
Brown of Lusignan, Earl of Marche, and (putting away his own wife, Hawis of Gloster) married her. This match led to a breach with Philip, who took up the earl's quarrel, and, in <date value ="1202">1202</date>, sent Arthur (whose mother was now dead) with 200
French knights to help the rebellious Poitevins against the
English king. But the old queen, Eleanor, held out in the keep of Mirabel, though Hugh and her grandson had taken the bailey, till the 31st of July, when <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> hurried up to her relief, and driving the besiegers like sheep into the castleyard took Aithur captive, together with his sister Eleanor the Fair Maid of Brittany, Earl Hugh, and nearly all their knights. Arthur was sent to Falaise and the rest thrown into prison. In <date value ="1203">1203</date> <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> offered his nephew fair terms if he would promise to be faithful to him, but the angry lad swore that he would never give his uncle a year's peace till he had won England and the rest of <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>'s inheritance from him; whereon <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, seeing that he could never trust

 him, sent him to the New Tower at Rouen under close guard.
There he died, no man knows how, April <date value ="1203">1203</date>, and Philip straightway summoned the English king to be tried for murder before the Peers of France on the accusation of the Bishop of
Rennes. But as he would not promise him a safe-conduct there and back, <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> refusing to risk himself in his enemy's power, was tried in his absence, found guilty of treason and felony, and sentenced to lose all his French fiefs. Philip further made ready to carry out the judgment, and invaded Normandy. Trusting in his riches and skill as a general, <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> now fell into a strange kind of recklessness, sitting still in
Rouen with his wife, feasting and making merry, and laughing at the news of Philip's successes, which he boasted he could revenge with interest whenever he had a mind to. In vain the poets tried to rouse the <soCalled>" Shameless King"</soCalled> by their satires.

   <p>His barons set his behaviour down to cowardice, some in disgust surrendering their castles at Philip's first summons, while most of the English knights went home without leave, for which <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, who crossed to England to hold his Yule as Hubert's guest at <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, fined them heavily. But though he raised money and gathered men, his faithful lieges over sea got no help. For nearly a year Roger of Lacy, the
Constable of Chester, held the key of Normandy, The Saucy
Castle, against all the French assaults, but in the spring of
<date value ="1204">1204</date> his stores gave out, when, despairing of relief, he tried to cut his way through the besiegers and was taken. Now this great stronghold had fallen, Rouen and the other towns sent a last message to <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, telling him that they must surrender in default of instant succour, but he bade them shift for themselves. The old queen, Eleanor, who had saved them before, fell ill and died, 21st March, and so all hope being gone, one by one they were obliged to make terms.   By
July all Normandy (save the Channel Isles), as well as
Anjou, Touraine, and Maine, were in Philip's hands. No real attempt at a rescue was made till <date value ="1206">1206</date>, for the English barons and <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> distrusted each other, when the king sailed



<pb id="p.123" n="123"/>


 to Rochelle with a large army and took Montauban with his war-engines.  But after four months' campaign he agreed to a truce and went back to England. So the heritage of
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> was lost for ever, and the Angevin princes forced to rule henceforward as English kings, not merely as kings of England.</p>
  <p>2. <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>' quarrel with the Church, <dateRange from="1207" to="1213">1207-1213</dateRange>.In
<date value ="1205">1205</date> died Hubert, the wise archbishop, whose talents as a soldier and architect had won the favour of <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName>, and whose clear statecraft had made him a useful servant to <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>; while his truthfulness and wisdom gained him the respect of the clergy, who had at first looked on him with distrust; and his generosity and even temper compelled the regard of the people, who had dreaded his stern justice. By his advice the king had hitherto, like his father and brother, treated the Church with a fair tongue and a firm hand, and avoided all cause of trouble.  But ere Hubert was buried, the younger party of the monks of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, who claimed the right of choosing the archbishops, met secretly, named their sub-prior Reginald to the office, and sent him to Rome for the pall. The elder monks, fearing lest their rashness might bring evil on the minister, went to <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> and agreed to name the man he should wish. <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> chose one of his ministers,
John of Gray, Bishop of <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName>, a man ill-spoken of as <quote>" a servant of Mammon and an evil shepherd that devoured his own sheep."</quote> Several of the monks were then sent to Rome to beg the Pope to confirm the election. But the bishops, who held that the choice of an archbislop lay with them, not with the monks, appealed to Rome against both claimants. However, Innocent, the most proud and powerful of all the popes, quashed their plea, set aside both
Reginald and <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> as unduly chosen, and made the monks elect his friend, Dr. Stephen Langton, a pious and wise man, whom he consecrated himself at Viterbo, June <date value ="1207">1207</date>.</p>
  <p>The king angrily refused to acknowledge Stephen, drove the monks abroad, and defied the Pope, who, after writing in vain to persuade him to an agreement, on March 23, <date value ="1208">1208</date>, laid an Interdict on the whole realm. No public service could be held, the churches were closed, and the dead were refused burial in the churchyards while it lasted, so that the people were in sore distress. But the king was the more angry, and sent his officers to seize the goods and land of the
Church for his own use, merely leaving the clergy enough for their daily bread. In <date value ="1209">1209</date> Innocent threatened to excommunicate <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> and cast him out of the pale of the Church;


<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>
               <note type="header"  place="head">[<dateRange from="1209" to="1213">1209-1213</dateRange>.]</note>
 when most of the bishops, <quote>"fearing the king, but daring not obey him for dread of the Pope,"</quote> fled abroad till these troubles were past.</p>
  <p>Still <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> would not yield. He made good his position in England by ordering his barons to swear fealty to him afresh and give hostages for their loyalty. With the money he wrung from the Church and the Jews (whom he treated cruelly, imprisoning them and torturing them till they ransomed themselves with their treasure) he raised great numbers of hired troops. Marching north in <date value ="1209">1209</date> he compelled
William the Lion to do homage and pay a heavy tribute. Next year with a fleet of 500 ships he went to Ireland, which was troubled by the quarrels between the Lacies and Courcy in
Ulster, and the lawless behaviour of the outlaws who had fled from England to the Pale, beside the usual Irish wars. By seizing the outlaws, beating the King of Connaught, receiving the oaths of the Irish princes, restoring good laws, and setting good officers in the Pale, he quickly pacified the country, and leaving John of Gray, who, whatever his faults as a churchman, was no mean statesman, as Justiciar, sailed home with his captives in triumph. In
<date value ="1211">1211</date> he forced his son-in-law <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName>, the Welsh prince, to do homage at Snowdon, and sternly punished all outrages done along the Welsh border.</p>
  <p>But now the Pope sent Pandulf, his counsellor, and
Durand, a knight of S. John, to make peace between the king and the archbishop, and they gave the king the Pope's message at a great council at Northampton. And when he refused to listen to their words, Pandulf, in the Pope's name, declared all <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s subjects free from their oaths of fealty to him. Whereon the enemies of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> were glad, the Welsh rose again, and the king was afraid to summon his barons together against them, for he knew that Robert Fitz-Walter the Banner-bearer of London and Eustace of Vesci, with many of the northern barons whom he had set against him by his insulting behaviour, were plotting against him. Still the greater part of the nobles, under the leadership of his brother William Longsword Earl of Salisbury, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter the Justiciar, and Hugh Neville the Grand Forester, a brave old crusader who had slain a lion single-handed in the Holy Land, as well as many of the more worldly clergy, such as <soCalled>"Squire Peter"</soCalled> des Roches Bishop of<placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>; and the Bishops of Bath and Durham, held by him; though his chief trust was in his hired troops and their captains-in
Fawkes of Breaute with his engineers and Flemish men-at-arms,



<pb id="p.125" n="125"/>

 and in Gerard of Athyes, Ingelard of Cigognes, Philip
Mark, and many more with their Gascon arblast-men and knights. Those conspirators who were unable to get away were speedily thrown into prison, and <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> set about pleasing the people by laying down good rules for the seaports' trade, and forgiving offenders against the forest law.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> becomes the Pope'vassal, May 15, <date value ="1213">1213</date>.</note>But the Pope, grieved at the wretched state of England, now gave final sentence that <quote>"<persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> should be thrust from his throne, and that another worthier than he should reign in his stead,"</quote> granting the crown to Philip of France, whom he bade carry out this decree. <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> had already formed a league with his nephew Otho the Emperor (who had also quarrelled with
Innocent), Earl Ferdinand of Flanders, and Reginald Earl of Boulogne against Philip, and both sides gathered their forces.  And now <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> resolved to come to terms with
Innocent, believing that if he could only make peace speedily with the Church, he might crush his rival and win back all he had lost. He was also afraid of dying excommunicate, and frightened at the prophecy of Peter the Wise the
Wakefield Hermit who had foretold that he should lose his crown ere next Ascension Day. Accordingly on May 15th, at Ewell, near <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, where he was lying with a huge host, he received Pandulf, and by advice of his barons agreed to all Innocent's demands, promising to receive Stephen and make good to the clergy all the damage they had undergone.
Moreover, he gave up his kingdom to the Pope, taking it back as a fief, for which he was to pay homage and a yearly rent of 1000 marks.</p>
  <p>Before the Pope's absolution could arrive William Longsword and the Earl of Boulogne attacked the French fleet lying at Damme, ready to invade England, took 300 ships and all the stores, and burned the rest, so putting an end to
Philip's carefully-laid plans. However, the English nobles, ill-pleased at the behaviour of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s ministers and hired soldiers, and worn down by the heavy taxes which he laid upon them, refused under different excuses to go with him to France to follow up this splendid success.</p>
  <p>In July Stephen landed and absolved the king at Winchester, giving him the coronation oaths again.  He also persuaded him  not to punish the disobedient northern barons, while at S. Albans (4th August) Geoffrey the
Justiciar promised that the laws of King <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> I. should be kept henceforward and all injustices swept away.  On the 25th August the archbishop read the charter of <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> I.


<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>

 to a gathering of barons at S. Paul's, telling them that if they stood by it they would soon win back all the rights they had let drop, and promising to help them. They were pleased with his words, and swore to stand by their rights to the death, and Geoffrey laid their wishes before the king.
A council was then called at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, to which not only those barons and knights who held their lands directly of the king were to come, but also four gentlemen chosen from each county to talk with him about the needs and business of the country.  Soon after this died the Justiciar, <quote>"a most steadfast pillar of the realm, a man of high birth, well skilled in the law, rich, and of great possessions, and knit to the greatest nobles in England by blood or friendship, wherefore the king feared him above all other men, and he was able to hold the reins of the realm." </quote> When <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> heard of his faithful servant's death he laughed, and said with an oath,
<q type="spoken">" Let him greet his friend Hubert in hell, for now they are both gone, I am for the first time king indeed!"</q> and he gave the justiciarship to his favourite, <soCalled>"Squire Peter."</soCalled> For the time the nobles were uncertain what to do, and the clergy were divided; for when the legate Nicolas came in
November to take off the Interdict and receive the king's homage, he filled the vacant sees and abbacies with the king's friends, and took the king's part against Archbishop
Stephen.</p>
  <p>So, though his barons were still stubborn, <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> gathered a great hired force and sailed to La Rochelle early in <date value ="1214">1214</date>, meaning to put down a rebellion in Poitou and attack
Philip from the west, while his nephew the Emperor Otho, the Flemish earls, and William Longsword should invade
France on the east. <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> was successful on his side, and
Prince Louis retreated before him. On the east the allies marched as far as the bridge of Bovines, where Philip met them with his knights and the militia levies, a fine body of footmen, who had marched up from the towns and villages under their parish priests. He pitched his camp for the night, barricading his front with baggage and waggons.
Next morning, Sunday, July 27, Earl Reginald and Otho were unwilling to attack; but they were overruled, and the allied army was drawn up for battle in three divisions. In the first were the English and Flemings under the Earls of
Salisbury, Flanders, and Boulogne; in the second the Brabanters led by Hugh of Boves, and the Hollanders by their duke William; and in the third the Germans under the
Emperor himself. The earls led the attack and pressed on



<pb id="p.127" n="127"/>


 hotly, fighting their way through the barricade to the French king, who was struck down and all but slain by Earl
Reginald; but the French militia swarmed round them, and after a hard fight they were cut off and made prisoners, the Bishop of Beauvais striking down and seizing William of Salisbury with his own hand. Philip and his knights then pushed on in triumph, routed Duke William and Hugh, driving them from the field, and fell with all their force upon the third division of the allied army.  But though he had three horses killed under him, Otho scorned to surrender, and laid about him so fiercely with his sharp two-handed sword that at length the French gave up the attack and let him withdraw his troops in good order. This defeat led to
Otho's fall, and forced <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> to make a hasty peace with
Philip and go back to England baffled and exhausted to face his discontented subjects.</p>
  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="2">The Great Charter, June 1,<date value ="1215">1215</date>. </note>The northern barons and the archbishop saw that their time was come, and meeting at S.
Edmund's Minster, November 20, under colour of a pilgrimage, the nobles swore at the high altar to throw off their allegiance and take up arms unless the king pledged himself to allow their rights in a charter under seal; agreeing to present their terms to him at Christmas, and meanwhile to furnish themselves with horses and arms.   When <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> heard their request at
Christmas, he was afraid, and asked them to wait till Easter, for the matter was weighty, and they agreed to this. Meanwhile he busied himself in trying to win over the clergy by granting them free right to choose their own bishops, and to check the barons by asking them to swear fresh oaths of allegiance, and by taking the Cross, which would shelter him from armed attack; he also prayed the Pope to help his faithful vassal. But all availed nothing, at Easter the northern league and the archbishop, who were now joined by most of the other English nobles, met at Stamford, March 19, in number 2000 armed knights, besides men-at-arms and foot-soldiers in great force, and sent to <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> a list of Articles which they wished him to sign. But he refused with an angry oath. <q type="spoken">"These Articles are pure foolishness !
Why do they not ask me for the kingdom at once ? I will never give them such freedom as would make me their slave!"</q></p>
  <p>Thus rebuffed, the barons flew to arms, and having chosen
Robert Fitz-Walter as general, naming him <soCalled>" Marshal of the

 the burgesses gladly received them, May 24. Hence they wrote to William  the Marshal, William Longsword, Randulf
Earl of Chester, the Earls of Warrenne, Albemarle, and
Cornwall, Hugh Neville, and the other ministers who still held by the king, bidding them join them  at once unless they wished to be treated as foes.  Their summons was quickly obeyed, and <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> found himself alone with his hired soldiers against the whole English baronage.  He could not but yield, and on June 15 he met the barons at <placeName key="Runnymead">Runnymead</placeName>, between Staines and Windsor, and sealed <hi rend="italics">the Great
Charter of the Liberties of England</hi>.</p>
   <p>By this Charter, founded upon that of <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> I. and sworn to by the king and the whole of the prelates and barons-
  a. The full rights and liberties of the Church are acknowledged.
  b. The feudal rights of the king over his vassals, and of these vassals over their tenants, are limited and settled.
  c. No scutage or aid (save for the ransom of the king, the knighting of his eldest son, and the first marriage of his eldest daughter) is to be levied save by the Common Council of the realm, specially called, by separate writs [letters] to the bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, and general writs through the sheriffs and bailiffs to all who held directly of the king.
  The free rights of London and the other chartered towns are allowed.
  d. The harsh law of debts to the king and the Jews is made milder.
  A court of Common Pleas [cases between subjects] is fixed at Westminster.
  Cases touching the ownership of land are to be tried in the counties by the justices in eyre.
  Vexatious appeals are forbidden, and the conduct and appointment of the king's judges, sheriffs, and officers strictly regulated.
  No free man is to be taken, imprisoned, ousted of his land, outlawed, banished, or hurt in any way save by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.
  No free man is to be fined beyond his offence or means or without trial.
  Englishmen and foreigners are to have free right to pass in and out of England in time of peace.
  The king is neither to sell, put off, or deny right or justice to any one.
  e. An inquiry into the Forest Laws is promised.
  The foreign soldiers, Gerard of Athyes, Ingelard of Cigognes, and all the gang that came with horses and arms to the hurt of the realm, are to be sent out of the country.
  Right is to be done to <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName>, Prince of Wales, and <persName key="Alexander III.">Alexander</persName>, King of Scots, who had sided with the barons.
  All past ill will and offences arising from the struggle are forgiven.
  In a supplementary document, called Secutitas Pacis, twenty-five
Sworn Guardians chosen from among the barons were appointed to watch over the keeping of the Charter, being empowered to demand the instant putting right of any breach of its articles, and, in default, allowed to make war on the king till the matter should be settled to their pleasure.</p>
  <p>The Twenty-five chosen were seven earls-Clare, Albemarle, Gloster,



<pb id="p.129" n="129"/>



<placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, Hereford, Norfolk, and <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>; the chief of the younger barons--Robert Fitz-Walter, Gilbert Clare, Hugh Bigod, John Fitz-Robert,
William Mallet, and William, son of the Marshal; Eustace of
Vesci, and four other northerln barons-Percy, Mowbray, Ros, and Lacy; the Mayor of London, and the lords of Lanvalay, Say, Mumbazon,
Huntingfield, Montfichet, and Albiney.</p>

  <p>This great table of laws, won by the people of England from a tyrannous king, was the first Act which laid down in black and white the main points of the Constitution and the several rights and duties of king and people.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="3">Wretched end of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s reign, <dateRange from="1215" to="1216">1215-1216</dateRange>.</note>
<persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> never meant to abide by the Charter, but his rage at having been forced to yield was terrible. He at once sent over the sea for more hired troops, and wrote secretly to bid Fawkes and Philip Mark, and the other foreign captains, to whom he chiefly trusted, to store and arm the castles they still held for him against their coming. He also appealed to the Pope against the Charter as won by force and against the overlord's interests.</p>
  <p>Innocent warmly took his part, ordered Archbishop
Stephen to Rome, freed <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> from his oaths, and threatened to excommunicate the barons if they persisted in rebellion.</p>
 <p> Soon bands of hired soldiers, thirsty for blood and gold, and caring little for aught else, came flocking to the royal banner.  There were Savary of Mauleon the poet-baron and his Poitevin knights, Walter Buck and his Brabanters, Godshalk of Saxony with his crossbowmen; and many more, though the cruel Hugh of Boves, with a whole colony of Flemings, to whom the king had given Norfolk and
Suffolk to dwell in, were shipwrecked and drowned to the great joy of the East English.</p>
  <p>Thoroughly roused, <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> showed skill and quickness, seized Rochester, while the barons lay feasting and jousting at London, and hurried north with William of Albemarle and Godshalk to drive <persName key="Alexander III.">Alexander</persName> King of Scots from Northumberland, which the barons had promised him, and to lay waste the northern rebels' lands, leaving Fawkes, Savary, and
Walter Buck to watch London. Burning, plundering, and wasting all before him, <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> reached Berwick and took it, swearing he would drive the red fox [<persName key="Alexander III.">Alexander</persName>] from his earth, then turned south again. Fawkes meanwhile harried the midlands, and the barons made raids on the home counties to get food and stores for their needs. Wherever the troops came the country-folk fled, for the Flemings slew the poor-men, women, and children-and tortured the rich to make them give up their money, while some of the English nobles,

 reckless under the Pope's ban and the fear of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s vengeance, behaved little better.</p>
  <p>In despair the barons, March <date value ="1216">1216</date>, offered the crown to
Louis the French prince, who in spite of the commands of
Walo, the Pope's legate, landed at Stonor, May 21. <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> broke up his camp at <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, for fear of treachery from his foreign hirelings, and leaving Hubert of Burgh (a good and true knight who had been his seneschal in Poitou) to keep the castle, retreated westward. Louis was joyfully welcomed to London, where the barons paid him homage. He was shortly joined by many Flemish deserters, by the King of Scots, and not a few who had hitherto held with John
-Hugh Neville, the Earls of Warrenne and Arundel, and even William Longsword; and Lynn, <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, Cambridge, and <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> yielded to him.  But Windsor held out, 1000 <placeName key="Sussex">Sussex</placeName> yeomen under Wilkin the Archer took to the woods and harassed his army, the Cinque Ports' fleet burned his ships, and he could not win <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>; nay, when
William Longsword came to the gate and told Hubert that
Louis had sworn to hang his brother Thomas de Burgh
(whom  he had captured) unless he yielded, the stout castellan rebuked the earl as traitor to his king and kinsman, and threatened to shoot him if he said more. In
September, having got help from the Welsh border, where he had ruled best, <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> marched swiftly across the midlands, resolved to bring matters to a speedy issue, retook Lynn and
<placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> (where he was well-liked by the merchants and sailors), and set out for London. As they crossed the Wash, by some ill-hap his baggage and treasure were swallowed in a quicksand. The king himself having narrowly escaped, fell ill at Swineshead Abbey (where he lay next night, October
12), whether of poison, as some say, or, as others think, of grief and rage at his loss. Still he pressed on, and paying no heed to his health, but gorging himself with peaches and new cider, he grew worse and worse, and died at Newark,
October 19, bequeathing his soul to God and his body to
S. Wulfstan, in whose minster at Worcester it was honourably buried.</p>

Well-read, well-trained, a good general, a cunning statesman, knowing how to profit by men's weaknesses, succeeding to a united realm and a body of capable servants, with a successful policy clearly marked out for him, an honest man with half his brains might have ruled gloriously, but <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s wicked selfishness met its due reward, and in spite of his well-laid plans and mighty power, he was forced to humble himself to the Pope, whom he scorned and defied, to the rival whom he loathed and despised, and to the subjects whom he had insulted and betrayed.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV: Henry III of Winchester 1216-1272</head>

       
  <p>1. William the Marshal, with the Earls of Chester and
Derby, Savary, Fawkes, and the foreign captains, by the advice of Bishop Peter and Walo the Pope's legate (who had come to England to help <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> against Louis), now had
<persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>, <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s eldest son, a child of nine years, crowned at the King's Hall in Gloster, October 28. William was made warden of the king and kingdom, and a council was summoned at <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName>, where the Great Charter, save a few articles left for future settlement, was confirmed by the king and legate.  Few of the English barons who had hated
<persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> bore illwill to his child, and many feared Louis' rule.
It was said that the Viscount of Melun, a French noble who had lately died in London, had revealed on his deathbed to those about him an oath taken by Louis and sixteen of his barons to banish all the English nobles who had left their king, as unworthy of trust. When it was seen that earldoms and castles were being bestowed on foreigners, and that
Englishmen's rights were passed over, this story was believed. So on Louis going to France for a little while to gather fresh troops, the Earls of Salisbury, Warrenne,
Arundel, with others came and did homage to <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>.
When the prince came back he sent the Earl of Perche, the best young knight in Christendom, and Robert Fitz-Walter,


<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>
           <note type="header"  place="head"><date value="1217">[1217.</date></note>
 with 3 earls, 500 knights, and 20,000 footmen, all greedy for plunder, to beset <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> Castle, which Nicola of Camville still held for <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>. They took up their quarters in the town, and set to work to batter the fortress with their stone-casters and great war-slings. William the Marshal, Randulf of Chester, and the renowned Fawkes with 400 knights and 250 crossbowmen, hurried up to relieve it, and Walo laid the Pope's ban on Louis and all his partisans.  <note place="foot" n="1">Louis is obliged to leave England, <date value ="1217">1217</date>. </note>When the king's army drew nigh Robert Fitz-Walter wished to fight them outside the city, but the Earl of Perche would not listen to him, and merely closing the gates, went on with the siege.  The
Marshal and his knights attacked the north gate, but Nicola secretly let Fawkes and his crossbowmen into the castle.
The barons were surprised by a shower of cross-bow bolts, from the walls, which laid many of them low, and killed their horses like swine.  Before they could rally Fawkes made a furious sally upon them, while the Marshal, who had forced the town gate, attacked them in the rear. Cooped up in the narrow streets between two foes, the English barons, seeing no hope of escape or victory, gave up their swords; but the Earl of Perche swore he would never sur render to a traitor Englishman, and fought till the Earl
Marshal slew him with his own hand. The rest of the
Frenchmen now fled, but few escaped the vengeance of the
English peasants, who killed all they could find. Fawkes and his men, encouraged by the legate to punish the disobedient clergy who had sided with the barons, plundered town and cathedral, and so great was their easily-won booty that the battle was long known as the Fair of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>.</p>
  <p>Louis now left <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, which he was again besieging, and fell back on London to await the fleet which his faithful wife,
Blanche, had equipped with stores and 300 knights to help him. As soon as Hubert de Burgh, whom <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> had made
Justiciar before he died, heard that the fleet had sailed, he sent to Bishop Peter saying, <quote>"If this host land the realm is lost. Let us meet them at sea, for the Lord is with us, and they are under His ban!"</quote> But Peter answered, <quote>"We are not sailors or fishermen. Go yourself and die."</quote> Hubert hastily got together about forty vessels from the Cinque Ports, and put to sea on S. Bartholomew's Day, 24th August, with
Richard, a base son of King <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, the faithful Philip of
Albiney with his crossbowmen, and a few more brave knights. Before he went on board he was shriven by his chaplain Luke, and gave solemn charge to those he left to

 keep <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>. <quote>" I beseech you, by our Lord's blood, if I be taken, to let them hang me before your eyes rather than give up this castle to any Frenchman, for it is the key of England."</quote> He held towards Calais till he got the weather-gauge of the French fleet, not far from Sandwich, when he bore down on them, though they were at least eighty sail, as fast as a fair breeze could take him. The English were quickly within range, and began to shower arrows and cast quick-lime down the wind into their enemies' faces, while they, shooting against the wind, could do little hurt. When they got alongside the French ships, Hubert bade his men board the enemy and cut away their rigging and sheets, so that masts, sails, and yards soon came rattling down about the
Frenchmen's ears, and, caught like birds in a net, they were easily overcome. Hubert gave them all quarter save their commander Eustace the Monk, a famous pirate who had once been in <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s service but had deserted him.  He offered a great sum for his life, but Richard Fitz-John said,
<quote>"Thou wicked traitor, thou shalt deceive no man again with thy false words ! "</quote> and cut off his head. When Hubert sailed into <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> harbour, towing the French ships behind him, the people and clergy met him with crosses and banners, singing psalms and praising God for this wonderful victory; but Louis was more grieved at the news than he had been for his loss at <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, for his last hope of succour was gone.</p>
  <p>The Marshal now blockaded London, and the French prince willingly came to terms with him and Walo, who earnestly wished to be rid of him. By the treaty of Lambeth,
September 11, Louis promised to give up all the lands that he or his had won in England, to go to France with his men, never to come back as a foe, and to try and make his father give up the lands he had seized from <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>. He also swore obedience to the Pope before the legate. The king, the
Marshal, and Walo agreed to set free all prisoners, and give the barons back their lands and all the liberties laid down in the charter. <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> further gave Louis 1000 marks for his pains, and he in all good love went home to France.</p>
  <p>Walo now punished the clergy who had disobeyed the
Pope's orders, making some pay heavy fines, and taking others' benefices away to give to his own followers. The
Marshal had the Charter confirmed again with some new articles-</p>
 <p> <quote>Forbidding wrongful grants of land by under tenants to monks' houses or others.

<p>He further put forth the Forest Charter promised by <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, which-

  	<p>Randulf, Earl of Chester, Robert Fitz-Walter, Saer, Earl
  of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, Savary, with other barons of both parties went
  off next year to join the Crusaders in Egypt, where they did
  valiantly. In the midst of the peace he had won, <date value ="1219">1219</date>, full of
  years and honours, William the Marshal died. Gaining the
  earldoms of Pembroke and Leicester by his marriage with
  Isabel, <persName key="Strongbow, Richard">Strongbow</persName>'s daughter, he had, as the friend and servant
  of the <soCalled>"young king"</soCalled> and the brothers <persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> and <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>,
  ever shown skill, courage, and faithfulness; but the statesmanship by which, within a few months, he had ousted the French
  prince, brought the king and the legate to confirm the charter,
  and ended a bitter and lengthened civil war, had earned him
  the thanks of every Englishman.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The wise rule of <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert of Burgh</persName>, <dateRange from="1219" to="1232">1219-1232</dateRange>.</note>Bishop
  Peter now took charge of the boy-king, while
 <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>, by the help of Pandulf, who followed
 Walo as legate, governed the kingdom. He
 had the greatest trouble with the <quote>"king's friends,"</quote>
  led by Bishop Peter, many of whom, <quote>"having long lived by
  pillaging their neighbours, could hardly keep their hands
  from the spoil,"</quote> and refused to give up the castles and lands
  trusted to them during the war till <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> should be of age.
  In <date value ="1221">1221</date> the Earl of Albemarle seized Fotheringay, a castle
  of Earl Randulf; but Pandulf excommunicated him and his
  friends, and <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> took his stronghold Biham, so he sued
  for peace and forgiveness, which, because of his former good
  services, were granted him.</p>
    <p>In <date value ="1222">1222</date> there was trouble in London. At a wrestling
  match near the abbey, between the champions of London
  and Westminster, the abbot's steward, with a band of armed
  partisans, treacherously set upon the defenceless Londoners
  who had come out to see the match, and drove them, beaten
  and wounded, into the city. A meeting was quickly called
  to settle how this cowardly assault was to be punished. The
  mayor, Serlo the Mercer, wished to ask the abbot for
  damages, but <persName key="Constantine">Constantine</persName>, Ethelwulfs' son, a rich and well-liked



<pb id="p.135" n="135"/>


 burgess, urged that the citizens should turn out in arms and pull down the houses and buildings of the abbot and his steward, and this plan was carried. With shouts of
<quote>"Mountjoy !"</quote> [the French war-cry,] <quote>"God help us and our
Lord Louis !"</quote> <persName key="Constantine">Constantine</persName> led an armed mob to Westminster, where they destroyed the abbot's palace.  As soon as
<persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> heard of it, he sent for Fawkes and his soldiers, marched to the Tower, and called on the chief citizens to answer for their treasonable and riotous behaviour. Constantine told him openly, <q type="spoken">"I take on me what has been done, and it is less than I wished;"</q> whereon he was doomed to death without more ado, and hanged early next morning, with his nephew and Geoffrey his follower, before the citizens could rescue them. The other ringleaders were maimed, the mayor and aldermen changed, and the city fined. However, Louis complained that his friends had been hardly dealt with, and next year, when he became king, not only refused to give up Normandy, but even seized Poitou.</p>
  <p>Archbishop Stephen was now come home again, and by his help <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> determined, in spite of Peter's angry outcry, to make the barons give up the royal castles. He therefore got letters from the Pope (who was very desirous of doing his best for England and for his young vassal) declaring <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> of age, and bidding all who held charge of royal strongholds or lands give them up at once on pain of his curse. Thus outwitted, and fearing Stephen's threats, they came to Northampton, <date value ="1223">1223</date>, and one by one gave up charge to the king.</p>
  <p>Next year <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> got rid of Fawkes, who was as troublesome in peace as he was helpful in war. He was found guilty at Dunstable assizes of seizing the lands of thirty-two yeomen at Luton and heavily fined. In his rage he carried off one of the judges, Henry of Braybrook, an old foe of his, and put him in chains in Bedford Castle, under the keeping of his brother, William of Breaute, while he hurried west to try and bring Earl Randulf and others of the king's friends who bore no goodwill to <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> to rise with him. The judge's wife went to Northampton (where a great council was being held to talk over the Normandy and Poitou business), and with tears prayed for justice before the whole meeting. Putting aside all else, the king and all the council at once set off to
Bedford. William of Breaute would neither give up his prisoner nor the castle, saying that he was his brother's vassal, not the king's, and as the fortress was very strong (Fawkes having lately rebuilt it), he was able to hold out two months

<note type="header"  place="head">[<dateRange from="1224" to="1232">1224-1232</dateRange>.]</note>
 in spite of the archbishop's curse and the king's oath to hang the garrison unless they surrendered. But wall after wall fell, sapped by the miners and battered by the engine bullets, and on August 5 the keep was stormed and the judge set free.
Fearing lest Bishop Peter, Fawkes' friend, might win the king to break his oath, <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> had William and twenty-three of his men hanged at once while <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> was at dinner. Fawkes, finding no help, now gave himself up. All his castles and lands were taken away, his wife, an heiress whom he had carried off by force, divorced from him, and he was doomed to banishment. With some money he had managed to save he went to Rome to beg the Pope to speak for him; but when the legate Otho asked <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> to undo the judgments against him, he answered, <quote>" Fawkes was fairly tried and sentenced, and I am bound to uphold the law."</quote> In <date value ="1227">1227</date>, poor and friendless, the once <quote>"mighty captain and good friend of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> "</quote> died of poison at S. Cyriac.</p>
  <p>In the same year <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> dismissed Bishop Peter from his office, saying that as he was of age he no longer needed a guardian, and put all his trust in <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>, whom he made
Earl of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>. But while he took this wise step he was foolish enough to destroy the Forest Charter (as being against his interest and granted while he was under age), and to deny his brother Richard a trial in a dispute about a manor.
However, Richard, who had been made Earl of Cornwall and Poitou in <date value ="1225">1225</date>, and sent to Gascony, where he had ruled well and defeated the French, was upheld by the nobles, who met in arms under Earl Randulf and William Williamson, the Marshal (who had married the king's sister Eleanor), and forced <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> to do him justice. <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> always wished for peace, because he knew the risks and cost of war, and saw, from his defeats in the petty Welsh forays, that <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> would never make a good soldier; so when the Gascons and
Normans and discontented French barons begged the king to attack France and win back his heritage, he counselled delay. But the satires of Savary and the Southern barons, and the messages of the Earl of Brittany, seem to have stung
<persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> to act in <date value ="1229">1229</date>, and he called a great host together to
Portsmouth at Mich&#x00E6;lmas. When they came to embark, there were not half enough ships for them. In high displeasure <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> turned on <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>, <q type="spoken">"Thou old traitor! the
French queen hath bribed thee to upset my plans ! "</q> and drew his sword to slay him. But Randulf got the Justiciar out of the room, and the Earl of Brittany told the king that he had better wait till next year to invade France; so his anger was



<pb id="p.137" n="137"/>

 cooled, and he was reconciled with his minister. Next spring he crossed to Brittany, and marched through Anjou and
Poitou to Gascony, where he was blithely welcomed. Still
<persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> would not let him risk a battle, so after spending much money to little end, he came home, leaving Randulf and the Marshal, with 5000 knights and 1000 mercenaries, to bring the war to an end, which they did by beating King
Louis and settling a truce in <date value ="1231">1231</date>.</p>
   <p><persName key="Gregory IX.">Pope Gregory</persName> was at this time warring against the
 <title>Emperor</title> <persName key="Frederick I.">Frederick</persName>, and he called on all Christians for a
 tenth of their income to help him. <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> was willing
 enough, but the barons flatly refused to bind themselves by
 paying tax to Rome, though the clergy, fearing the Pope's
 curse, paid it, save on Earl Randulf's estates, for he stood
 out like a man and forbade his clergy to send a single penny
 to the Pope. Honorius had formerly offered to hear appeals
 without fee if he were allowed a certain number of livings in
 England, which was refused. Yet Gregory went on thrusting
 Italians into English livings against the law, till in <date value ="1231">1231</date> a
 number of gentry and clergy banded themselves together
 under Robert of Twenge (who called himself William
 Wither), and with <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>'s secret approval, forbade tithes to
 be paid to Rome, and carried off all the rents and corn of
 Gregory's Italians to give to the poor. The king, however,
 stopped these doings, and sent Robert to complain to the
 Pope himself.</p>
   <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">Peter des Roches and the aliens,<dateRange from="1232" to="1234">1232-1234</dateRange>.</note>All
 was now quiet, but Bishop Peter, who had come
 home after a five years' crusade, was trying to
 turn the tables on <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> by working on the
 king, who was always too ready to distrust his
 friends and listen to his foes, and in <date value ="1232">1232</date> he managed to
 persuade <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> that his justiciar was robbing him. In one
 of his senseless rages the foolish youth dismissed his faithful counsellor, calling on him to give full account of all he
 had spent since he took office, and charging him  with
 favouring law-breakers, giving selfish advice, and behaving
 treasonably. <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> asked for time to answer, and took
 refuge in Merton Chapel (<placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName>). Onlyhis old chaplain Luke,
 now Archbishop of Dublin, dared speak for him, the Londoners clamoured to the king to try him for murdering
 <persName key="Constantine">Constantine</persName>, and his other enemies brought unjust accusations against him. Fearing injustice, he begged a further
 delay; but the angry king bade the mayor ring the City bell
 and summon the citizens in arms to bring the earl before
 him dead or alive. Happily Randulf got this cruel order

 recalled, and <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> gave <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> more time; but repenting again, he sent Godfrey of Craycombe with 300 soldiers to bring him to the Tower. Godfrey dragged the earl out of church and sent for a smith to fetter him. When the man came and found whom they wished to iron, he cast down his tools with a heavy sigh, and said, <q type="spoken">"Do what ye will to me, and God have mercy on my soul; but as the Lord liveth I will never set irons on this man. Is not he that good and faithful <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> who hath so often saved England from being the spoil of aliens? Did he not serve King <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> in Gascony and Normandy, eating horse-flesh rather than give up his trust, so that his very foes honoured him ? Did he not hold <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> against the French prince and all his host, and beat his fleet at sea, and save us all ?  I need not speak of
<placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> and Bedford.  God judge between you and him!
Surely ye are dealing unrighteously and unkindly with him, requiting him evil for good."</q>  But Godfrey, knowing that the king had sworn to hang him if he came back without
<persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>, bound him with ropes and bore him off. The bishops would not suffer sanctuary to be broken, and made
<persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> send him back next day, but the royal officers blockaded the church till the earl was obliged to give himself up for lack of food. The king, however, grew ashamed of his violence, and let him live quietly at Devizes Castle under care of Richard, Earl of Cornwall (who had wed Isabel, the Marshal's sister, in <date value ="1230">1230</date> by <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>'s advice), the Earls of
Warrenne and Derby, and the Marshal Richard (who had lately succeeded his brother William).</p>
   <p>Bishop Peter now swayed <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> as he would; his friend,
 the cowardly and clever Stephen of Segrave, was made
 Justiciar, his son, Peter of Rivals, treasurer. He drove the
 English judges, sheriffs, and castellans from their offices as
 traitors, and filled their places with poor and greedy Bretons
 and Poitevins, who flocked over in crowds to taste the king's
 bounty; so that outlaws were set to uphold the law, malefactors to keep the peace, and robbers to maintain the realm.
 The English barons were not likely to suffer their rights to
 be swept away, and the charters broken by these aliens
 without resistance, and in <date value ="1233">1233</date> they told <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> plainly that
 unless he got rid of his foreign counsellors they must choose
 another king. Peter bribed some of them to join him, tried
 to lure their leader, Richard the Marshal (for the prudent and
 powerful Earl Randulf had died in <date value ="1232">1232</date>), to court to seize
 him, and sent to Devizes to slay <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>. But the Marshal
 was warned in time, and went off to his Welsh earldom,



<pb id="p.139" n="139"/>


 where he was joined by <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>, who had been rescued by his soldiers. The bishop then proclaimed Richard a traitor, and when he asked to be tried by his peers, answered that the king could punish an evil-doer without trial if he chose.  Richard and the barons now made a league with
<persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName> Prince of Wales and resolved to take up arms to defend themselves, for the bishop had sent for more hired soldiers from abroad. In August, when <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> marched into the Marshal's earldom, they surprised him at Grosmont,
November 11, and put him to disgraceful flight, and twice beat his captains at Monmouth, November 25 and December
26. Following up these victories, <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName> and Richard took and burned Shrewsbury in January, and laying waste the lands of Peter and Stephen of Segrave, drove the king from
Gloster to <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>. Still <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> remained stubborn, and would not listen to any one but Peter, till on April 9,
Edmund Rich, the newly chosen Archbishop of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>
(Stephen had died <date value ="1229">1229</date>, and his successor Richard in <date value ="1231">1231</date>), a pious and righteous man, came before him with a great number of clergy and said, <q type="spoken">" My lord, Peter's evil counsel lost your father his people's love and in the end his life. He egged on Fawkes to defy you, and led the Poitevins to rebel, and now he and his son are jeoparding your very crown.
Had you not listened to them your realm would not be divided against itself, your lands harried, or your money wasted.  You have put yourself into the hands of a gang of lawless perjured aliens, who reck nothing of you or your realm, and flourish on war and pillage. You have been warned before.  Repent now or we shall forthwith excommunicate you and all those who have estranged your loving subjects from you and broken the peace."</q>  <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>'s eyes were at last opened, he dismissed Peter to his diocese, drove his son and Stephen of Segrave from their posts with threats and reproaches, and sent Edmund to treat with
<persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName> and the Marshal.</p>
  <p>But it was too late to undo the ill that had been done.
Peter had written to some barons of Ireland bidding them seize Richard's lands there, and the Marshal hurried over sea to repel his foes. He carried all before him till Geoffrey of
Marsh, a false friend who had agreed to betray him, led him to meet the chief Irish barons near Kildlare, April I, to talk over a truce.  The meeting ended in a battle, on which
Geoffrey treacherously withdrew his troops, and left the
Marshal with fifteen knights to withstand an enemy ten times his number; for he refused to fly. <q type="spoken">" I never turned

 my back in battle yet, and God save me from such shame to-day."</q> He held his own for several hours, like a lion at bay, slaying eight men with his own hand; for he was one of the strongest and most skilful knights alive, and he was not overcome till they set their Irish kernes to hough his horse, when he fell and was stabbed in the back before he could gain his feet. After a few days in prison he died of his wounds to the grief of all England, <quote>" for he was of the fairest face and form, of the finest courtesy, the noblest blood, and the widest knowledge, peerless in all feats of knighthood, a man that had ever the fear of God before his eyes, and the good of his king and country at heart, and was not afraid to jeopard himself in their behalf to bring back peace and goodwill, standing like a living bulwark between his lord and the barons."</quote> <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> wept when he heard the news, but he let the murderers have the Marshal's lands, and though he made peace with <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName>, <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName>, and the rest of their party, he did not take the lesson to heart. He would not make a new justiciar or treasurer, but tried to do their work himself; and as he only worked by fits and was wont to lay aside his rightful business to take up great designs which were never carried out, people soon had cause to complain of neglect and delays of justice and waste of money. New favourites came too, who were no better than the old, and so fresh troubles arose.</p>

The streets of London were swept and cleaned, the houses were hung with garlands, banners, and lanterns; and a body of 360 burgesses, in silk gowns and hoods, mounted on fine horses with new trappings, rode out to welcome the bride. The wedding feast was splendid; the great earls acted as cupbearer, steward, almoner, and the like; the citizens of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> saw to the cooking, and the Londoners to the wines, and the good men of the Cinque Ports bore the canopy over the king and queen. Unhappily Eleanor soon made herself dis-liked. She was proud, did not care for the English or their ways, and encouraged her kinsfolk to come to England, where the king, ever fond of new faces and foreigners, married them to rich English heirs and heiresses, and loaded them with lands, gifts, and offices.</p>

  <p>In <date value ="1238">1238</date>, by <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> of Burgh's advice, <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> secretly married his sister Eleanor (the younger William Marshal's widow) to a newcomer, <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon of Montfort</persName>, and drew down the anger of Earl Richard of Cornwall and Gilbert the
Marshal his brother-in-law and a warning from the Pope not to estrange his loyal subjects for the sake of new friends.
But <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> was not really an alien. His grandfather had married Amisy, sister and heiress of the Earl of Leicester.
His father, the famous warrior Simon, had led the French crusade for the Pope against the Pure Christians of Albi and Beziers, who denied his authority, slaying the King of
Aragon, who came to their rescue at Moret, and breaking the power of their lord the Earl of Thoulouse, whose lands soon after fell into the hands of the French king. But <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, who did not wish to see the Pope or French king profit by his brother-in-law's ruin, would not let <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> hold the earldom of Leicester, and gave it into the care of Randulf Earl of Chester. When he died the great crusader's sons agreed to divide their dead father's lands, Almeric taking the French and <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> the English fiefs. <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> had therefore come to
England, and <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> not only gave him his father's earldom, but heartily favoured his marriage. However, his favour seldom lasted long, and in I239 he suddenly accused his brother-in-law of dishonourable behaviour, and <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> of giving traitorous counsel. <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> answered boldly, <q type="spoken">" My lord, I never was traitor to you or yours, or you would not be king to-day."</q> But <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>, disgusted, went abroad, and next year joined Earl Richard of Cornwall, with whom he had made friends on a crusade; for Richard, too, was tired of the king's fickleness and folly, and grieved to see England so ill-ruled. Richard ransomed many Christian prisoners, and rewalled Ascalon, and <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> showed such wisdom and prowess that the barons of Jerusalem asked him to take care of their realm till their young king was of age, but he had duties to do in England, and came home with his brother-in-law in <date value ="1242">1242</date>.</p>

 man, but more eager to get money for his master than to deal with these deep ills, and the good counsel he did give was spurned when men saw his grasping hands. On his tour through England he came in <date value ="1238">1238</date> to <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, where great schools had lately sprung up after the model of those of the far-famed Paris University. The scholars were most of them poor, and many of them lived by begging; but they sent Otho a gift of meat and wine, and went to see him at
Oseney Abbey, where he was lodging. But his brother, who was steward of his household, a pompous person, nicknamed by the scholars Nabuzaradan, rudely thrust them from the doors, and when a poor Irish priest begged for a little soup, threw a ladleful of the boiling broth in his face. A Welsh student that stood by drew his bow and shot the steward dead. A fray began; the gownsmen swarmed out of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> armed with bows and short swords, and Otho only saved his life by flying up Oseney steeple. For this fray <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>, to please Otho, fined the scholars heavily, and shut up their schools for a time. In <date value ="1240">1240</date> Otho, having done little good, went away, taking with him, men said, more church money than he left behind.  Grieved by the legate's taxes and the king's harsh enforcement of his grandfather's Constitutions, Edmund piteously besought the Pope and <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> to stay their hand before the English Church was utterly destroyed, but he spoke in vain. So worn out by care, and hopeless of relief, he crossed the sea like <persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName>, to seek peace at Pontigny, and breathed his last at Soissi. In <date value ="1246">1246</date> the Pope declared him a saint for his good life and true heart, and the miracles said to have been wrought at his tomb. His archbishopric was given to the queen's uncle, Boniface of
Savoy, a well-meaning but violent and self-willed young man.</p>
   <p>But better help was now at hand. Francis of Assisi, a young Italian nobleman, pitying the sick and poor, whom no man heeded, made up his mind to live, like the apostles, for their sakes and God's. He gave up his goodly heritage and all the common joys of life, and trusting to charity for his daily bread, clad in a single coarse undyed hooded woollen coat, girt with a cord, went about barefooted all day among the lepers and sick and poor, tending and teaching them. His kind heart and wonderful unselfishness drew followers to him, and he went to Pope Honorius to get leave to found an Order of Begging Brothers, or Mendicant
Friars, who should vow to give up all that they had, to obey the Pope and the heads of their Order in all things, and to labour all their lives for the poor sick and helpless. When


 <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>



Honorius looked at his sad wan face, his untrimmed hair and beard, his mud-stained feet and dirty threadbare coat, and heard these hard vows, he despised him as a madman, saying, <q type="spoken">"Get thee to the pigs, brother, fit fellows for thee roll with them, and preach to them the rules of thy Order."</q>
Francis bowed his head, and went to the first pig's wallow he could find and did as the Pope bade him; then, caked in filth from head to foot, he came back to the Pope. <q type="spoken">" My lord, I have done thy bidding, grant me my prayer."</q> Honorius, touched by his humility, bade him go and wash himself and come back quickly, for he would grant him his whole desire. Francis' Grey Brothers soon spread in little groups of tens and sevens over all Christian lands, and even went as missionaries among the heathen. When they came to a town, they built a little shed outside the wall, among the huts of the poor and lepers, to sleep in, and with no other dwelling went forth to their work of healing and teaching those who had no other helpers. Brother Agnell was their first head in England, and within ten years of their coming here they had forty convents.  The poor and the better clergy welcomed them gladly, and Adam of Marsh, the friend of Robert Grossetete Bishop of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> and of
<persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon of Montfort</persName>, was one of their first recruits.</p>
  <p>Dominick, a canon of Osma in Aragon, who saw that the heretic teachers of the Albi Pure Christians were winning their way against the Catholic Church by their fervent preaching and lives of self-denial, founded an Order of
Brothers Preachers, who were to take vows, poverty, and obedience, and devote themselves to the good of their neighbours' souls.  These Black Brothers soon came to
England under the encouragement of the king and Archbishop Edmund, and did good work. They were followed by other orders, such as the White Friars, or Brothers Carmelites, and the Austin Friars, or Hermit Brothers, till there were two or three hospitals or convents of these zealous champions of faith and charity in every town, in spite of the opposition of certain lazy monks and selfish parish priests who did not like to see others doing the work they had so long left undone.</p>

 and King Louis IX. was unwilling to fight his brother-in-law for a province which he held on doubtful title (for his father had sworn to give it back). However, the French barons would not hear of its surrender, and <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>'s heart was set on its rescue. With 1600 knights, 700 crossbowmen, and 20,000 foot he landed in Poitou, <date value ="1242">1242</date>, and pushed on to Taillebourg. But here he was outflanked by Louis, and his lines laid open by the sudden desertion of the Poitevins, Earl
Hugh declaring that the letters sent to England were forged by his wife without his knowledge, and refusing to fight. But for a day's truce, granted at Earl Richard's request in return for his ransoming so many French prisoners in Palestine,
Louis must have taken <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> and all his host. Twelve hours' delay gave time for a rapid retreat; but an English division was beaten at Saintes two days later, and <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> was driven into Gascony, where he passed the winter, lavishing the money that might have won back Poitou on worthless Gascon favourites.  In the spring he made peace, yielding Poitou to Louis, and promising him &#x00A3;1OOO a year.
Followed by a throng of greedy foreign courtiers, <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> came home, and at Westminster in <date value ="1244">1244</date> told his council that he was deep in debt, and must have a grant of money from clergy and laymen too. The barons were a little distrustful of the clergy since Stephen of Langton's death, accusing them of looking only to their own good, and so obeying the Pope's unrighteous demands and trying to force the Church Law upon the country. This had led to their famous protest at Merton, <date value ="1236">1236</date>, <quote>"We will not let the Church change the laws of England."</quote> But when Robert Grossetete rose and told them that the only way for them to withstand the wrongful claims of Pope or king was for the clergy and barons to act together, they agreed to name a joint Board of
Twelve to speak for them all.  The Twelve told the king that the charters were broken over and over again, and that they must choose a justiciar and chancellor to build up the falling realm; but on the king's own word that he would keep his oaths, they let him have a scutage, refusing him any more money till things were better.</p>

  A king should seek his people's good, and not his own sweet will,
  Nor think himself a slave because men hold him back from ill;
  For they that keep the king from sin serve him the best of all,
  Making him free that else would be to sin a wretched thrall.

  And chooses freely what he knows will ease his people's plight.
  'All things are lawful to the king,' yea, but we also find
  'All things are not convenient,' which the true king keeps in mind.

[knights, country gentlemen, and merchants], to complete the reform, Parliament gave remedies for the Thirty Grievances, promised that the nobles should treat their vassals as the king treated them, and agreed to the sheriffs being chosen by the shire-moots.</p>
  <p><persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> and the king then went over sea to make a final treaty with France, and at Paris, <date value ="1258">1258</date>, <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> gave up all claims to Normandy in exchange for the Limousin, Quercy, and Perigueux, and the pay for 500 knights for two years.</p>

<persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> and the Bachelery, in spite of the people's warning:-
    <quote>'End, O Earl of Gloster, what thou hast begun !
    Save thou end it fitly, we are all undone.
    Play the man, we pray thee, as thou hast promised,
    Cherish steadfastly the cause of which thou wast the head.
    He that takes the Lord's work up, and lays it down again,
    Shamed and cursed may he be, and all shall say Amen."</quote>
And the queen and John Mansel, by taunting the king with giving up his rights, led him more than once to strive to free himself from control. But <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> drove out the aliens he had recalled, and the king's brother (now back in England as King of the Romans) and Prince <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> stood firm to their oaths.</p>
  <p>At last the Londoners' insults to his mother, whom they pelted and hooted as a witch, and the deadly feud between

Roger Lord Mortimer and the Marchers, made the prince turn, and both sides made ready to fight it out. To save bloodshed it was settled to refer the whole dispute to King
Louis.  His award, the <hi rend="italics">Mise of Amiens</hi>, 23rd January
<date value ="1264">1264</date>, swept away the Purveyance, gave the king power to choose his own ministers (whether aliens or no), but confirmed the charters.  A few days later Pope Urban freed <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> from his oath, and declared the New Constitution null and void.  King Richard, Lord Clifford, and many of the northern barons, Lord Mortimer and the
Marchers, and most of the bishops and earls now deserted the reformers; but <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> said, <q type="spoken">"Though all should forsake us, I and my four sons will stand up to the death for the righteous cause I have sworn to uphold, to the honour of the Church and the good of the realm ;"</q> and bitterly added,
<q type="spoken">"I have been in many lands, heathen and Christian, but nowhere have I seen such bad faith and falsehood as in
England."</q>  Chief among the faithful few were Hugh le
Despenser the Justiciary, Gilbert the young Earl of Gloucester, and the midland barons; but the Cinque Ports and
London, the <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> scholars and the' Franciscan friars were
<persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>'s warmest partisans. As in <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s days, the barons' strength lay in the south and east, the king's in the west.</p>

Cinque Ports, cut off London, and relieved Rochester, which
<persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> was besetting. The king's army plundered freely, and made the towns pay heavy ransom; and the barons, on a rumour that the Jews were betraying them, killed all they could take and laid hands on their money. <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> started to meet the king, sending to offer King Richard
 &#x00A3; 3000 if he would settle a peace, and to assure <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> that he only wished to free him from his foes; but his words were despised, and he was defied as a traitor. In the dawning of the 14th May, having surprised the royal outposts,
<persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> marched over the downs on Lewes. When he saw the spire of the priory where the king lay he halted his men, and, all dismounting, spoke: <q type="spoken">"Brethren, we are going to fight to-day for our country and our oath's sake. Let us pray God, if this our undertaking be pleasing in His sight, to give us might to fulfil the same, serving Him as good knights, and overcoming all our enemies."</q>  The soldiers then fell upon the ground and prayed, stretching their arms out crosswise, <q type="spoken">"Lord, give us victory according to our desires and Thy glory !" </q>while the brave old Bishop of
Worcester blessed them. <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> now drew up his army, and having knighted the Earl of Gloucester and other young

The king's main body made for the standard-car, where they thought to find <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>, but their straggling ranks were cut in two by the steady advance of the barons. When
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> came back from the pursuit, he found <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> victorious. King Richard had been driven into a mill, where, to the mockery of his foes, he was taken by Sir John of
Bevs, a new-made knight, and King <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>, driven back wounded and on foot (for his charger had been killed under him) to the river, had yielded to the Earl of Gloucester.
Next day the king sealed the <hi rend="italics">Mise of Lewes</hi>, in which he vowed to keep the Charters and the Articles of Grievances, to live thriftily till his debts were paid, to employ no aliens, to refer the Purveyance to arbitration again, and to give his son
Edward and Henry, King Richard's son, as hostages for his good behaviour till a final reform was made. Great was the joy of Englishmen at this unhoped-for success (for the bulk of the barons' small army were raw levies), and deep their thankfulness to <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>, as the <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> friar's lay witnesses:-

Earl Gilbert, and the Bishop of Chichester) to name the king's Standing   or Privy Council anew, and lowered its number from Fifteen to Nine. They also did away with the
Parliamentary Commissioners, for <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> held it as much a man's duty to think and work for his country as to fight for her. The authority of the Electors, who were to watch the council, was only to last for a fixed time.</p>
   <p>The queen, Archbishop <persName key="Boniface">Boniface</persName>, and those who had fled

<persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> therefore formed a camp at <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, and the Cinque Port mariners, stopping the Pope's legate, tore up the Bull against the barons which he wished to bring to England, and blockaded the queen's fleet till she disbanded her soldiers. In <date value ="1265">1265</date> <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> called a Parliament, to which he summoned not only earls, barons, clergy, and two knights
(chosen by the shire-moot) from each shire, but also two burgesses from each city and town, which had never been done before; for he wished to have the approval of all classes for his plans, and this he got from his full Parliament.</p>
  <p>Not that his foes were all crushed. Earl Gilbert, like his father, grew jealous of another's leadership, and took offence at the somewhat proud behaviour of the younger Montforts.
Roger Mortimer and the Marchers rose, William of Valence landed in South Wales with a body of crossbowmen, and an able and zealous leader was found in Prince <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>, who escaped from his custody at Hereford. Getting leave to ride out in the country, he made his guards race their horses till they were tired out, when, leaping on a fresh and swift horse, sent him by Lord Mortimer, he galloped off to Wigmore, safe from pursuit.  Earl <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> with the king had gone west to cut off the rising on the March and get help from
<persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName>, sending his second son, <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>, to Kenilworth to gather troops there and join him at Evesham, whither he now turned. But by a sudden raid <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> surprised and broke up young <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>'s camp, taking his banner and driving him into the castle till help came. Knowing that Earl <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> had but few men with him, he then hurried off to Evesham to attack him, before young <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> could gather his scattered troops and march to his father's help.</p>

So furious was his charge that at first it seemed as if he would cut his way through them, though they had seven men to every two of his; but his Welsh footmen lost heart and fled, and Sir Warin of Basingburn rallied the prince's men with the cry, <quote>"Remember Lewes!"</quote> and the little troop of White Crosses was soon hemmed in.

Piers of Montfort, his cousin John of Beauchamp, Hugh le

<pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

 on to the last like a giant for the freedom of England, till a foot soldier stabbed him in the back under the mail, and he was borne down and slain. The unequal fight had lasted from six to nine o'clock in the midst of the darkness caused by a great storm, and was so fierce that King <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName>, who had been forced to ride with <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> to the battle, had much ado to save his life, being badly hurt by a javelin before he could make himself known to his son's soldiers. The conquerors savagely mangled the dead earl, and sent his head to Maud, wife of Roger of Mortimer, but the prince allowed the Grey Brothers of Evesham to bury his body.</p>
  <p>Those who knew <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> praise his piety, admire his learning, and extol his prowess as a knight and skill as a general.
They tell of his simple fare and plain russet dress, bear witness to his kindly speech and firm friendship to all good men, describe his angry scorn for liars and unjust men, and marvel at his zeal for truth and right, which was such that neither pleasure nor threats nor promises could turn him aside from keeping the oath he swore at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>; for he held up the good cause <quote>"like a pillar that cannot be moved, and like a second Josiah esteemed righteousness the very healing of his soul."</quote> As a statesman he wished to bind the king to rule according to law, and to make the king's ministers responsible to a full Parliament; and though he did not live to see the success of his policy, he had pointed out the way by which future statesmen might bring it about.</p>
  <p>13. As soon as <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> had left Kenilworth, young <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> gathered his scattered troops and followed him towards
Evesham; but having halted at Alcester for a meal, he was too late for the battle, and was obliged to go back in great grief to his castle, where many of his father's party who had not been at Evesham joined him. In October the king, wishing to put an end to the struggle, called a Parliament at Winchester, when all laws made since Lewes were annulled, and all who had fought against him disinherited. The city of
London was fined and lost its charter, and the Lady Eleanor,
<persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>'s widow, banished. <note place="foot" n="12">The Disinherited, <dateRange from="1265" to="1267">1265-1267</dateRange>.</note>
<hi rend="italics">The Disinherited</hi>, seeing that they could get no mercy, determined to fight it out.

 himself after a hand-to-hand fight.  But the garrison of
Kenilworth defied the whole royal army, for it was strongly built and held by stalwart men; and when the legate in his red cope excommunicated them, they dressed up their surgeon, Master Peter Porpoise, a cunning man, and set him on the wall to curse him back. In August, at a Parliament at
Coventry, Prince <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> got a Board of Twelve chosen to try and make a just award concerning the Disinherited.
Henry of Germany was the chief of those chosen, and they drew up the Ban of Kenilworth, October <date value ="1266">1266</date>, by which-</p>
 <p><quote rend="blockquote">The charters were again confirmed, and the Purveyance again cancelled.
  The adherents of <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> were to be punished by fine, not disinherison, so that the king could repay those who had served him faithfully without giving cause for fresh war.
 Those who should proclaim <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> a holy or righteous man (seeing that he died under the ban of the Church), or spread abroad vain and idle miracles said to be wrought by his dead body, were to be punished.</quote></p>
 <p> But the besieged refused this award as too harsh, and held out till Christmas, when for lack of victuals famine-fever broke out among them and they were obliged to yield. However, though his cause was now hopeless, Sir John d'Eyville set up a fortified camp at Ely, and issuing forth thence plundered <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> and <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName>, carrying off the Jews and rich citizens for the sake of their ransoms, so that the king was obliged to march against him. By means of a bridge of hurdles and planks thrown across the fen, Prince <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> carried the island, July <date value ="1267">1267</date>, after much trouble; but Sir
John got away and joined the Earl of Gloucester, who, fearing that his enemy Roger of Mortimer was plotting against his life, had raised an army, and having plundered
Westminster Palace and occupied London, was besieging the legate in the Tower.  The king hurried south, sent abroad for hired soldiers, and beleaguered the city for sixty days, till peace was made by the good offices of King
Richard and Sir Philip Basset. <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewellyn</persName> of Wales was still in arms, and <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> led an army against him; but the legate brought about a treaty between them at Shrewsbury, and soon after the work of peace was completed by a reissue of the remedies of the Thirty Grievances or Provisions of Westminster at a Parliament at Marlborough.</p>

 plague, and they were only able to succour his suffering army.
Henry of Germany and others now determined to go home with the returning Frenchmen; but Prince <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> swore that if all left him, he and his groom Fowin would go on to
Acre (which was being closely besieged by the Saracens) dead or alive, and so went his way with his faithful wife and his own men in thirteen ships only. Henry got as far as
Viterbo, when <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon of Montfort</persName> and his brother Guy, who was living there with an Italian earl, his father-in-law, set upon him in the cathedral as he was praying after the mass and stabbed him as he clung to the altar praying for mercy.
They then dragged him out of the holy place and mangled his body in revenge for the way the king's knights had treated their father's corpse. For this dreadful deed Guy was outlawed, but <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> died before he could be brought to justice. King Richard was ailing already, but when he heard of his son's murder he rapidly grew worse, and shortly afterwards died. He was buried at his church at Hales by the side of his wife Sancha. He was a man who had given great promise of a finer career, and had he been content with his position in England might by his good influence over his weaker brother have prevented much of the trouble that fell upon the country during his life.</p>
   <p>In Easter <date value ="1271">1271</date> <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> reached Acre and raised the
 siege. He then pushed on to Nazareth and took it, and
 gained a battle over the Memlook army at Kakehow. In
 August, while he was staying at Acre, the Emir of Joppa
 sent him many messages pretending that he wished to
 become a Christian; and at last, as he was sitting on
 his bed in the heat of the day, a messenger bearing letters
 from the Emir was brought to talk with him. As the prince
 was listening to him the man suddenly drew a poisoned
 dagger and struck at him. The prince caught the blow on
 his arm, and thrust the assassin backwards with a blow of
 his foot, then leaping up, he wrested the knife from him and
 killed him before his chamberlains could run up. The
 wound grew worse, and it was feared that it might prove
 deadly, when an Englishman came forward and promised
 to cure him if he would let him cut out the poisoned sore.
 The princess wept for fear of the operation, but her
 brother-in-law Edmund and John of Vescy led her away, saying,
 <q type="spoken">" It is better, lady, that you should weep than that all England should have cause to mourn ;"</q> and the surgeon treated
 the prince so skilfully that within a fortnight his arm was
 healed. However, having been called home by his father,

  <p><persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> was a good man, merciful, pious, brave, fond of learning and a lover of art and poetry, a kind father and a fond husband, and ever desirous of doing his duty to his people and his Church ; but he had faults which made him unfit for the crown.  He was extravagant, fickle, quick-tempered, suspicious, yet easily led, and full of false ideas of his duties and rights as king; but above all, he set so little store by his plighted word that no man could depend upon his promises, and it was this sin that led him into misfortunes and brought upon him the contempt and dislike of those who would but for it have loved and respected him.
Had not his finer qualities enabled him to gain the friendship of those wiser than himself and secure the love of his son and his brother, he would certainly have lost his king. dom, and most probably his life. In person he was like his father, of middle height, well made, and handsome (save that one of his eyelids drooped somewhat over the pupil of the eye), his manners were courteous and graceful, and he spoke well and readily.</p>

   <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1">Medieval Europe.</note>During the hundred years that followed the restoring of law and order by <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> great changes had come about in England.  English society, government, books, and speech, all alike showed deep marks of the new thoughts and feelings that, step by step, had spread over Western
Europe, and set up that form of civilization which we call medieval. A civilization which had Rome for its religious centre, and looked to Paris, <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, and Salerno for its learning, and the French and English courts for its literature. A knot of states whose commerce, regulated by self-governing guilds, flowed westward from the great Italian trading republics, through the fairs of France and Germany to the marts of Flanders and the ports of England and Gascony, till the circuit of trade ended



<pb id="p.159" n="159"/>


 in the counters of the mighty Hanse Company, the merchant principality of the Baltic. Europe was thus a set of kingdoms governed by curious half-feudal, half-free, half-despotic constitutions, in which local feelings were everywhere strong, but centralization everywhere welcome, under which slavery was still legal and a foreign churchman a recognised controlling power, but where the free yeoman and the tradesman of the chartered borough had their due place in the
Parliament by the side of the wealthy prelate, the noble earl, and the anointed king. In these states dwelt a succession of generations who invented no single tool, implement, or art, who with rarest exceptions were wholly ignorant of the sciences of the past, and disliked the very dreams of the sciences that were to come, but who could build cathedrals which are <soCalled>"miracles in stone,"</soCalled> forge metal-work which has never been surpassed, embroider raiment more splendid than that of the East, and show, amid squalor, dirt, and misery, a true and unfailing taste in every article of daily life. A state of society ignorant, cruel, and superstitious, whose pattern is to be found in marvellous and often unpleasant legends of anchorites and martyrs, and in the brilliant but misleading romances of chivalry, but withal a state of society in which men were earnest, dutiful, and hardworking, and which could display such noble types of character as the untiring and unselfish Francis, the friend of the poor and helpless, the brave and holy bishops Hugh and
Grossetete, the faithful Earl <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>, and the saintly King
Louis. Such was that medieval Europe of which England henceforward stood forth one of the foremost powers.
To bring England into this place many causes had wrought together: first the stern order of the Norman kings and bishops, and the far-sighted decrees of <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> and his ministers, who had not only strengthened the king but had kept up free local government; then the loss of the North
French provinces, which left English interests as the sole business for English kings; and, above all, the struggles in which churchmen, nobles, yeomen, and merchants had stood side by side for English freedom against foreign foes and royal misrule. And all these had made the nation more of a whole than it had ever been before. Then there were the
Crusades and the wide interests they had roused, the spread of trade, and hence rise of towns under the favour of the

Greece and Rome back to Christian Europe, and raised the palace and cathedral schools into noble universities where zeal for learning and orderly teaching paved the way for the
Reformation and Renaissance centuries later.  Last, but not least, there were the friars at their lowly but most useful work, raising the poor and helpless, reproving cruelty and slavery, breaking down class-pride, spreading new knowledge and better ways among the meanest of the land.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The English Constitution of the thirteenth century.</note>The form of government which was set in working order by <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> lasted long, as it was not only well fitted for the wants of his day, but could easily be suited by slight changes to the shifting needs of later times. <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName> revised it, and the statesmen of <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> made new use of it in the Good Parliament, but its main features remain even in our own times. The active power was in the hands of the king and his Council, and was carried out by ministers, officers, and judges chosen by the Crown.
What the courts and boards were which made up the central admzinistration may be best seen from Tables I., II., III. The great struggle of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in England was not the old one, whether the king was to rule at his will-for since the Charters all were agreed that <quote>"the Law was above the King"</quote>- but whether the Council, Ministers, and officers were to be appointed by the Crown or by Parliament. In the end the king kept the right of naming them, but that they owed an account to Parliament as well as to the Law for all they did was clearly acknowledged; and kings found it best for themselves to dismiss unpopular ministers. The office of Grand Justiciar, the holder of which had been Prime
Minister, President of the Council, and Chief Judge in one, was swept away after the barons' war in <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName>'s later days, as the king would not have a nominee of the barons put in such a place of power, and the barons would not take any man the king might choose. The duties of the office were therefore shared out among the Treasurer, Chancellor, and the chief judges of the three Common Law Courts (as will be seen in Table II.)</p>
   <p>The Great Council of the Realm, during the reign of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> by the separate summons of knights of the shire (see Great
Charter), and under <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName> by the summons of burgesses, grew from a gathering of nobles and crown-tenants into a regularly-called representative assembly fully entitled to speak for the whole nation. The old belief <quote>" that what touches all should be treated of by all"</quote> was held firmly by



<pb id="p.161" n="161"/>


 the English statesmen of the day, and it only remained to be seen how far the control of taxation should lie with the nation, and this was in the days of <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName> and <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> settled in favour of the Parliament.</p>
  <p>Local government in the shires was carried on by the shire-moots and hundred-moots under the eye of the sheriff and hundred-elders. These were controlled in matters of justice by the Royal Judges, who went regular circuits through each county to hold courts of assize. In matters of revenue the sheriff was helped by coroners and escheators (officers chosen in the shire-moot to look after the king's rights over felons' land and the like), and had to give his account and pay his dues to the Exchequer Court twice a year. In matters of police and militia the new decrees as to the fyrd
(see p. 33), the making of high constables of the counties, and the heavy fines of the king's judges had all bettered matters much. The sheriff was still the highest officer in the county, but he was chosen by the freeholders of the county (till <persName key="Edward II.">Edward II.</persName>'s reign), and so carefully looked after that his means of misusing his power were slight, and the chief complaints from the counties now refer rather to the harshness or bribery of the royal officers and judges, and show little illwill to the sheriff or his officers.</p>
  <p>An example of a criminal trial in <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName>'s time will
  show best how like and how unlike the law system followed
  was to that of our own time. A man supposed to have committed a murder is taken by the village watchman and
  handed over to the sheriff for safe keeping till the king's judges come round and the assize courts are held. At a shire-moot then held, the grandjury having heard the proofs against the prisoner present him as guilty. He is now taken into the assize court before the king's judge and a sworn petty [small] jury of twelve of his neighbours (named by four knights chosen in the shire-moot for this duty); but if he pleads not guilty [claims to be innocent] after the indictment
[accusation] is read to him, the jury, who are supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter, settle whether he is guiltless or not; if they give a verdict against him the judge gives sentence of death according to law, and this is shortly carried out; if, on the other hand, the jury hold him quit of the charge, he is set free. Witnesses were not often called on either side; the prisoner had to defend himself.
The goods and lands of convictfelons (persons found guilty of bad crimes) were forfeited to the Crown, hence prisoners, fearing lest their families should suffer, would sometimes




<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>

 refuse to plead before the king's judge, in which case they were starved and heavily chained till they agreed to do so, for till they pleaded the trial could not go on. In Civil
Cases there was no grand jury; the petty jury heard the plaintiff and defendant state their case in person or by counsel, witnesses were often called, and the verdict ended the matter.  The king's judge presided over the trial, and told the jury the law of the case and the points they had to settle.  Appeals lay to the King's Bench at
Westminster, and finally to the Lords in cases where suitors were still dissatisfied.  The Common Law, that is, the body of Customs which made up the Law of England, was now studied, as well as the Civil Law (the laws of the old Roman Empire as preserved in the Code, Digest, and
Institutes of the Emperor Justinian).  The Serjeants and
Barristers-at-Law who pleaded in the king's courts, and the Attorneys, who acted as law agents in civil cases, found plenty to do, and formed a wealthy and flourishing though somewhat unpopular class.  The chief law-books of the period, all in Latin, are the Book on the Laws of
England, by <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> of Glanville, <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>'s famous and worthy Justiciar (which is thought to be founded on a lost work of <persName key="Flambard, Ranulf">Ranulf</persName> Torch, the clever but unrighteous minister of the Red King); the Book of the Exchequer, by Roger of
Salisbury's great-nephew, the Treasurer, Richard Nigel's son, Bishop of London in <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>'s time; a treatise on the Laws and Customs of England, by Nicholas of Bracton, one of <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName>'s judges, which was put into French under the name of <quote>"Bretton,"</quote> and became the chief authority on the English laws and constitution for several generations.
The Song of Lewes, by an <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> friar, which is cited above
(p. 152), puts strongly and clearly the views of the constitutional party in the main crisis of <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName>'s reign.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">Church and Universities.</note>The Church was richer than ever, and its hold on the people stronger even than before; for though it suffered for a time under the greedy grip of the kings and the heavy hand of the Pope's legates and tax-gatherers, yet the nation did not forget the patriotic stand made by such men as the
Bishops of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, Worcester, and Chester, and Archbishops Stephen and Edmund, in the fight for the <quote>"liberties of this realm."</quote>  The friars too, who were eagerly welcomed, atoned by their unselfish zeal for the shortcomings of the monks and parish priests and raised feelings of piety and charity which men showed by founding hospitals, building churches, going pilgrimages



<pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

 and freeing slaves and captives. The order and laws of the
Church were kept up by the courts of the archbishops, bishops, and archdeacons, who not only busied themselves with breaches of Church law by the clergy, but settled all cases touching. wills and marriage as being matters of conscience; nay, the canonists, as the Church lawyers were called, even tried to wrest contract cases out of the domain of the royal courts into their own, but this was sternly checked by <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> and <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName></p>
  <p>The Universities, which for long were among the chiefest stays of the Church, had now sprung into being. The abbey schools of Oseney and the friars' lectures at S. Mary's becoming under the Pope's bull a studium generale known as the Corporation or University of the scholars of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, organized after the pattern of the famous University of
Paris. And we have a set of charters by <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName> and following kings dealing with the maintenance of good order and the supply of cheap bread and wine among the riotous and needy students. Many of these were so poor that they used to get their bread by begging under written leave given by the Chancellor (as the head of the University was called).
Kindly rich men often left money to found <soCalled>" chests "</soCalled> for the use of the poorer students. The keepers of these chests lent money on pledge without interest for a year, so that a scholar could by this means keep himself till he was able to earn money by his learning. The scholars used to live in lodgings kept by masters of the University called Inns or
Hotels; of these there were many, for as yet there were no colleges. Every scholar belonged to one of the two Nations or Societies into which the University was divided, according as each man came from the north or south of the Trent.
Irishmen and Welshmen, of whom   there were many at
<placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, belonged to the South Nation.  Every year the members of each Nation chose an agent, called their proctor, from among the masters of the University to look after their interests. There were four Faculties or branches of learning
-Theology, Law, Medicine, and the Arts. Scholars usually began with the Arts course, studying first the <quote>"threefold way,"</quote> Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric, and then the
<quote>"four-fold way,"</quote> Music, Arithmetic, Geometry, and Astronomy, which were called the Seven Liberal Arts. After four years' study, and passing an oral examination in these, the scholar became a Bachelor of Arts; and by working three more years, and giving proof of his knowledge, he was admitted by the
Chancellor as Master or Doctor of Arts, and could give


<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>

 lectures and take part in the government of the University as a full member. Some stopped here, but many now began to work at another faculty, becoming Bachelor and Doctor of Law, for instance, by so many years more of work. Books were very costly, so that most of the teaching was by lectures, the students writing down the teacher's words and learning the passages he dictated. The construing was done into French, which was then spoken by all gentlefolk in
West Europe; but the books to be studied were Latin, and in Latin the Examinations were held and all the business of the University carried on, for Latin was the tongue of the learned and the clergy nearly all over Christendom. Students and teachers from one University often passed some time at another, whither they were led to hear some great teacher or to get rare books to read.  There were always many
English students at Paris, and some of the most famous
Schoolmen or Philosophers of that University, such as Scotus,
Hales, Kilwardby, and Ockham, were born in Britain. The
Latin rhyme of the day runs-
             <quote rend="blockquote"><foreign lang="LA">Filii nobilium, dum sunt iuniores
               Mittuntur in Franciam fieri doctores."</foreign></quote><note place="foot" n="4">See Glossary</note>
The friars soon flocked to the Universities to study Medicine and Theology, and the most famous teachers and writers were either Franciscans like <persName key="Bacon, Roger">Roger Bacon</persName> the Englishman, the foremost man of science of the whole middle ages, <persName key="Bonaventura, Saint">Bonaventura</persName>
 the Italian, and Lully the Catalan, or Dominicans like <persName key="Aquinas, Thomas">S. Thomas</persName> of Achino and the German Albert the Great.
There were two great parties among the medieval philosophers, some, called Thomists, following <persName key="Aquinas, Thomas">S. Thomas</persName>, the other, called Scotists, holding with <persName key="Scotus, Dun">Scotus</persName>. The best Eng lish teachers were of the latter party, which was favoured by the Franciscans.</p>
  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="5">English writers and English books,<dateRange from="1130" to="1280">1130-1280</dateRange>.</note>Now that people were taking pleasure in reading and learning, there were of course many books written, and the
Court of England was as noted for its historians and poets as for its lawyers and statesmen. In the reign of <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> the Treasurer Richard (<dateRange from="1170" to="1192">1170-1192</dateRange>), one of the judges, Roger of Howden (<dateRange from="1192" to="1200">1192-1200</dateRange>), and the Dean of S.

Dissay), who had been one of the royal clerks, wrote Chronicles in Latin. The monks too, Robert, prior of S. Mich&#x00E6;l's
Mount (died <date value ="1186">1186</date>), William the Little of Newbury (died about <date value ="1200">1200</date>), and many more wrote in the Year-Books, which were now regularly kept in every great abbey, the history of their own days. A more




<pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

 entertaining historian than these is Gerald of Barry (born
<date value ="1148">1148</date>, died <date value ="1223">1223</date>), the Archdeacon of Brecon. He studied at
Paris, was chaplain to <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>, tutor to his son <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> (with whom he went to Ireland), and companion to Archbishop
Baldwin on his progress through Wales to preach the
Crusade. In the course of his busy life he wrote four note-worthy books based on his own travels and collections-
<hi rend="italics">The Description of Ireland</hi>, <date value ="1186">1186</date>; <hi rend="italics">The Conquest of Ireland</hi>,
<date value ="1188">1188</date>; and <hi rend="italics">The Description of and Journey through Wales</hi>,
<dateRange from="1189" to="1208">1189-1208</dateRange>. The former of these he read with applause to crowds of listeners at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, for his amusing style and shrewd wit were sure to please. Then we have the Lives of
Becket by his friends, Herbert of Bosham, the faithful Grim, and the secretary, John of Salisbury (a learned man who died
Bishop of Chartres), and many others in Latin, and by
Warner, a French monk, in French verse. All these wrote of things that they saw and heard, but there were also famous poets and romance-writers who made tales and poems for gentlefolk's amusement.  At the head of these comes <persName key="Monmouth, Geoffrey">Geoffrey, the Archdeacon of Monmouth</persName>, who finding that there was a great gap in the history of Britain, and that nothing was known about the old Welsh kings, set to work to fill this blank by dressing up all the tales of Welsh gods and heroes he could get, and so made out a long line of imaginary kings stretching from Brutus, the son of &#x00C6;neas the Trojan, to <persName key="Caedwalla">C&#x00E6;dwalla</persName>, the ally of <persName key="Penda">Penda</persName>. Among these kings are Cymbeline the hero and Lear the Sea-god (whose tales as told by <persName key="Monmouth, Geoffrey">Geoffrey</persName> have been made into noble plays by
Shakespeare), and above all Arthur. Of this prince's legend
(which is like that of Finn the Irish hero) <persName key="Monmouth, Geoffrey">Geoffrey</persName> got hints in an old book of Welsh traditions, but he has magnified him into a great king, fighting the heathen, setting up a brotherhood of knights, invading <placeName key="Gaul">Gaul</placeName> and Italy, conquering the
Emperor of Rome, and finally perishing by the treason of his own kinsman. <persName key="Monmouth, Geoffrey">Geoffrey</persName>'s romantic book, which he called
The History of the Britons, was wonderfully well received. It soon spread in copies and translations into every land and tongue of Western Europe. Historians were delighted to have so much interesting information about an age hitherto dark (for nearly every one save William of Newbury took all <persName key="Monmouth, Geoffrey">Geoffrey</persName> wrote as pure truth): Englishmen were proud to have a king like Arthur to set against the French poets' hero, <persName key="Charlemagne">Charles the Great</persName>; and all readers were charmed by the beauty of the stories, which is so great that English poets to this day choose their subjects from among them.


<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>


<persName key="Monmouth, Geoffrey">Geoffrey</persName>'s history was supplemented by other French and English court-writers, who took other Welsh stories as he had done, and dressed them up very beautifully into tales of chivalry or knighthood.  Chief of these were the satirical poet
Walter Map, a West-country clergyman of rank, who wrote the beautiful stories of Lancelot and the Quest of the Holy
Cup; Robert of Borron, who told the tale of Merlin; Luces of Wast, who wrote Tristram; and Christian of Troyes, who amongst other stories has given that of Enid. All these were courtiers writing for the Court; but ere long Englishmen began to write in English tales founded on their own old traditions about Wade and King Horn and Havelock the Dane (Anlaf Ethelstan's foe), and later on to translate poems and prose-romances from the French.</p>
  <p><persName key="Monmouth, Geoffrey">Geoffrey</persName> dedicated his book to Robert of Gloucester. It was first put into French by Geoffrey Gaimar, who made a rhyming history of England for Queen Eleanor out of it and the <hi rend="italics">Old English Chronicle</hi>; Wace of Jersey, a canon, used it for his verse-history, the Brut (called after "Brutus the
Trojan"), and from this book of Wace's Layamon or Lawman, Leofnoth's son, the priest of Earnley on Severn, put it into English verse, c. <date value ="1205">1205</date>, in a long and stirring poem, written partly in the Old English alliterative metre, partly in the new French rhyming metre. This is the first long
English poem that had been made since <persName key="AEthelred">&#x00C6;thelred</persName>'s day, and it marks the beginning of a new era in English literature which lasted down to the Reformation, in which
Englishmen took the French poets and Latin prose-writers for their models, and in which English books were part of the great medieval literature which was common to all
Christian countries.</p>
  <p>From this time forward though many Englishmen still write in Latin for the learned and in French for the gentry, yet side by side with every French or Latin book there is an English one written, and little by little the bulk of books come to be penned in English. Thus side by side with
Latin and French sermons and books of prayer we find sermons and even the Gospels in English by the end of
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>'s reign, and about <date value ="1215">1215</date> the famous Gospel lessons of <hi rend="italics">Orm</hi>, an Austin canon (which we have in his own hand and spelling), written in a regular blank verse without rhyme or alliteration. To <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName>'s reign belong the <hi rend="italics">Nuns' Rule</hi> of
Bishop Poer, the <hi rend="italics">Castel of Love</hi> of Grossetete (both in French and English), the earliest English play, <hi rend="italics">The Harrowing of
Hell</hi>, and the Wise Sayings ascribed to the old English


<pb id="p.167" n="167"/>
 worthies King <persName key="AElfred">Alfred</persName> and Hending the Wise. Thus, too, turning to History, the same reign sees the last and best of the Latin chroniclers of the monasteries, the stern
Richard of Devizes, the delightful Jocelin of Brakeland, the enthusiastic Monk of Melrose, and the three writers of St.
Albans, which was then looked on as the storehouse and treasury of English history, the careful Roger of Wendover, the patriotic and outspoken Matthew of Paris, painter, traveller, and historian, and the sympathetic William  of
Rishanger, who gives the sorrowful tale of <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName>'s fall.
And by the side of these learned writers we find another monk, Robert of Gloucester, who writes the Saints' Lives and an English history in verse for simple Englishmen, and tells how with his own eyes he saw the darkness that shrouded <quote>"the murder of Evesham."</quote></p>
   <p>Now, too, the English poets of the South and Midlands have
 learned the French song-metres, and pour forth songs and
 lays and carols and hymns on all kinds of subjects. At
 first they also composed in French and Latin, or even mixed
 all the three tongues in one song; but they soon found that
 English is as musical and as powerful as any foreign language, and kept more and more to it alone.</p>
   <p>5. <note place="foot" n="6">Changes in the English tongue in the thirteenth century.</note>When
 people began to write in English again at the
 beginning of the thirteenth century, the English tongue had
 undergone great changes, and these changes had not taken
 place evenly throughout the land, so that there were, as
 Gerald of Barry noticed, three distinct dialects or forms of
 English, so different that a man from <placeName key="Carlisle">Carlisle</placeName> would not
 understand a man from Guildford, and a man from Peterborough could hardly make himself understood by either.
 The Southern dialect was the most like the Old English in
 sound and in words; it had changed least. The Northern
 dialect had changed most; not only had the words been
 greatly shortened and clipped, and most of the verb and
 noun endings either gone altogether or fading away quickly,
 but the Northern words of the Danish and Norwegian
 settlers had already driven out and replaced
 a great number of common English words, so
 that most of the household words north of the
 Humber differed from those of the South and
 Midlands. The Midland dialect is the most notable for us,
 for from it springs the English we speak and write to-day.
 It had cut down its words almost as much as the Northern
 dialect; it had whittled its cases down to <hi rend="italics">e, en</hi>, but it had,
 like the Southern dialect, kept most of the old stock of



<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>


English words. Books were written and songs made in all these dialects for many years more; but little by little, as we shall see, the Midland prevailed, and became the accepted form of English in England as the Northern dialect became in Scotland, while the Southern dialect sank to an uncultivated peasant-speech.</p>
  <p>The changes in English had hitherto been mostly in form, for even the words the Northmen brought with them were words such as the forefathers of the English had known and spoken. But in the thirteenth century crowds of wholly foreign words were brought into use, so that by <date value ="1300">1300</date> about one-tenth of the words in common use in books were of
French or Latin birth. How this came about it is easy to see: the friar, often a foreigner or brought up abroad, in his sermons would use the French or Latin words, which the people would soon get hold of; the doctor, the lawyer, the teacher, were obliged to use foreign words for medical, legal, and philosophical terms that had never been heard of in
England, and their patients, clients, and pupils copied them; the merchant described his foreign wares in high-sounding foreign words; the lady who talked French at Court, and took her fashions from Paris or Bourdeaux, used French or
Gascon words for the new dresses and the new dishes which came from abroad; the knight who had been a page at the royal court or the bishop's palace, and served oversea in his youth, had none but French terms for his business, war, and for his amusements, the joust and the chase. Even the builder and the engineer who came from  Normandy or
Flanders would bring in many words, which would spread among their workmen. Thus from all sides new words came pouring in during the whole thirteenth century, till the tide turned, and men began to look upon English as a rich and noble speech that could do very well without borrowing any more.</p>

<p>It is well worth while to pay good heed to the books and the tongue of England in the thirteenth century, for in them we have the springs of all that has been said or sung by our best poets and writers ever since, and the thirteenth century is as much the fountain-head of modern English speech and books and style as it is of the English Constitution of to-day. Orm and Bishop Poer and the nameless song-writers and preaching friars were doing the same work in their way as Earl <persName key="Montfort, Simon de">Simon</persName> and Bishop Grossetete did in theirs.</p>
  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="7">Towns and craft-guilds.</note>England had become richer during the long peace in spite of the civil war, and the towns had grown larger and more prosperous. London was now far the biggest city in
England, its wealth and the number of its citizens are dwelt on by many writers. Its mayor, for Richard had given the burgesses the right of choosing their own chief officer, was an officer of power and dignity, who served with earls and barons as a warden of the Charter which the city banner-bearer,
Fitz-Walter, had done so much to win. The levy which followed the red standard of S. Paul from the twenty-four city wards was a little host in itself. But besides its own citizens, London had a large foreign population.
There were Norman shippers; Gascon wine merchants;
Flemish wool-buyers; Lombard goldsmiths, money-lenders, and middlemen; Danish and     Norwegian sailors, who brought fur and fish and fir timber in exchange for cloth and wine, and enjoyed all rights of trade the same as Englishmen by old custom from   Cnut's days; Easterlings, whose warehouse or <soCalled>"counter"</soCalled> was the centre of the large
Baltic trade; and Jews, who had their own laws and customs and rulers in the Jewry under the king's particular order. As in Eastern towns to-day, those of a trade lived together, and each little lane had its own craft, to which the names of the City streets still bear witness. In
Cornhill were the clothiers, in Coleman Street the tailors, in
Candlewick Street the drapers; scribes and lawyers dwelt in Chancery Lane, goldsmiths in Westcheap, in the Vintry the wine merchants, the pepperers or grocers in Soper's
Lane [Queen Street]: by S. Mary's Axe lived the skinners; near Newgate the butchers, in Lothbury the braziers, the smiths and tanners at Holborn, and by the Fleet the sea-coal dealers and lime-burners had their wharfs. The great


<pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

 market was Cheapside, which had been the centre of the old British Londinium and the forum of the Roman Augusta.
At Smithfield cattle were stalled and sold; at the river-side were the fishmongers' stalls; the cookshops lined Eastcheap; taverns and alehouses abounded.</p>
  <p>Town life of the thirteenth century centred round the merchant-guilds and craft-guilds; the latter were now forming in nearly every trade. They bought the right of making their own bylaws for the good ordering of the trade and the benefit of its members. A boy taking to a particular craft was first bound apprentice to learn his trade with a mastercraftsman. When he had served his time he became a free journeyman (from the French, journee, a day's work), who could work for any master who chose to employ him at regular wages by the day. As soon as he had earned enough money to set up for himself, he paid his fee, showed his masterpiece, a test bit of work which proved his fitness, and was enrolled as master-craftsman. There was a guild-feast at least once a year, to which all the guild brethren came dressed in the livery of the company; and the brethren besides looking to the good of their trade, took care to provide a handsome burial and due services for companions who died, and succour for those who were in bodily distress or poverty. Women were companions of the guild just like men.  In London and other big cities the burgesses and merchants oftentimes showed jealousy of the craft-guilds, but the latter managed to hold their own in the end. From
<dateRange from="1262" to="1265">1262-1265</dateRange> the commonalty of the city forced the aldermen and richer folk to take Thomas Thomasson as mayor, and again in <date value ="1272">1272</date> they would have Walter Hervey against the will of the aldermen.</p>
  <p>Other towns, though they could not equal London, were yet growing in size and wealth also.  <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, beside its great yearly fair, had a large wine trade; Worcester was famous for its wheat, Hereford for its cattle; <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> had no small fish trade; <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> exports copper and tin; at Stourbridge Common by Cambridge was held the biggest fair in
England; Boston too had its fair, which was the scene of a raid by a gang of gentlemen robbers in <date value ="1288">1288</date>, wherein the town was fired, and more damage done, it was said, than all the wealth of England could repay; Yarmouth was the greatest seaport in the east as <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName> was in the west; merry <placeName key="Carlisle">Carlisle</placeName> and lordly Durham were capitals of large districts; <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> were the biggest northern towns, and <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName> was the Manchester of medieval England.</p>

<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>



  <p>We hear more than once of terrible riots in the towns, where the burgesses, upon some breach of the charters they had bought from king or bishop, rose in arms for redress.
Thus the good folk of Bury carried on a fifty years' feud with the monks of St. Edmund's Minster, in which they appealed both to arms and to law; and in <date value ="1272">1272</date> the 30,000 burgesses of <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName> burned the cathedral and sacked the priory, killing the monks' servants, for which the king fined the town 3000 marks and had many of the burgesses drawn and hanged.   But he did not dare to take away their rights or charter, or to justify the monks for the evil deeds which had angered the townsmen. King <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> was very favourable to the east-coast towns and the Cinque
Ports; but his son was no lover of the towns, and had a marked dislike to the Londoners, which they did not fail to return.</p>
  <p>7. <note place="foot" n="8">New fashions in building, arms, and dress.</note>All towns changed much outwardly in the thirteenth century.  Henry Ethelwin's son, the first mayor, put forth an order in London after a great fire, that in future all houses must be tiled, that party-walls must be at least sixteen feet high and two feet thick, and that chimneys must be properly built of brick or stone for the greater safety of the city.  This by degrees led to the replacement of the old straw-thatched daub-and-wattle cots by little stoutly-built one-storied houses. The building of new churches, chapels, friaries went on fast, and many wealthy aldermen or privileged aliens began to raise large stone houses.  The new Pointed style of architecture was brought in from
France, which ousted the old Roman or Round-arch style that had prevailed for so long, for it was stronger, lighter, and allowed of greater variety.  The marks of the new style are the pointed arch, the scientific vaulting with three sets of ribs, the long, narrow, lancet-headed windows grouped together, the pillars made up of fine clustered shafts, with beautiful deeply-carven capitals, the lofty roofs raised on arch-buttressed walls, and the tall graceful stone spires.  Among the best examples of the <hi rend="italics">Early Pointed style</hi> is the Cathedral at
Salisbury, raised by Bishop Poer, of which Robert of
Gloucester sings :-
                             <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>" In the year of grace</l>
<l>     Twelve hundred and twenty-two, I count, in the fair place</l>

     <l>Than which men know in Christendom fairer work none.</l>

   <l>The fourth for the Countess; the fifth he set, 'tis said,</l>
   <l>For the Bishop of Salisbury, and then no more he laid."</l></quote>
There is also the choir of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> Minster, the work of
S. Hugh's master builder, Geoffrey of Noyers, Bishop
Eustace's porch at Ely, and Walter of Merton's chapel at
<placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>.  <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName> himself was a lover of fine buildings. Under his eyes the King's Hall at <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> was finished, the Tower embankment made, Windsor Castle walled, and the Abbey of Westminster rebuilt splendidly round a magnificent tomb which his Italian workmen put up for the Confessor.  We hear too how <persName key="Henry III.">Henry</persName> envied his friend Louis the beautiful little chapel of the Holy
Crown which the latter had reared in Paris. Of castle-building there was far less than under the Norman kings, but the castles which were built were larger and finer than any yet seen, especially those upon the Welsh marches.
A few Border strongholds were fortified, such as Berwick, strengthened by <persName key="Alexander II.">Alexander</persName> II.; Wark, raised by William
Laymond; a few strong positions secured, such as Kenilworth, Montfort's refuge, and Rochester, the royal fortress; but none could rival the castle on the rock of Andelys, which
Richard I. himself designed and built.  Indeed the need for private castles was but little felt in England, where they were always objects of dread and hatred to the yeoman and the burgess, and of suspicion to the king. The engineers of this time, with the experience they gained in the
Crusades, were well skilled in breaching and undermining castles, though the use of cannon was hardly yet known north of the Alps.</p>
  <p>In the old-fashioned war-gear which had been so long unchanged changes were now made which led the way to the gradual disuse of mail in favour of plate armour. To the simple mail-coat were added hose, gloves, and a hood of mail; the helmet was made heavier and closed, save for slits for eyesight and breathing; a breastplate was beginning to be worn in jousts; the shield was lessened to a small triangle; and pieces of hardened leather or of brass or steel-plate were worn on the shoulders and over the knees and elbows, where the mail was weakest. Horsemen bore heavy cutlasses, maces of steel and iron, hammers and picks, and their lances were longer and heavier than before, and used underhand. Englishmen began to take to the longbow, a weapon the power of which was not known before, and



<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>

 our yeoman archers were soon to be acknowledged the best infantry that West Europe had yet sent forth.</p>
  <p>The science of Heraldry, a regular system of marks by the bearing of which a knight might be known and his family clearly shown, was now worked out, in imitation most likely ot the emblems of family and office borne by the Saracens.
Shield, pennon, and horse-trappings were painted with the owner's mark or cognizance, while he himself bore his coat of arms, a knee-long, sleeveless frock of linen painted or silk-broidered with the same emblems. Thus the English kings took for their arms three golden leopards on a red shield; the French kings bore silver lily-flowers sprinkled over a blue shield; the Scottish king a rearing red lion within an open red border ornamented with lily-flowers on a gilded shield, just as they still stand in one quarter of the royal arms; the
Hastings family bore a lady's sleeve of red upon a gilded shield; the Marshals a red lion on a ground half gold, half green; the Clares three red gables on a gold shield; the
Montforts a white double-tailed lion rearing on a red shield.</p>
  <p>The fashion of noble men and women's clothes was also changed during the thirteenth century by fresh forms of dresses and new kinds of silk stuff, such as velvet, samite, sendal, baldekin, and of costly furs brought from the East.
The shape and make of kirtle or gown, hose and shoes, was still the same; the upper garments varied much. A married lady's dress was shaped like that of a nun's now, with wimple, veil, overgown, and long round mantle; but the wimple was of lawn, the veil of silk, the mantle and gown of precious stuff and bright colours.  In winter overgown or surcoat and mantle were furred throughout.  Gentlemen wore gowns or surcoats falling below the knee, with embroidered hems. Richard had one of pink silk covered with silver moons and stars.  <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName> had one of purple samite with the three leopards worked in gold on the back and front.  Sometimes they wore shorter frocks called
<hi rend="italics">blouses</hi>, embroidered at the neck and deeply jagged at the edges of the skirt and sleeves. Both ladies and gentlemen wore hose of fine dyed cloth, and shoes of stained leather, often beautifully embroidered in fretwork. Travellers carried low round hats in bad weather, and clergymen would often have a light linen cap or coif over their tonsured heads; but as a rule all men and unwedded ladies went bareheaded, with a chaplet of flowers on holidays and merry-makings, and at other times a cord or ribbon to keep the hair off the



<pb id="p.175" n="175"/>


 face. A new fashion was coming up among women of binding their hair upon the sides of the head in a net of gold or silver wire bound round with ribbons. Gold and silver and bronze brooches were worn and shoes were buckled or laced, for buttons were not yet used.</p>
  <p>8. <note place="foot" n="9">Food, cost of land and living, population.</note> It is difficult to get at the average cost of living in the thirteenth as compared with former centuries, for tillage was still so rude that a fourfold return was reckoned a good yield, and crops often failed altogether, so that prices varied greatly.
Thus the average price of wheat was 4s. 6d. per quarter, but there are years when it sunk as low as is. and others when it rose to 80s. Still on the whole prices seem to have risen since the time of Domesday. A skilled outdoor labourer was paid about 2d. a day, an ordinary workman 1d.; the price of a bullock was about
8s. 6d., of a pig 6d. An acre of good plough-land was worth
6d., meadow-land 3s. or 4s., and wood is. per acre. The labourer at harvest-time was allowed daily two herrings, a quartern barley-loaf, ale to drink, and milk for cheese; his ordinary food was porridge of oatmeal, rye or barley bread, skim-milk, and soft cheese, and rarely he had a meal of stock-fish or of bacon, or perhaps a morsel of salt mutton, or a dish of fresh fish from the river. Game or fresh meat he never tasted. In the towns, though barley-bread and oatmeal porridge were the staple food, the burgess would have meat and kail, and pastry and puddings, and drink ale to his meals instead of water or milk. The population seems to have reached the number of 3,000,000.</p>

Italy, he came over Mont Cenis on his way into France.
As he was travelling by Chalons, the earl of that place challenged him and his men to a tournament. Nothing loath, the prince agreed, and on the day set the struggle began between the English and Burgundian knights. The earl charged through the English array till he reached
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>, when, dropping his sword, he clasped the prince round the neck with his right arm, and tried to pull him from his seat. But <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> sat still without moving till he felt that the earl had got firm hold, and then he clapped spurs to his horse, and dragging the unlucky Burgundian out of his saddle, shook him off by main force, so that he fell head-long to the ground. The Burgundians grew angry when they saw their lord's overthrow, and the game turned to earnest. Ere long the English knights were hard pressed, and many men were wounded and slain. And now the English archers, who stood outside the lists looking on, drew their bows and shot down the foreign knights' horses.

Edmund (called the King of Sicily), and his mother, Eleanor, were all at the feast. There were great halls of timber built for the guests, who were many more than could be seated in Westminster Hall, the fountains at Cheapside ran all day with red and white wine instead of water, and two hundred fine horses were turned loose among the crowd to be scrambled for.</p>

While he was away, the regents, Walter, Archbishop of

Francis Accursi the counsellor, son of the famous Italian lawyer, <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> now set about devising new laws for the common good of the whole realm, awaking old Acts which had fallen asleep during the troubles of the realm, putting right those things which had gone wrong through misuse, and making clear those rules and customs which had grown dark and hard to understand.

 threat. In <date value ="1276">1276</date> the Rageman Statute appointed judges to settle all suits touching encroachments made on the land or rights of private persons since <date value ="1261">1261</date>. In <date value ="1278">1278</date> the Statute of
Gloucester regulated the private courts of justice and the lords' rights in the hundred and manor courts, and an order was given to the judges to inquire, under a writ called Quo
Warranto, by what right the lords held the private jurisdictions which they claimed. For the king wished to bring the whole land as far as possible under his own courts and judges. But the great lords did not like to lose their power over their tenants, and when the Earl of Warenne was called before the judges to prove the rights he claimed, he pulled out an old rusty sword, saying, <q type="spoken">" See, my lords, this is my warrant. My ancestors came over with William and won their lands with the sword, and with the sword I will keep the same against any one that wishes to seize them. For the king did not overcome and win this country by himself, but our forefathers were with him as partners and helpers."</q> And many of the other nobles said that the earl had spoken well, so that the king when he came to hear of it, fearing their displeasure, let this matter drop. But in the same year all gentlemen who had land to the value of &#x00A3;20 a year were ordered to receive knighthood or pay a heavy fine. The nobles did not like this measure either, for it brought their tenants into contact with the king, and showed them that
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> meant to rule for the good of all rather than for the benefit of a few great folks. One day as the king went out of Parliament to hear evening service there were some of the nobles' sons waiting on him as pages, and he began talking to them. <q type="spoken">" What do you boys talk about when you are waiting outside the hall where I am in counsel with your fathers ?

 so he quashed the election, and set John of Peckham, a
Grey Friar, a pupil of Adam Marsh, a Doctor of Theology of
Paris, and a Reader of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, in Robert's room. Brother
John was kindly, generous, hard-working, zealous for his order and for his see, a lover of peace, a good scholar, and a famous hymn-writer. He tried to strengthen the power of the Church courts by certain Articles passed at a Church
Council at Reading, <date value ="1279">1279</date>. But <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> made him give up these Articles, and passed the <hi rend="italics">Statute of Mortmain</hi>, which forbade persons granting or receiving lands so that they came into <hi rend="italics">mortmain</hi> [the dead hand], i.e. became the property of corporations as endowments. This Act was especially aimed against the clergy, who were now the owners of more than a quarter of the land of England. For not only did pious people willingly give their estates to monasteries or churches, but many who wished to escape from feudal obligations would surrender their lands to a religious body, bargaining to get it back to be held of the new owners on easier terms. However, the archbishop held another Church
Council at Lambeth, <date value ="1281">1281</date>, and there declared that all cases touching Church patronage, or property held by Churchmen, belonged solely to the Church courts. But the king, justly angry at this encroachment on the rights of his royal courts, compelled him to drop these claims also.</p>
  <p>In <date value ="1283">1283</date> the <hi rend="italics">Statute of Merchants</hi>, giving traders easier means of getting their debts, was put forth, and in <date value ="1284">1284</date> the
Statute of Rhuddlan, which settled what kind of cases were to be tried in the Exchequer Court. In <date value ="1285">1285</date> the two important Statutes of Westminster the Second and of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> were passed. The first made great alterations in the land law, enabling estates to be settled in a family from parent to child for ever, by the clause <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="LA">De Donis Conditionalibus</foreign></hi> [of
Gifts on Condition] amending the law of dower, of Church patronage, of mortmain, and making great improvements in the assize and manor courts. The second was meant to put down the lawless bands of clubmen, old soldiers, outlaws, and sturdy beggars who had taken to robbing in gangs, and living upon the country. It makes the Hundred responsible for robberies committed within it, deals with the keeping of watchmen in towns and villages, the pursuit of thieves, the safety of the highroads, provides for the proper arming and calling out of the militia, and forbids markets to be held in churchyards. In the same year <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> by his decree and the writ of <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="LA">Circumspecte agatis</foreign></hi> settled the proper province of the Church courts, confining them, as of old, to cases touching



<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>
     <note type="header"  place="head"><date value="1289">[1289.</date></note>
 wills of goods, marriages, perjury, libel, tithes, Church matters, and wrongs done to clergymen. In <date value ="1289">1289</date>, in consequence of complaints against the judges for bribery, they were tried before a commission under Burnel, and all save two found guilty, turned from the bench, fined, and banished.
Next year the Statute of Westminster the Third was passed, by a clause of which (<foreign lang="LA"><hi rend="italics">Quia Emptores</hi></foreign>) every freeman is allowed to sell his land, or part of it, as he likes, but the man to whom he sells it is to hold of the seller's lord and not of the seller. This Act stopped the making of new manors, and tended to bring most landholders bit by bit into direct tenancy from the Crown.</p>
  <p>But with this wise measure was passed a cruel and unrighteous one, namely, the expulsion of the Jews from
England.  They were given three months to leave the realm, they were allowed to take all their movables with them, and had free passes to France at the king's expense.
More than 16,000 left the country. A number of the rich
London Jews were treacherously drowned on the shoals at the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> mouth by the captain of the ship that was to take them over sea. But his wickedness was found out, and he was tried and hanged. The people were glad that the
Jews had gone, for they did not see that it was unwise to drive away clever and wealthy merchants who added to the riches of the country, and only remembered the high prices they had paid to them, and the strict law of debt which the
Jews had used against them. It was more than 350 years ere the Jews were allowed to set foot in England again.
With this Act the first period of <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>'s reign closes, and he was now called away to do other work no less important, however, his greatest and most needful reforms had been successfully carried out, and were working well.

 briefly told. Since the death of Cadwalla in <date value ="688">688</date> the Welsh had never been able to cope with the English, and the sovereignty which that king had for a time wielded' over the whole Welsh race was broken up. <note place="foot" n="2">The Welsh kingdoms- Cumberland, Cornwall, and Wales-<dateRange from="688" to="1272">688-1272</dateRange>.</note>
The Northumbrian kings soon pushed the Northern Welsh of Cumberland and Strathclyde so hard that the princes and noblemen sought refuge in Wales, leaving their land to sink into a dependency of the
North English or Scottish kings. Its after history has been noticed. After suffering from the inroads and settlement of the Northmen, it was given as a fief by Edmund to Malcolm
I., was the cause of war between Ethelred and his vassal
Malcolm II., was for a while almost independent under
Thorfin and other earls of Northern blood, was seized by
<persName key="William II.">William the Red</persName>, and finally cut in two by <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>, the southern part, south of Solway, becoming English, while the northern, Strathclyde, Galloway, and the Dales, became part of the Lowlands of the new Scottish kingdom which
David had organized after the plans of Henry of England.</p>
  <p>The kingdom of the Corn-Welsh had been lessened step by step by the bands of armed West Saxon colonists who settled
Wilts, Dorset, Somerset, one after another, till <persName key="Ine the Wise">Ine</persName> (circa 700), who himself (probably through intermarriages of the West
Saxon and South Welsh royal families) had Welsh blood in his veins, fixed the Tone as the frontier between the two races. The great West Saxon kings finally subdued the little Celtic kingdom, <persName key="AEthelstan">Athelstan</persName>'s expedition to the Scilly
Isles (<date value="939">939</date>) being almost the last notice of the series of victories by which it was achieved.  On the whole, the people seem to have been content with their new rulers.
For though there was hard fighting in <persName key="Ecgberht">Ecgberht</persName>'s days, when the Corn-Welsh called in the Danes to help them against the English kings, yet it was from the men of
Devon that <persName key="AElfred">Alfred</persName> got succour in his sorest need, while the
Welsh favourites and the Welsh alliances of <persName key="AElfred">Alfred</persName>'s descendants down to <persName key="Eadgar">Eadgar</persName>'s days, and the marked preference the West Saxon princes showed for the western part of their realm, prove that there was sympathy between them and their Celtic subjects, a sympathy which was tested in the struggle of the house of <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> against the Conqueror in <date value ="1067">1067</date>.</p>
  <p>Wales proper was the strongest Celtic state in Britain, even after <persName key="Offa">Offa</persName> (circa <date value="780">780</date>) had bounded it by his dyke, which runs from Chester to Chepstow behind the Wye, Severn, and Dee.
For a brief while King Roderick the Great (circa <date value="840">840</date>) united

 the country under his head-kingship, but at his death his three sons became each independent in his own little tribal realm, and there were kings of North Wales at Aberfraw, of South Wales at Cardigan, and of Powys or Mid-Wales at
Mathraval; while the smaller princedoms of Brecon, Gwent
[Monmouth], and Morganwg [Glamorgan] were practically ruled by their own lords. As in Ireland, these states were continually at war with each other, or with foes from without-Irish pirates from Leinster and Munster, Northern sea-rovers from Waterford and Dublin and the Orkneys and
Man, and English forays led by West Saxon or <placeName key="Marchland">Marchland</placeName> aldermen and kings.  Sorely pressed by the Danes, the
Welsh princes of North Wales, Brecon, and South Wales chose King <persName key="AElfred">Alfred</persName> as their patron <soCalled>"father and lord."</soCalled> And this relationship between the Welsh kinglets and the English head-kings was kept up to the very days of <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName> The hereditary friendship and alliance which seems to have existed between some of the South Welsh families and churches and the West Saxon kings may have had something to do with bringing this about. In the next reign we hear of Ethelfleda taking the Welsh Queen of Brecon prisoner and storming her town, and driving Ingimund the Northman (whom the North Welsh had called in to help them against her) out of Chester, the waste Roman city which he had made his stronghold, back to Ireland again. Yet
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> ransoms the South Welsh bishop from the Danes, and the Welsh princes bind themselves to him as they had to his father. For another short space (circa <date value="910">910</date>) there was a head-king in Wales. Howel the Good, the grandson of
Roderick, a peaceful ruler and a wise lawgiver, who <quote>"by the help of Blegwryd his clerk, and Morgeneu his judge,"</quote> drew up a set of rules for the court and laws for the people, which were passed by a great moot of the clergy and freemen of Wales at White House by the Tav in South Wales.
Howel is said to have made a pilgrimage to Rome to get these laws approved by the Pope. However, after Howel's death the peace he had kept was broken, and there were deadly wars between North Wales, South Wales, and Gwent just as before.</p>
  <p>During the next century the North Welsh princes were closely allied to the house of Leofric for two generations, but this alliance brought the Welsh high-king, Gruffydd, the son of <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName>, into a war in which he was defeated by
<persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName>'s son, and slain by his own subjects, his successors hastening to acknowledge the overlordship of


<pb id="p.189" n="189"/>



<persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</persName>.  Gruffydd's widow, Earl &#x00C6;lfgar's daughter, was married to <persName key="Harold II.">Harold</persName> in <date value ="1066">1066</date>, a match meant to bind the rival houses of Leofric and <persName key="Godwin">Godwine</persName> together.</p>
  <p>After the progress of William to S. Davids in <date value ="1081">1081</date>, when he received the homage of the Welsh princes, the complete subjection of the Welsh Church to <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> under <persName key="Anselm">Anselm</persName>, and the death of Rhys, the last prince who bore the name of king, <date value ="1196">1196</date>, the native rulers of Wales sink to the state of powerful and troublesome border barons. The Constable of
Chester and the Earl of Shrewsbury were the perpetual foes of the princes of Snowdonia (North Wales) and Powys; while
South Wales was conquered piece by piece by Norman knights, adventurers, who, intermarrying with the Welsh nobles, and profiting by their feuds, soon got a hold upon the land, which they made good by building strong castles, and filling them with hired soldiers, Flemings and Normans and English. These Lords Marchers, amongst whom the houses of Clare, Braos, and Mortimer were the most powerful and renowned, formed a distinct part of the English baronage, having full feudal rights over their land, which no lords in England ever had.  The settlement of the
Flemish soldiers of <persName key="Henry I.">Henry</persName> I. by Milford Haven, the expedition of <persName key="Strongbow, Richard">Strongbow</persName>, Fitz-Stephen, Fitz-Gerald, and the knight of Barry to Ireland from South Wales, and the part played by
Mortimer in the Barons' War, are perhaps the most striking features of the March history down to <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName>'s coronation.</p>
  <p>The princes of North Wales also had a fixed course of their own, they were the firm allies of the barons' party against the English suzerain, who favoured their eager enemies, the Lords Marchers. Only the difficulty of carrying on a campaign in the roadless, hilly, thickly-wooded Land of
Snowdon, and the skilful use the Welsh made of the political differences between the English kings and their barons, could, however, have saved them from complete overthrow.
One after another, <persName key="Henry I.">Henry I.</persName>, <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>, and <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, baffled by the obstacles of mountain warfare, were glad to accept their poor and restless vassals' submission and homage on easy terms.</p>
  <p>The last three lords of North Wales deserve more than bare mention. Llewelyn Jorwerth's son, though he married a daughter of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>, yet joined the army of God and the
Church, and is, like <persName key="Alexander III.">Alexander</persName>, the King of Scots, another of <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName>'s sons-in-law, specially named in the Great Charter.
As the ally of <persName key="Burgh, Hubert de">Hubert</persName> de Burgh and the Marshals in the next reign, he played the same wise part. His son and successor,

David (<dateRange from="1240" to="1246">1240-1246</dateRange>), had to buy the help of the English king against his brother Gruffydd by the surrender of the
Four Cantreds or Hundreds, a district on his north-eastern border, <date value ="1241">1241</date>. In <date value ="1244">1244</date>, however, he tried to establish the independence of his principality by giving Wales up to the Pope, agreeing to hold it as his vassal at an annual rent of 500 marks. But the Pope would not risk his friendship with the
English kings for the sake of Wales, and did little to help the Welsh in their struggles for freedom. On David's death, his nephew, <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> Gruffydd's son, had to make good his claim to the throne against his three brethren. Owen he imprisoned, but Roderick and David fled to the English court, where they were well received. <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName> had granted the Four Hundreds to his son <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName>, and as
<persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> allied himself, according to his foregoers' wont, with the Montforts and Despensers, he became opposed to his kinsman the king, and was soon brought into conflict with young <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName>, who was at this time the companion in arms and fast friend of Lord Mortimer and the Marchers, the Welsh prince's rivals. A revolt in the Four Hundreds against English misrule, a bitter border war year after year, increased the feud between them, which was not lessened by the presence of Welsh troops in Montfort's army at Lewes and Evesham. However, a peace was made in <date value ="1267">1267</date>, to which <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> agreed, by which the Four Hundreds were given back to <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName>, who was to pay 25,000 marks and do homage to the English king, who acknowledged him as
Prince of Wales, and liege lord of all Welsh barons save
Meredydd, the son of Rhys, who claimed to hold straight of
Henry as Prince of South Wales.</p>

For he said that his open enemies, David and Roderick (his exiled brothers), and Gruffydd, Prince of Powys (whom he had thrust from his land), were ever at King <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>'s table and sometimes in his Council in defiance of him. Neither prince would give way on this point; but matters were made worse in <date value ="1275">1275</date>, when Thomas Archer, a <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName> merchant, took a French ship off the Scillies, which was bearing to Wales <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName>'s betrothed,

<persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> in vain offered a ransom, <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> insisted on homage being paid before any other matter was settled.
In <date value ="1277">1277</date> the English king having marched into North Wales with a great host, while a second force entered Powys, and the Cinque Ports fleet guarded the Menai Straits, <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> was starved into surrender, and set his seal to the Treaty of
Conway, by which he gave up the Four Hundreds, promised to do homage every year, forgave and took back his three brethren, and paid a heavy fine to the king, who acknowledged him Prince of Wales for his life, gave him up his bride, and made him a marriage feast at London.</p>
  <p>But in <date value ="1281">1281</date> the faithless David quarrelled with his English neighbours, was reconciled with <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName>, and managed to get him to rise against <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>.   On Palm   Sunday,
<date value ="1282">1282</date>, in the midst of a thunder-storm, David burst into
Hawarden Castle, took prisoner the Chief-Justice of Wales,
Roger Clifford, and slew many of the unarmed garrison.
This signal of revolt was followed by a fierce raid into the
Marches, the siege and capture of several of <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>'s castles, and the raising of <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName>'s standard. <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> was angered by the princes' treason, but while he made ready for war, called out his knights, and got large grants of money from the clergy and barons, he did not stop the archbishop, John of Peckham, from going to Wales to try and settle a peace. Twice the good archbishop journeyed to
Wales and back to lay the Welsh grievances before <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>, who listened to them patiently, but insisted upon instant submission, at the same time offering as fair terms to the two princes as their continual breaches of faith would allow of--to <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> a thousand a year and an English earldom to him and his heirs for ever, in exchange for Snowdonia; to David a pilgrimage to the Holy Land during the king's pleasure, at the king's expense. But the Welsh barons answered,
<quote>"We dare not submit to <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>, nor will we suffer our prince to do so, nor do homage to strangers, whose tongue, ways, and laws we know nought of; we have only raised war in defence of our lands, laws, and rights."</quote> The archbishop in grief now excommunicated <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> and David; and
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> invaded Wales at once with a host, in which Scottish horsemen, Gascon men-at-arms, Bask foot-soldiers
(under Gaston of Beam, now the English king's faithful vassal), and Irish kernes served beside English knights and yeomen. After a check near Hope, the king was defeated at the bridge of boats he had made at the Menai Straits.
But he sent summons for fresh troops.</p>

Wherefore we now purpose, by the grace of God, to bring to an end the task of putting down their evil craft which we have lately undertaken by the advice of the peers and great men of our realm and the whole commonalty thereof, for the everlasting peace and quiet of ourself and our whole realm; for we hold it more fit and seemly that we and the dwellers in our land put ourselves to great toil and expense this once for the common good, to crush the wickedness of them altogether, heavy though the burden be, than that we allow ourselves to be tormented in times to come at their good pleasure by such risings as the

  <p>The Earl of Gloucester having beaten the South Welsh army, <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> left David to guard Snowdon, and with a small force went south to raise his friends for a flank attack upon the English. But Red Madoc Muckle-Mouth, the smith of Aberedwy, betrayed his path to his foes, and the traitors of Builth refused him help. He therefore crossed the river Irvon, 10th December <date value ="1282">1282</date>, and posting a guard at the bridge, waited for fresh troops at a barn in a little dingle.
<quote>"If all England were on the other bank, I am safe now,"</quote> he said.  But the party sent in pursuit by <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> found a ford, and crossing it fell suddenly upon the surprised Welshmen.   <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> hurried out to help his followers, but was thrust through and slain by the lance of Sir Adam of Frankton, who did not know whom he had overthrown. His head was cut off and sent to England, where it was borne through
Cheapside on a spear, with a crown of silver upon it, in mockery of the Welsh prophecy that <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName> should ride crowned through London; and finally set up on the Tower wreathed in ivy. David now took the title of Prince of
Wales, but he got scant help from the panic-stricken Welsh, and was soon driven an outlaw to the woods. In <date value ="1283">1283</date> he was betrayed by two of his own men to the English, and a

He describes the handsome, active men with long hair and moustache, but shaven chin, clad in coarse kirtle and cloak, bare-kneed, shod with brogues of raw hide, and the fair women with their linen wimples and dark gowns. He tells of their simple fare, dampers cooked on a girdle, buttermilk, and boiled or broiled meat; of their rude dwellings, bracken-thatched huts with walls of daub and wattle, where they sleep under a rug round an open fire in the old fashion of their British forefathers. He talks of the skilled spearmen of Snowdonia armed in short mail-coats and light helms and targets, and admires the mighty archers of South Wales, whose arrows smote through hides and mail like the bolts from a war-engine. He notes the skill of the
Welsh on harp and pipe and viol, and their love of poetry and singing. He praises their hospitality, their wit, their hardiness, their piety and charity, but blames their faithlessness and lack of perseverance, their cruel family quarrels and monstrous family pride.

Balliol at Berwick, November 30, <date value ="1292">1292</date>, who did homage for it at once to the English king. So far all had gone well, but trouble was ahead. By the Treaty of Amiens in <date value ="1279">1279</date>
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> had given up all claims to Normandy, and got quiet possession of Aquitaine and Ponthieu from Philip III. He had done homage to Philip IV., and had acted as umpire between the French princes and the King of Aragon in the quarrel over the crown of Sicily; but in spite of his good offices he found that the French king, who had beguiled him into giving up Gascony for a while, was eagerly seeking some means by which to overreach and despoil him.  In
<date value ="1293">1293</date> a quarrel broke out at S. Mahe in Brittany between the mariners of the Cinque Ports and the Norman shipmen, who took some English sailors and, by the order of
Charles, brother of the French king, hanged them to their yard-arms with dogs tied to their bodies.  The result was a sea-fight in which English, Gascons, and Irish fought against the Normans, French, Flemings, and Germans, and after great slaughter took most of their ships. Next year the English merchant fleet took sixty French ships laden with wine and threw their crews overboard.  <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> was summoned to Paris to answer for his subjects' behaviour in
Philip's Court of Peers. In vain he offered to submit the whole matter to umpires.  Philip refused all terms, and after a brief delay declared his fiefs forfeited.  <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> allied himself with the Emperor Adolphus, the King of
Aragon, the Earls of Flanders and Holland, called out the
English knights and yeomen, and named three Admirals, one for Yarmouth and the east coast, one for Portsmouth and the south coast, one for <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName> and the Irish coast.

  <p>Always willing to seek help and advice from his subjects in his difficulties, <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> had called the <hi rend="italics">Great Parliament of
<date value ="1295">1295</date></hi>, which was afterwards acknowledged as the model for such gatherings, as the three Estates were all present regularly summoned according to what henceforth was held to be the lawful and necessary form. In his summons to the archbishop, Robert of Winchelsea (John of Peckham was dead), he writes:-</p>
  <p><quote>Inasmuch as a most righteous law, established by the prudent foresight of the emperors, approves and ordains that what toucheth all should be looked to and agreed upon by all, so also it is very clear that common dangers should be met by proper measures agreed upon in common.
Thou knowest well, and it hath now gone forth, as we believe, through every region of the world, how the King of France hath deceitfully and by trick cheated me out of my land of Gascony, wickedly withholding it from me. But now, not satisfied with this deceit and wickedness, having gathered together to beset our realm a very great fleet and a mighty multitude of soldiers, with whom also he hath already attacked our realm and the inhabitants thereof, he proposeth, if his power equal this abominable and unrighteous design by him imagined (which thing
God forbid), to altogether wipe out the English tongue from the face of the earth.</quote></p>
  <p>Ere this Parliament met, <persName key="Balliol, John">Balliol</persName>'s treason became known to <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>, who thereupon sent his brother in his stead to
Gascony, and resolved to set out early next spring to Scotland. The Scottish earls began the war with a cruel raid into Cumberland, but <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> went up the east coast, crossed the Tweed, and attacked Berwick. The townsfolk, who had slain some English merchants in cold blood, were desperate, and mocked the king's offers. But the castle surrendered, and though thirty brave Flemings held out in the Red Hall till it was burned over their heads, the English burst in, March
30, <date value ="1296">1296</date>. The rich trading town was sacked, and the hapless burgesses massacred, so that <quote>" the blood ran down the streets like a mill-stream."</quote>  The Scottish king now sent formally to withdraw his homage, refusing to appear at <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>'s court.

 and being kindly received, gave back to <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> the kingdom of Scotland, owning that he had forfeited it, July 10, at
Brechin. <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>, seeing that all was now quiet, turned back from Elgin, and passing by Scone, took away the holy stone upon which the Scottish kings were wont to be crowned, the cross of S. Margaret, and all the royal ornaments of
Scotland, and sent them to Westminster, where the stone was set into a chair for the mass-priest at the high altar, and the crown, sceptre, and cross laid at the shrine of

Gascony from Philip, but was hampered by unlooked-for hindrances. The clergy under Robert of Winchelsea refused to vote him any money at the Parliament of Bury,
<date value ="1296">1296</date>, because of Pope <persName key="Boniface">Boniface</persName> VIII.'s Bull De
Clericis Laicos, which forbade Churchmen to pay or princes to levy taxes on Church pro-                     and Statute of perty.  But <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> met this as <persName key="John Lackland">John</persName> and
<persName key="Richard I.">Richard</persName> had done, by outlawing those who would not pay until they did so.</p>
  <p>At a Parliament at Salisbury, <date value ="1297">1297</date>, the king spoke: <q type="spoken">" I am the keep of the land, and you the towers and outworks of it.
My heritage, Gascony, I have lost by treachery, and I have vowed to get it back. It is your duty to help me in this.
Let no man excuse himself."</q> But the Marshal and Constable, the Earls of Norfolk and Hereford, refused to serve abroad unless the king himself went with them. <q type="spoken">" You shall go whether I go or no,"</q> said the king. <q type="spoken">" I am not bound to, nor will I," </q>answered the Marshal. Then the king grew angry, <q type="spoken">"By God, sir earl, you shall go or hang ! "</q>  <q type="spoken">By the same oath,"</q> replied Norfolk, <q type="spoken">" I will neither go nor hang !"</q>
He and his friends then left the court and gathered their party to them, 1500 knights, forbidding the king's officers to levy any taxes on their land. For <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> seeing the time slipping by, and determined to go to Flanders, where the towns had promised to help him against Philip, now seized all the wool at the seaports, forcing the merchants to pay a new and heavier duty, which they called male-tote,
<q type="spoken">"ill-toll,"</q> before he would let it pass.  He also sent for grain and meat from the sheriffs of the English counties, and all this without right, for he had not got the leave of
Parliament. Before he sailed, however, he spoke to the people from a stage put up outside Westminster Hall, his son and Archbishop Robert standing by his side. With

 tears in his eyes he begged them to forgive him for having ruled them  less well than he ought, but assured them that what he had taken from them he had taken in order that he might defend them with it against those who were thirsting for their blood.  <q type="spoken">"And now I am going to put myself in jeopardy for you, and I pray you, if I come back, to receive me well, and I will give you back all I have taken from you; but if I do not come back, then crown this my son as your king."</q> And the people wept, and held up their right hands, and swore to obey him. But the earls sent him a list of grievances, and when he sailed they summoned their friends in arms to a Parliament at London, where by the good offices of Robert of Winchelsea it was agreed that the king should confirm the Charters, levy no new kind of tax, or duty, or tallage save by consent of Parliament, and give up the male-tote of wools. This agreement, called the Confirmatio Cartarum or Articuli de Tallagio non concedendo, was sent over to
Ghent, where the king set his seal to it, November 5, <date value ="1297">1297</date>, to the joy of all. For the times were hard, and the people suffering a good deal, as the song of the time shows:-

By this Act the king was bound not to levy indirect taxes without consent of Parliament, but he might still lay tallages on the towns and the Crown estates. In the Parliament of
London, <date value ="1300">1300</date>, it was supplemented by the Articuli super
Cartas [fresh clauses to the Charters], which stopped the wrongdoing of the royal officers, settled  the choice and duties of the sheriff, and ordered a survey of the forests. In
<date value ="1301">1301</date>, at the Parliament of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, where the report of the survey was made, the barons begged the king to discharge his treasurer, Walter of Langton, Bishop of Lichfield, and demanded a final confirmation of the Charter, the carrying out of the forest reforms, the abolition of purveyance [forced purchase of goods for the king's use], the exact settlement of the judges' duties, and declared that these requests must be granted before they voted any money. <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> imprisoned the knight who brought up the bill, refused to change his treasurer, saying he had a right to order his household as he would, but gave way on the other points and confirmed the
Charters again. However, in <date value ="1305">1305</date> he got Clement V. to free him from all the oaths he had lately taken as against the royal rights, though in spite of this he did not break his word.</p>
   <p>The same year he ordered the sheriffs to take up all the
 gangs of Clubmen who were black-mailing and robbing in
 the country, and he further sent judges under Commission of
 Trail-baston [club-bearing] to try these evil-doers.  The
 outlaws did not relish these stern laws, and one of them  is
 made to say in a French poem of the day :-

  <date value ="1307">1307</date>, forbidding the clergy to send money abroad without

  treating it as Nebuchadnezzar did Jerusalem, that he had
  removed the good shepherd (the archbishop whom he had
  sent for to Rome to answer the king's complaints against
  him), and had put dumb, lazy, greedy hirelings in his room.
  They renewed the Complaints of <date value ="1260">1260</date>, and warned the Pope's

  things were going badly in Scotland. An
  outlawed squire of Galloway, <persName key="Wallace, William">William le Waleys</persName>
  [<persName key="Wallace, William">Wallace</persName>, i.e. the Welshman], who had been
  ill-used by the sheriff of Lanark, rose with a
  band of followers against the English ministers,
  to kidnap the Chief-Justice of Scotland,
  and failing, made a cruel raid into England, in which
  churches and abbeys were plundered, and helpless prisoners
  drowned. The king sent the Warden of Scotland, John of
  Warenne Earl of <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName> against them, and the Scottish
  nobles who had joined <persName key="Wallace, William">William</persName> at once gave in, and begged
  the earl to wait till they could pacify their countrymen.
  However, <persName key="Wallace, William">Wallace</persName> grew stronger by the delay, and when
  <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName> sent two black friars to him at Stirling, September
  10, <date value ="1297">1297</date>, to bid him surrender he answered, <q type="spoken">"Go back and
  tell the earl we are come here not to make peace, but to
  fight, to avenge ourselves and to free our land.  Let the
  English come on as soon as they will, we are ready and
  will withstand them to their beards."</q> The river that ran
  between the two armies was high, and the bridge was so
  narrow that but two knights could pass abreast on it: the
  Warden was therefore advised to wait before he attacked
  the Scots. But the Treasurer of Scotland, Canon Hugh
  of Cressingham, could not brook any delay and pushed
  across the bridge with the vanguard. <persName key="Wallace, William">William</persName> let them cross
  quietly and then dashed down to the bridge before the main
  body could follow, cutting off Hugh and his knights, who
  were soon slain, while their friends across the river looked



<pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

 on helplessly. The Warden and the rest of the English army fled in terror when <persName key="Wallace, William">Wallace</persName> crossed the bridge. Cressingham was so hateful to the Scots for his greed and cruelty that they made saddle-girths and sword-belts out of his skin.
<persName key="Wallace, William">Wallace</persName> was now joined by many Scottish nobles, and he and Andrew of Moray, the Seneschal of Scotland, called themselves <quote>"Wardens of the realm for King John."</quote> A truce having been made with Philip (which ended in the <hi rend="italics">Treaty of
Chartres</hi>, <date value="1299">1299</date>, and <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>'s marriage in <date value ="1300">1300</date> with the French king's sister Margaret), the king came home to England and hastened north to punish the rebels. As the two armies lay encamped face to face at Falkirk the morning before the battle, the king had two ribs broken by a kick from his horse, but he mounted another and rode forward to the field.
<persName key="Wallace, William">Wallace</persName> had skilfully planted his spearmen in thick squares behind a stockade of pales and ropes.  Between these squares were his archers, and on the flank his knights.<quote> " I have brocht you to the ring,"</quote> said he to his men when he had set them in array, <q type="spoken">"now hop [dance] gif ye can !</q>
However, the English cavalry scattered his archers, his knights treacherously fled without a blow, and the squares of pikemen, broken by the thick flights of English arrows, were ridden down and swept away. <persName key="Wallace, William">Wallace</persName> himself was forced to flee, turning, however, it is said, and slaying with his own hand the Prior of the Templars, who pursued him too closely.  His power was destroyed by this defeat, and he escaped to France, where he lay in hiding for seven years.</p>
  <p>The Scots now chose <persName key="Comyn, John">John Comyn</persName> the Red as regent for his uncle, King John, and the war lingered on, for they did not dare meet <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> in the field, and they were afraid to surrender after their repeated faithlessness.

With that <persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName> drew his sword in a rage and, leaning over the altar, struck his unarmed cousin a deadly blow, while Seton,
<persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName>' brother-in-law, stabbed Robert, <persName key="Comyn, John">John Comyn</persName>'s uncle.
<persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName> then rode into the town on <persName key="Comyn, John">Comyn</persName>'s own black charger, leaving his two kinsmen dying in the chancel. After this crime he had only two paths open, to flee the land at once or to make a bold bid for a kingdom. He chose the latter course, and was hastily crowned at Scone, March 25.
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> was furious at the murder of <persName key="Comyn, John">Comyn</persName>, the perjury of <persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName> and his abettors, and the fresh breach of the union he had worked so hard to bring about.

 taken and hanged; his wife and sister imprisoned.  But though he was tracked by bloodhounds and hunted by
Highlanders, Robert himself managed not only to keep out of the hands of his foes, but even to make head against them. In <date value ="1307">1307</date>
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> made up his mind to put down the rebellion at all hazards, and started with a huger host than before on a campaign which must have ended in complete success. <persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName>, terrified, sent to Prince
<persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> begging him to get terms for him; but the old king would not hear of anything but submission at mercy, and <persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName>, despairing, resolved to hold out to the death. However, <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> was taken ill and died at Burgh-on-Sands, by Solway Water,
Friday, July 7. He sent his last wishes to his son, bidding him go on with the army, bearing his bones with him till
Scotland was thoroughly subdued, ordering him to use the treasure of &#x00A3;32,000 to keep sevenscore knights for a crusade to the Holy Land, where he would have his heart buried, praying him to cherish his stepmother and his half-brothers, and forbidding him to recall <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Piers of Gaveston</persName> (who had lately been banished) without leave of Parliament. All which things the Prince promised under pain of his father's curse.</p>
   <p><persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>'s form and looks are often spoken of by the chroniclers. He was stronger, bigger, and taller than most men, deep-chested, thin-flanked, with long limbs, which gave him great power in swordsmanship, riding, and tilting. His face was handsome and stern, only blemished by the falling eyelid which he inherited from his father; his hair was flax- fair in his childhood, dark brown in his manhood, and silver-white in his old age.  He was a good and ready speaker, in spite of a slight stammer, and his voice was deep and strong. He kept his full health and strength till within a few days of his death, though his life had been rough and restless. He was as pious and duteous to his kinsfolk as his father had been, as good a knight and as quick a general as Richard Lion-heart, and as wise and hard-working a king as <persName key="Henry II.">Henry</persName> of Anjou.  He was truthful, holding ever to his device, <quote>"Keep faith ;"</quote> pitiful, boasting that no man had ever prayed him for mercy and been refused; careful of his money, his time, and his servants, and proud of his strict justice to evil-doers. He was never afraid of confessing his mistakes, and he took pains to show his people that he trusted and cared for them, and sought their love and trust in return. There are many stories that set forth his dutifulness, courage, and princely heart. How he fought Adam of Gordon, a tried and stalwart knight of Montfort's party,



<pb id="p.207" n="207"/>

 single-handed, overcame him, and gave him his life, after
Evesham. How he swam a river to get at and chastise an insolent groom, whom he forgave when the fellow in great terror begged pardon for his rudeness.  How at Stirling, when his horse was slain by a bolt from an arblast, he turned round to hismen, who begged him to withdraw out of range of the castle, with the words, <quote>"A thousand shall fall beside me, and ten thousand at my right hand, but their arrows shall not come nigh unto me to do me hurt, for the Lord is with me."</quote> He had indeed had many narrow escapes from death. Once a huge stone fell from the roof of the room on the very place where he had just been sitting; another time the lightning struck his bedroom and killed two pages that were standing before him; a third time, his horse, frightened by the sails of a mill, leapt over the wall at
Winchelsea, falling many feet down to the road beneath, which luckily happened to be a muddy one, without hurting himself or his rider.  But though he believed himself to be specially guarded by God, <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> did not give way to superstition nor let his feelings mislead his reason. When a beggar pretended that his eyes had been opened by praying at King <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName>'s tomb, he drove the man away, to his mother's displeasure, saying, <q type="spoken">" My father would rather have had such a lying rascal blinded than given him back his eyesight."</q> Yet he held his father in deep love and respect.
A knight once came to him and complained that a Jewish usurer had refused to do him justice, saying that he had leave by charter from King Henry not to appear before any judge but the king himself.  Said <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>, <q type="spoken">"It does not become a son to make void his father's promises, but I will give you leave in another charter to do what you like to this
Jew without being obliged to answer for it save to me."</q>
When the Jew heard this he at once agreed to forego King
Henry's charter and do justice to his creditor.</p>
  <p>What <persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName>'s people thought of him is shown in their deep grief for his death and the way in which they looked back to his reign as a time of peace and good laws. One song says:-
  <quote rend="blockquote"><l>When he reigned over England, he made the law to stand,</l>
<l>  By Reason and by Righteousness he held the realm in hand, </l>
<l>  With Wisdom, Strength, and Bravery, in which he did abound; </l>
<l>  For ruling of a kingdom his peer was never found."</l></quote> 
  And his dirge runs:-

     <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName>, now twenty-three years old, was a
     strong, handsome young man, brave, well-spoken, and able,
     but headstrong, careless of all but his own pleasures, and
     given overmuch to the companionship of those beneath him,
     idling his time away with actors, jugglers, craftsmen, and
     labourers, when he ought to have been learning and doing his
     duty as a peer and counsellor. His folly angered his father,
     who drove him from court for six months when he broke
     the treasurer's park and slew his deer, and could not refrain
     from striking him when he begged the earldom of Ponthieu,
     his mother's portion, for his bosom friend <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName>.  <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Piers</persName>
     or Peter of Gaveston was the son of a Gascon knight who
     with his wife had been put to death by the French; Queen
     Eleanor had brought the orphan to her court and made him
     the playmate of her son, over whom he got the most un     bounded power.  <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Piers</persName> is spoken of as a good
     knight, a gifted man, and a skilful soldier;
     but his pride and greed made him hateful, and
     his power over <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> was not used for any good. The new
     king began his reign by breaking his father's dying wishes.

He sent his father's body to Westminster to be buried; went south himself, though there was every hope, if he had used the power he had, of crushing the rebellion of <persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName> at one blow; and recalled <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName>, making him Chamberlain,
Earl of Cornwall, marrying him to his niece, and enriching him with his father's treasure and the jewels of the crown.
He then dismissed the treasurer and others of the Council who had offended himself or his friends in times past, and appointing the newly-made earl Warden of the Realm, crossed to Boulogne. Here, having done homage for his duchy of Aquitaine, he married the French princess, Isabel,
January 28, <date value ="1308">1308</date>, amid great feasting and merry-making.
On his return he was crowned at Westminster, February 25, when he swore a special oath <quote>"to hold and keep the laws and righteous customs which the commonalty of the realm should choose."</quote></p>
  <p>Very soon the king's folly and extravagance, and <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName>'s open contempt of the Earls of Hereford, Warenne, Pembroke, Warwick, and Lancaster, whom he thwarted in the
Council, overthrew in the tournament, and mocked with nicknames (calling Pembroke <soCalled>"Joseph the Jew,"</soCalled> Warwick
<soCalled>"the black dog of Arden,"</soCalled> and Lancaster <soCalled>"the old man"</soCalled> or
<soCalled>"the mummer"</soCalled>), led to the exile of the favourite at the
Council of London. The king made him Warden of Ireland, and there he ruled well and was much liked. However, in
<date value ="1309">1309</date>, the Parliament of Westminster brought forward certain
Articles prohibiting (a) the wrongdoings and illegal tolls taken by the king's officers; (b) the delays and evasions of justice; (c) the new customs upon the foreign merchants, who were not protected by the Charter; (d) the wrong use of the king's right of purveyance.  The king agreed to these at Stamford <date value ="1309">1309</date>, and by the persuasion of the Earl of
Gloucester the Parliament allowed of <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName>'s return.</p>
   <p>2. But the greatest of the English barons, the king's
 cousin Thomas, son of Edmund Crouchback King of Sicily,
 and Blanche dowager Queen of Navarre, Earl of Lancaster,
 Leicester, and Derby, and heir by marriage to <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> and
 Salisbury, was by no means pleased with the king's rule.
 And as there were many men, rich and poor, who had grievances which they saw little chance of getting removed by the
 careless, ease-loving king or his proud and lazy ministers,
 Earl Thomas soon had a large party at his back. The king
 forbade armed gatherings, but the barons paid no heed to his
 decree and came in full force to a Parliament at Westminster
 in Lent <date value ="1310">1310</date>, and chose a board of seven bishops, eight earls,

While the Ordainers were sitting the king and <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName> made a raid into Scotland, in which they drove their foes before them, but did not succeed in stopping the war by the capture of the rebel leaders.</p>
  <p>In <date value ="1311">1311</date>, leaving <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName> at Bamborough, <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> came back and met the Parliament at London. He had already agreed to the first six Ordinances ere he went north, touching-
  <quote>(a) The keeping of the Charters, (b) the peace, and (c) the rights of the Church; (d) forbidding the king to make any gifts without the
Ordainers' consent; (e) ordering the customs to be paid to English collectors, and (f) making the foreigners to whom they had hitherto been paid give account of their receipts.</quote></p>
  <p>He now had to agree to a second set of Ordinances, by which-
  <quote>(a) <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName>, " who had misled the king, turned away his heart from his people, and wrought all kinds of wrong-doing," was to be banished and forfeit his estates; the Italian merchants who had lent the king money and taken the taxes were to be sent out of England; and Henry of Beaumont, whom <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> had made King of Man (which had been lately taken from the Scots), was to leave the Council.
  (b) All the king's ministers in England, Ireland, and Gascony are to be chosen by the king with the counsel and consent of the baronage.
  (c) The king may not go to war, leave the realm, raise an army, or change the coinage without consent of the barons in Parliament.
  (d) Parliaments are to be held once at least every year to hear and decide suits and complaints.
  (e) The new prises [forced tolls], customs, afforestings, taxes on foreign merchants, are forbidden.
  (f) Justice was made more sure and severe.
  (g) The former Ordinances, Statutes, and Charters are confirmed.</quote></p>

  <p><persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> complained that he was treated like an idiot, since he was no longer allowed to rule his own house or choose his own servants; but after in vain praying the barons to forgive <quote>"his brother <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Piers</persName>,"</quote> he gave way, sent <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName> to Brabant, and sealed the Ordinances. However, as soon as he got back to <placeName key="York">York</placeName> by counsel of certain French lawyers he set aside the articles touching <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName> and replaced him in his former rank and estates.  Earl Thomas and his friends at once armed, and beset <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName> in Scarborough till he gave himself up on the understanding


<pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

 that he should be kept safe till peace was arranged. But as he was being taken to Wallingford the Earl of Warwick, his deadly foe, seized him by a sudden surprise from the Earl of Pembroke, in whose safeguard he was, and took him before the Earls of Lancaster and Hereford. As he was led to his enemies he cried, <quote>" Where are all my riches with which
I bought friends, and where are the friends in whom I put my trust? It is my pride, the king's favour, and the court that have brought me to this hopeless pass."</quote> He prayed the
<soCalled>"gentle Earl"</soCalled> Thomas for pity, and some present would have sent him back to Pembroke, but others said, <quote>" We have got the wolf by the ears, shall we let him go to hunt him again ?"</quote> and Earl Thomas bade two Welsh soldiers take him away forthwith and strike off his head, for as he was a Roman citizen and a kinsman of the Earl of Gloucester by marriage they would not put him to a shameful death. So his head was cut off at Blacklow at noonday and borne by a black friar to
<persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName>, June 19, <date value ="1312">1312</date>. The king was furious at the murder of his friend and made ready to revenge him. It was only by the good offices of the Earl of Gloucester, the Pope, and the King of France that a civil war was stopped, and the king reconciled to the four earls, Lancaster, Hereford,
Warren, and Warwick, October 16, <date value ="1313">1313</date>. The birth of his eldest son, November 13, <date value ="1312">1312</date>, had delighted <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName>, and from that moment he began somewhat to forget his grief for his dead friend.</p>
  <p>In <date value ="1309">1309</date> Pope Clement sent a bull to the English bishops saying he had found the Templars in France guilty of heresy, idolatry, murder, and evil living, and ordering the archbishop to see into the state of the Order in England. The English

All this while <persName key="Bruce, Robert">Robert Brus</persName> had been profiting by the divisions in England to win back castle after castle from the English garrisons by stratagem or storm, and at last he beset Stirling so straitly that the governor promised to yield it unless he were relieved by St. John's Day, <date value ="1314">1314</date>. <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> was willing to fight the Scots, but Lancaster and his friends, who cared only to hold power, pretended that a Parliament must be called ere the king could lawfully set out, and refused to join his host. <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName>, however, made up his mind to save
Stirling, and with Gloucester and a great host he faced King

On the 23rd June an attempt to relieve the castle was balked by the
Scottish spearmen, and King Robert, who was mounted on a little hackney marshalling his men, with his own hand slew a fully-armed English knight who challenged him, parrying his lance-thrust and cleaving his head with his axe. Next morning the English archers began the attack, but the Scottish cavalry drove them back, and the English knights were forced to charge the unbroken squares of pikemen. In the confusion a number of the Scottish camp-followers were seen coming down the hill with flags and pikes, and the Englishmen took them for a fresh host, and turned in flight. The Earl of
Gloucester was left to die fighting bravely alone, the English king, whose horse was killed under him, was forced out of the fray against his will, and saved by the unselfish courage of Sir Giles of Argentein.  The Scots pursued fiercely, killing all they could come up with, and winning great spoil.

Brus was crowned King of Ireland at Dundalk in <date value ="1315">1315</date>. With an army of Irish clansmen and 6000 Scottish soldiers he defeated the English troops of the Pale till he was checked at
Athonree, where 11,000 of the O'Connors fell. But his brother
Robert came to his help in the fall of the same year, <date value ="1317">1317</date>, and the two kings swept through the whole land from Belfast to Killarney with fire and sword. However Robert was soon called home, where he busied himself with the siege of Berwick and raids into North England, and now the English of the Pale under Lord Mortimer defeated, and under John of Birmingham overthrew, the invaders at Faughard, near

Decrees went forth stopping the malting of grain because of the lack of barley for bread, and fixing the maximum price for meat and flour and beer and other food. The rich had scarce enough to live on, and were obliged to withhold their usual alms of meat and drink from the poor. The people were driven to live on carrion; many were killed by the bands of hungry robbers that roamed about seeking for food, and many were starved to death. At last a third party was formed by the Earl of Pembroke, who had not forgiven
Lancaster for the dishonour he did him in seizing <persName key="Gaveston, Piers de">Gaveston</persName> while under his safeguard: and when Berwick was taken by
King Robert, a second peace was patched up between Earl
Thomas and the king, by which the Ordinances was agreed to, and a Standing Council of eight bishops, four earls, four barons, and a knight, named. But still nothing was done to better matters, Lancaster kept up a secret understanding with the Scots, who, 20th September <date value ="1319">1319</date>, beat the <placeName key="York">York</placeName>shire levy under the archbishop in a battle called The Chapter of
Mytton, from the number of clergy that were slain there, and <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> had to make a truce with the victors. A quarrel now broke out on the Welsh borders between Roger Mortimer, the grandson of <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName>'s friend, and the son of Hugh the Despenser, who had married one of Gloucester's sisters.
Hereford and Lancaster took Lord Mortimer's part, and at a Parliament in <date value ="1321">1321</date> the Despensers, father and son, were exiled for abusing their influence over the king, for preventing the peers from seeing and speaking to him, for raising civil war and hindering justice. The outlaws left the kingdom, and the younger Despenser fitted out a small fleet of ships and plundered the merchants in the Channel.  But they were not long in exile. Lady Badlesmere refused to let
Queen Isabel into Leeds Castle in <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, and slew some of her followers. The barons, disgusted at this insolence, came to help <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName>, and Lancaster, who had a quarrel with Lord

 timers were forced to yield, and ere Lancaster, who was now alarmed, could gather his troops the king had won all the strongholds of the Midlands. Still Thomas would not take the king's offer of pardon, but with the Earl of Hereford turned to bay at Borough Bridge, March 16, <date value ="1322">1322</date>, where
Sir Andrew Harclay, the royal general, won the day, slaying
Hereford and taking Thomas himself.      The earl was brought to Pomfret, tried by the Peers for treason, and led out by the Gascon soldiers to be beheaded in an old striped coat and broken hat, seated on a white nag, bridleless and saddleless, the people pelting him with mud and mocking him as <quote>" King Arthur."</quote> At a little hill outside the town he was made to dismount and kneel down with his face to the north, <quote>"toward his friends the Scots."</quote>  <q type="spoken">"King of Heaven, have mercy on me !"</q> he said, <q type="spoken">"for the king on earth hath forsaken me !"</q> and a headsman from London struck off his head. Eight barons and thirty knights and squires met the same end. In a Parliament at <placeName key="York">York</placeName> the Acts against the
Despensers were annulled, all the old articles of the Ordinances confirmed, but the new ones set aside as not having been rightly made in full Parliament. It was at the same time laid down solemnly that <quote>" all matters to be established for the estate of our lord the king and his heirs, the realm and people, shall be treated, granted, and established in Parliaments by our lord the king, and by the consent of the clergy, earls, and barons, and the commonalty of the realm."</quote>  The king now had a good chance of governing well, but he left all to his new favourites the Despensers, made a truce with the Scots, angered the Londoners by his stern justice, and let his prisoners escape. The taxes were not paid, the law was not kept, the people in their despair held Earl Thomas for a martyr and a saint, and grew bitter against the careless king and the greedy ministers.</p>

The queen's open fondness for <persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName> at length forced her brother Charles to send her out of France, but she went to Hainault, and betrothing her son to the earl's daughter Philippa, got 2000 soldiers from him with which to carry out her plans. Money she had already borrowed from her brother and the Italian bankers in France.  In vain <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> wrote kindly to her, urging her return to her duty.<note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> un-kinged and murdered, <date value ="1327">1327</date></note>

She was joined by the fleet sent to stop her, by most of the
English barons and bishops, and by the Londoners, bands of whom, called <note place="foot" n="5">"Riflers,"</note> rose, plundered the houses of the king's friends, and murdered the Bishop of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, keeping the city in such disorder that no courts could be held for months. The little Duke of Aquitaine was made Warden of the Realm, and not a hand was raised on his father's behalf.
The Despensers, who had fled to the west, were caught, tried, and hanged as traitors. The king, after hiding for a while in
Wales, where the yeomen and monks favoured his flight and helped to conceal him, gave himself up, and was sent a prisoner to Kenilworth. At a Parliament at Westminster, Adam of
Orleton, Bishop of Hereford, a deadly enemy of the king's and a man without pity or fear, asked those present whether they would have the father or son as their king. Save four bishops all voted for the son. <persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> was charged with having been foolishly led by evil counsellors ; with neglecting the business of his state, and trifling his time away unbecomingly; with having lost Ireland, Gascony, and Scotland; with harming the
Church, and slaying, exiling, and outlawing many great men; with breaking the oath he made at his crowning to do justice to all, and with having ruined the realm, being incapable of ruling better or of mending his ways. Twenty-four commissioners-earls, barons, abbots, priors, judges, friars, monks, knights, and citizens--were sent to Kenilworth to renounce the homage and fealty they had sworn to the king, who agreed to give up his crown to his son and to become a

Eight months afterward the wretched man, who had been moved about as a prisoner from one dungeon to another, was cruelly murdered by <persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName>'s orders at Berkeley Castle, 21st September <date value ="1327">1327</date>.</p>
  <p><persName key="Edward II.">Edward</persName> was justly put from the throne, for he had shown himself unfit to rule, and had brought great misery on his people by his neglect of his duty; but those that had withstood him were selfish and greedy men, who cared only for their own advancement, and they were only successful in the end because the people in their sore distress (for a drought was now killing off the cattle the plague had spared) believed that the bad seasons were sent as a punishment for their rulers' sins, and therefore thinking that any change must be for the better, were willing to have a young king who would learn to govern well.</p>
  <p>In this reign the power of the Parliament grew greater, and the Estates set about getting the whole control of the taxes into their hands; but it was not yet found possible for the king to rule save by ministers whom he himself chose, though it was settled that he must choose men who would not be hateful to the nation.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III: Edward III 1327-1377</head>

        

  <p>1. On the 29th January the young king was crowned, and on the 3rd February Parliament met. A Standing Council of fourteen was appointed, Henry, Earl of Lancaster (the late earl's brother and heir), being Warden of the realm, was its chairman; with him were the king's uncles <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> and Norfolk, and his kinsman Warenne, the Bishop of Hereford (who was treasurer), the two archbishops, and the Bishop of Winchester, with six barons. The Parliament then blotted out the sentence against Earl Thomas, and the king confirmed the Charters, gave a full and new charter to London, made decrees for the better maintaining of justice, and set keepers of the peace in every county.  In spite, however, of the
Warden and the Council all real power lay in the hands of the queen-mother and of <persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName>, who kept a guard of 180 knights and lived in such state that his own son warned him he was behaving like a May-day king. In <date value ="1328">1328</date> the Scots war broke out again, and <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>, with his mother and

 <note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName>'s rule.  The Shameful Peace, <dateRange from="1327" to="1328">1327-1328</dateRange>.</note>
<persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName>, at the head of 8000 knights and squires, 30,000 men-at-arms, horse and foot, and 24,000 archers, marched north to drive back the Scots, who had already got into England.  The Scottish army and its ways of warfare are thus described by one who saw them: <quote>" The Scots are bold, hardy, and well inured to war.
When they make their inroads into England they march from twenty to twenty-four miles without halting night or day, for they are all horsed save the camp followers. Knights and squires on large bay horses, and the common folk on
Galloway ponies, which are never tied up or groomed, but turned out straightway after the day's march to graze on the moor or the meadows. They bring no carts with them because of the hills they have to pass, nor do they carry any bread or wine with them, for they are used to such plain living that in time of war they will live many days on halfsodden flesh without bread, drinking spring water instead of wine. They have therefore no need for pots or pans, for they boil the flesh of the cattle in their skins when they have flayed them. Nor do they drive cattle with them, for they are sure to find plenty in the land they are invading. Every man carries under the flaps of his saddle a broad plate of iron, and behind him a little bag of oatmeal. When they have eaten too much of the boiled flesh and feel weak and empty, they set their plate over the fire, mix a little oatmeal with water, and when the plate is heated put some of this paste upon it and make a thin cake like a biscuit, which they eat to comfort their stomachs."</quote>  In this way the Scots entered England, destroying and burning everything on their way. They were in number 4000 knights and squires and
20,000 soldiers. The king being now old and stricken with leprosy had set as captains over them his renowned nephew
Randolf, Earl of Moray, and Sir James Douglas, who was held the bravest and most enterprising knight in the two kingdoms. And the Scots pillaged within five miles of the
English host, yet the English could not bring them to battle nor discomfit them. For some time the two armies lay face to face, and one night <quote>"Lord William Douglas took with him 200 men-at-arms and suddenly brake into the English host about midnight, crying, <q type="spoken">'Douglas! Douglas! ye shall all die, thieves of England !'</q> And they slew ere they ceased
300 men, some in their beds, some half ready; and Douglas struck his horse with the spurs and came to the young king's own tent, always crying <q type="spoken">'Douglas!'</q> and cut asunder two or three cords thereof with his sword."</quote> The English guard


<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>
   <note type="header"  place="head">[<dateRange from="1328" to="1332">1328-1332</dateRange>]</note>
 rallied and saved the king; however, Douglas got back unharmed to his own folk. At last the Scots army stole away during the night, and the next day the English found their camp empty, save that there were <quote>"more than 500 slaughtered oxen lying there which they had killed, as they could not have driven them fast enough to take them with them, and more than 300 kettles made of hide with the hair outside, full of meat and water, hung on the fires ready for boiling, and more than 1000 spits of wood with meat on them for roasting, and over 10,000 pair of worn-out brogues of undressed hide which the Scots had left."</quote> The English, who had been half starved as the country was stripped so bare, got a good meal that day, but they could not push on further.
So the young king came back with sorrow and without honour, but men said <quote>"that the Scots could have been brought to battle if <persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName> had not betrayed his lord, taking meed and money from the Scots to the intent that they might get away privily by night without fighting."</quote> Soon after [March
17, <date value ="1328">1328</date>] was made the Shameful Peace at Northampton, by which <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> gave up all claims over Scotland, promised to marry his sister Joan of the Tower to David, King
Robert's son, and agreed to give back the Scottish crown jewels, while the Scots were to pay &#x00A3;20,000 for the hurt they had done the English by their raids.</p>
  <p>2. This peace was made by the queen-mother and the
Earl of March, and it displeased the English barons, who were already disgusted at the evil life these two led and at their greed, for they held all the estates of the Despensers and the most part of the Crown lands. It was not worth while to have overthrown former favourites to be ruled by a fresh one. Lancaster tried to get the king's uncles to rise against <persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName>. And they promised him help, but left him in the lurch at the last, and he was obliged to make his peace with March. However, the Earl of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> did not escape, for he was tried, condemned, and beheaded, March 19,
<date value ="1330">1330</date>, by reason of certain letters which he had written to his brother, whom he believed to be still alive in Corfe Castle.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="2">Mortier is overthrown, October 20, <date value ="1330">1330</date>. </note>But
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> was now married to Philippa of Hainault, and felt himself old enough to rule alone; he therefore readily listened to Lancaster and his friends, who showed him the misdeeds of his mother and <persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName>, and begged him to end their ill rule. Accordingly on 19th October <date value ="1330">1330</date> the young king suddenly broke into the queen-mother's room  at
Nottingham, by a secret passage which had been left unguarded,


<pb id="p.221" n="221"/>

 and arrested the Earl of March as a traitor, though
Isabel prayed him to <quote>"have mercy upon her gentle <persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Mortimer</persName>." </quote>
The captive earl was soon tried and found guilty of the murder of <persName key="Edward II.">Edward II.</persName>, of taking upon himself the rule of the realm against law and right, of robbing the king of the money paid by the Scots, and of other crimes, and was put to death as a traitor. The queen-mother was sent to
Castle Risings, where she spent many years quietly in safe keeping. The young king now for a while gave himself up to pleasure. There were splendid tournaments held at Dartmouth, Stepney, and Cheapside. At the second the king and fifteen knights challenged all comers for three days, riding through the city to the lists in kirtles and cloaks of green cloth lined with red silk, embroidered all over with arrows in gold, their squires following in white kirtles with the right sleeves green and gold-embroidered like their masters. In the third, in Cheapside, the king and fifteen knights appeared masked in Tartar dresses, with long furred gowns and tall caps, every knight having on his right hand a masked lady dressed in a gown of red velvet with a white camlet cape, who led him by a silver chain fastened to his wrist, while sixty squires in one livery went before, with a band of musicians playing trumpets and other instruments, as the company rode two and two through the city.</p>

 no avail, and at last, weary of the French king's covert enmity, he resolved upon open war. To this course many things combined to draw him. There was the old grudge between the English and French kings for several generations owing to their respective claims upon Normandy and
Gascony. There were the persuasions of the French exiles at the English Court, especially Robert, Earl of Artois,

Philip's brother-in-law, who had done his best to get Philip chosen King of France, but had afterward been deprived of his inheritance and driven abroad by his kinsman. There was the danger of letting the French get hold of the great cities of the Low Countries, which were the chief markets for
English wool and goods, and our traders were eager to help the men of Ghent, against their lord the Earl of Flanders, whose cause was upheld by Philip.  Accordingly in <date value ="1337">1337</date>
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> gave out that he was about to go to war with
Philip to recover his lawful heritage the crown of France, in spite of the warning letters of Pope <persName key="Benedict">Benedict</persName> XII. (who was afraid of his joining the Emperor Lewis of Bavaria against himself), and he soon afterwards took the title and arms of King of France. The English nobles were not at all displeased to follow a brave young knight to a war in which they ran no danger of hardship or famine, but had good hope of rich plunder and heavy ransom from wealthy prisoners, even if they did not win broad lands and high titles.
The English merchants who had suffered by the French and
Scottish sea-rovers were glad to think that piracy would be stopped in the Channel, and that they would be able to pay back the Norman privateers for the damage they had done to the coast towns. The English churchmen did not care for the popes, now that they were living at Avignon, away from Rome their own city, and in the power of the French king, and they were glad that they would not be obliged to pay these <soCalled>"French popes"</soCalled> so much money or to see the

 best preferments given to their foreign favourites. The Grey
Friars and the <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> Scholars had warmly taken the side of the Emperor Lewis of Bavaria in his struggle against <persName key="John XXII">John XXII</persName>. and <persName key="Benedict XII.">Benedict XII</persName>. The English people, as far as they thought at all about it, were glad to help their young king to win a fresh kingdom, and liked the thought of having a blow at the French, their old foes. <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> did not go to war without allies. The Emperor Lewis, who saw a chance of using him as a cat's-paw against France, agreed to aid him; the Low Country lords, the Dukes of Brabant and Guelders, the Earl of Hainault, the Archbishop of Cologne and others, wellwishers or kinsfolk, also joined him; and he made friends with James of Artaveldt, the Master-Brewer of Gaunt, who was the leader of the great towns of Flanders and a sturdy hater of the French. Philip on his part found friends in the
Kings of Navarre, Sicily, and Scotland, who sided with him out of kinship or need, and in John, King of Bohemia, who was the rival of Lewis and head of the imperial house of
Luxemburg.</p>
  <p>5. The first campaign of a struggle which was to occupy three generations of Englishmen and Frenchmen was not very glorious to either side. <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> landed in Flanders, went to Coblentz, when the Emperor sold him the Vicariate of the West of the Empire, and then with more than 30,000 men beset Cambray.  But this city was too strong to be carried by storm; and when the English began to make raids into France the German nobles and knights refused to join them. The French king, who had 100,000 men in his host, would not fight a pitched battle, though the armies lay face to face for some days. By the end of <date value ="1339">1339</date>, <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> having spent all his money and exhausted his credit, was obliged to go home for more. His Parliament received him well, and granted him large supplies, while he agreed to several useful and notable statutes.  The first orders the sheriffs to be yearly appointed in the Exchequer Court, and limits purveyance; the second completes the Confirmatio Cartarum by abolishing tallage of any kind, even on domain land, without consent of Parliament the third declaring that the English crown shall never be under the French crown, though both be held by one man ; the fourth- frees the clergy from purveyance and other royal exactions. Meanwhile Philip had set a large army on the Flemish marches, and gathered a fleet of 500 ships at Sluys under Sir Hugh Kiriel the Breton, Sir
Peter Bahucet a Norman, and Blackbeard the Genoese corsair, to stop the landing of the English and cripple their

Christofer in <date value ="1338">1338</date>. On June 22nd <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> sailed
 with 300 ships against them in spite of his Council's advice, and on the 24th, <quote>" at the dawn when the sun was rising, he beheld his foes so strongly
    arrayed that they were very terrible to look at, for the ships of
    the French fleet were so strongly lashed together with great
    chains, and fitted with great castles, brettices, and barricades.
    Nevertheless Sir <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> our king spake to all those that were
    about him of the English fleet: <q type="spoken">'Fair lords and brethren,
    be not dismayed for aught, but be all of good courage, for he
    that shall do battle for me to-day, and shall fight with a good
    brave heart, will have the blessing of God Almighty, and
    every man shall have whatever he can take.'</q> Then our
    sailors hoisted their sails half-mast high, and hauled up their
    anchors as if they were about to fly; and when the French
    navy saw this they unlashed their great chains to follow us,
    and with that our ships sailed back upon them, and the
    battle began with the sound of trumpets, drums, viols, and
    tabors and other kinds of music."</quote></p>
      <p><quote rend="blockquote"><l>'And the wavering wind that rose out of the west,</l>
<l>        Blowing blithely and fair in the breadth of our sails, </l>
<l>        Drove the big burly cogs [great ships] aboard of each other. </l>
<l>        So strongly our stems struck the bows of their galleys </l>
<l>        That the breastworks and bulwarks were bursten asunder.	</l>
<l>        Then we cast across grapplings from one craft to the other, </l>

 and proved that the English archers, rightly used, were better than any foot-soldiers who could be brought against them.
It also forced Philip to give up all plans for carrying the war into England. <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> then with his allies besieged Tournay, <quote>"assaulting it six times a day, with his springalds and mangonels [catapults and war-slings] casting huge stones, and with engines of powder and fire [cannons], so that these engines with their huge stones broke down the towers and the strong walls, churches, belfries, strong halls, fine buildings, and rich dwellings throughout the said city; and the people within the city were all but perished by reason of the great famine that was in the city, for they were so straitly held that the quarter of barley was worth &#x00A3;4 sterling [equal to L50], the quarter of oats 2 marks, an egg 6d., two onions for a penny."</quote> And they must have yielded up the town if <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> had not been willing, for lack of money to go on with the siege, to make a truce, September
25, at Esplocin, at the prayer of the Countess Dowager of Hainault, <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s mother-in-law  and Philip's sister.
Not being able to get silver from England, the young king hurried home secretly, November 30, leaving his cousin and other nobles with the Flemings in pledge for his debts.
Next day he turned out all the ministers, the chief-justices, and other of his servants from their offices, believing them to have misused their power and kept back his moneys.
John of Stratford, Archbishop of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, the head of the ministry, fled to sanctuary, and denying the charges brought against him by the king's libellus famosus [pamphlet of accusations], refused to make answer save before his peers in
Parliament. But the king denied him the entry to the House till a committee of lords reported that <hi rend="italics">peers, whether royal officers or not, cannot be pit to judgmment, nor lose goods or land, nor be arrested, outlawed, or judged, save in full Parliament before the Peers</hi>, when <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> gave way, and was reconciled with John.  Before fresh supplies were granted the king was obliged first to promise (a) that all moneys received should be audited by a board chosen in Parliament, and (b) that he would not choose ministers without consent of his Council, and (c) that at each Parliament ministers were to resign and be compelled to answer all complaints before they could be reappointed. But when he had got his money,

  <p>6. A fresh dispute between Philip and <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> arose in
<date value ="1341">1341</date>, upon the death of John, Duke of Brittany, whose duchy was claimed by his half-brother John, Earl of Montfort, and by Philip's nephew, Charles of Blois, husband of the dead duke's niece Joan.   Charles was adjudged duke by the peers of France, but Montfort would not accept

 their ruling, and crossing to England, claimed help of
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>. Soon after his return he was taken prisoner, but his wife, Joan of Flanders, held out in Hennebon against the
French and Charles of Blois till she was relieved by Sir
Walter Mauny, the gallant knight of Hainault, whom <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> sent to help her. This succour was followed by forces under
Robert, Earl of Artois, who was made Earl of Richmond, and an army under <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> himself; but the French party were too strong to be driven out, and Pope Clement VI. obtained a truce, <date value ="1343">1343</date>, by which John of Montfort was to be freed.
However, Philip kept him at Paris till he escaped in disguise to England, <date value ="1345">1345</date>, whence he came back to Hennebon, where he died, leaving <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> guardian to his son. It was clear that these truces would hardly lead to anything: the Normans were again privateering in the Channel, and the French
            king trying to seize Guienne, so Parliament begged <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> to begin open war again or make a good peace at once.  <note place="foot" n="1">The campaigns of <dateRange from="1345" to="1347">1345-1347</dateRange>. Auberoche,

 for his son, July <date value ="1345">1345</date>. But his friend James of Artaveldt was murdered in a town riot at Ghent, and he returned empty-handed. News now came that John, the French king's son (who had been sent to the south with a great host after the easy victory of Derby at Auberoche, June <date value ="1345">1345</date>, over the Earl of Lisle), was pressing the English hard in Guienne.
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> therefore sailed to his aid, but stopping on the way, by the counsel of Sir Geoffrey of Harcourt, a Norman outlaw, landed at La Hogue, intending to strike at the now defenceless north of France. Taking C&#x00E6;n and other cities on his way, from which he sent much spoil and many prisoners to England, he marched east to join the Flemings, who had already broken into Picardy. But Philip had destroyed all the bridges on the lower Seine, and <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> had to turn up the south bank in hopes of finding a crossing, the French king, with an army which grew bigger every day as <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s dwindled with sickness and losses, following him on the other bank. At last by a feigned attack on Paris, <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> gained a few hours to repair the broken bridge at Poissy, crossed it safely, and made north again to the Somme, with Philip close at his heels. After seeking some time for a ford, he luckily found one at Blanketake, hard by Abbeville, and got his army across in the teeth of a French force before Philip could come up. He now halted in a strong position at Crecy and rested his weary men. Next day Philip's army came up from
Abbeville, marching through a terrible thunderstorm, and preceded by a cloud of birds frightened by the weather or by an eclipse which took place that morning. The men were so tired and wet that the leaders begged Philip to halt and get his army into good order that day, and attack on the morrow. But when he saw the English all drawn up in order on the hillside, under the banner of his rival, " he hated them, and bade the Genoese crossbowmen begin the attack."
Their strings were slack with the rain, and they told the
Constable of France that they were not fit to fight that day.
But he called them cowards and told them to fall on. The sun shone out in the Frenchmen's faces as the battle began at five o'clock. <quote>" When they drew near, the Genoese made a great leap and cry to abash the English, but they stood still and stirred not for all that. And a second time they made another leap and a dreadful cry, and stept forward a little, and the Englishmen removed not one foot. Again they leapt and cried, and went forward till they came within shot, then they shot fiercely with their crossbows. Then the English archers stept forward one pace and let fly their arrows so hotly

 and so thick that it seemed snow. When the Genoese felt the arrows piercing through heads, arms, and breasts, many of them cast down their crossbows and cut their strings, and ran back discomfited. When the French king saw them flying, he said, <q type="spoken">'Slay those rascals, for they will hinder us and block up our path for nothing.' </q>Then you should have seen the men-at-arms dash in among them and kill a great number thereof, and still the Englishmen kept shooting wherever they saw the thickest press; and the sharp arrows ran into the men-at-arms and into their horses, and many fell among the Genoese, and when they were down they could not get up again, for the press was so thick that one overthrew the other. Also among the English soldiers were certain

Cornishmen and Welsh that went afoot with great knives, and they went in among the French and slew and murdered many as they lay on the ground, earls, barons, knights, and squires, whereat the King of England was afterward displeased, for he had rather they had been taken for their ransoms."</quote> Into this struggling mass the French knights

<q type="spoken">"No, sir, but hardly matched."</q> <q type="spoken">"Then go back to them that sent you, and tell them to send to me no more whatever betide as long as my son is alive, and bid them let him win his spurs, for, please God, I wish this day and the honour thereof to be his, and those that are with him."</q> And they that heard it were mightily encouraged by the king's words.
Our men fought on steadily in good order, and the French, who were broken up into small parties, were completely defeated by sunset, having lost nearly all their commanders.
The King of Bohemia, who wished to strike a blow at the
English, and was led into the fight between two of his knights, for he was dim of sight, was killed in the forefront of the battle. There fell also the King of Majorca, the Duke of
Lorraine, and the Constable, with 1200 knights and more than
20,000 commoners. Philip was wounded in the throat and thigh, and had a horse killed under him, but he would not turn away till the battle was clearly lost. The English lit fires where they stood, and waited for the day gladly enough.
And the king came down to the field and said to his son,
<q type="spoken">"Sweet son, God grant you to go on as you have begun. You have quitted yourself well to-day, you are worthy to be a king."</q> But the Prince bowed and gave all the honour to his father. On the next morning the English defeated a fresh body of troops who stumbled upon them in the fog, and when the mist cleared they were able to cut off the French stragglers who had lurked about the woods and fields, so that there fell more that day than on the Saturday. <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s way was now clear, and he resolved to lay siege to Calais; for all was going on well in the south, now that John of
Normandy had been forced to withdraw from the siege of
Aiguillon and hasten to the help of his father.</p>
  <p>While <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> lay in front of Calais the English had two more successes. <persName key="David II.">David</persName>, King of Scotland, who had come back from France, was led by <persName key="Philip IV.">Philip</persName>'s letters to invade
England. The knights and yeomen of the northern counties mustered under the Archbishop of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and the Border

John of Copeland, and the invaders fled in haste.   The captive prince was sent to the Tower amid great rejoicing.
Soon after this, June 20, <date value ="1347">1347</date>, Charles of Blois was taken prisoner by Sir Thomas Dagworth at la Roche d'Errein and lodged in the same stronghold. Meanwhile all the French attempts to victual or relieve Calais were vain, and the governor, John of Vienne, at last wrote to Philip:-
  <quote>The town suffereth great lack of corn and wine and meat, for know that there is nought but what hath been eaten, both dogs, cats, and horses, so that we cannot find anything else in the town to eat save we eat the flesh of men. Ye wrote us aforetime that I should hold the town as long as there was aught to eat, but now we are at the point of having no more to eat. Wherefore, my right dear and redoubted lord, provide such remedy as shall seem fittest to you; for if remedy and counsel be not shortly provided, ye will have no more letters from me, and the town will be lost and all we that are therein.</quote>
Philip led a great army to relieve it at Whitsuntide <date value ="1347">1347</date>, but he dared not attack <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>, and as <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> would not leave his quarters to fight in the open, he retreated, leaving the town to its fate. John of Vienne thereupon yielded at <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s mercy. The English king treated his prisoners well, and suffered all those burgesses who would swear fealty to him to stay in the town, the others he replaced by Englishmen. He further gave the city great privileges as a market-town, and it rapidly grew and flourished under his rule. It was probably in remembrance of its capture that <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> made the
Order of the Garter, a brotherhood of twenty-five knights.
Calais was of the highest value to the English kings so long as the Hundred Years' War lasted, for it was one of the gates of the Channel and an open doorway into
France. 'The French felt the loss heavily, and as early as December 31, <date value ="1348">1348</date>, tried to regain it in time of peace by bribing <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s governor; but he was angry at seeing his honour doubted, and lured his tempters into the castle, when after a short but deadly struggle, in which King
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> himself took part, they were all taken or slain.
As soon as Calais had surrendered, Pope Clement, who had done all he could to make peace, was able to get Philip and
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> to agree to a truce, 28th September, which save in
Brittany held till <date value ="1355">1355</date>, the only exploit performed in the interval being the sea-fight off Winchelsea, August 29, <date value ="1350">1350</date>.
A fleet of privateers from  Biscay under the Earl of la
Cerda had on their way to Flanders plundered English ships and murdered their crews. <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> put out in search of them, and came upon them as they were sailing back from

 the Scheldt laden with cloth and bullion.  The English vessels were small, and the Spaniards from their high decks were able to sink the king's and the Prince's ship with blows of beams and stones; but the English boarded their enemies and took twenty-four of them after a fierce fight. After this the Biscay towns were glad to make a twenty years' peace with <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>, and the Channel was again open to English merchants.</p>
  <p>7. <note place="foot" n="6">The Black Death, <date value ="1349">1349</date>.</note>A more terrible ill than war itself suddenly fell upon
Western Europe in <date value ="1348">1348</date>-the Black Death, by whose attacks (repeated in <date value ="1361">1361</date>, <date value ="1369">1369</date>, <date value ="1407">1407</date>) at least half the population of England and France were swept away. Its first and worst visit lasted from August 1, <date value ="1348">1348</date>, to
Mich&#x00E6;lmas <date value ="1349">1349</date>, and while it raged in London 200 bodies a day were laid in Smithfields New Graveyard, besides all those buried in the parish churchyards. These plagues brought about much change in England. For, owing to the great lack of labour, wages and prices rose rapidly, in spite of the
Statute of Labourers and other decrees to fix maximum prices of food, and to allow the justices of the peace to settle the wages of day-labourers and craftsmen.  Serfs ran away from their lords and hired themselves out as free workmen, labourers got what wages they chose at haymaking and harvest-tide, farms were left untilled, as the lords found it would not pay them to keep so much land under the plough, since the cost of tillage had doubled. They therefore in many cases freed and turned off their serfs, let out their farms at fixed money rates (as the bishops and monks had long been used to do), and took to sheep-farming and cattle-raising, which needed many less hands than tillage, and turned large spaces of land to good account in the cheapest way, for England was now wool-grower for all Western
Europe. In a word, the rise of the serfs into free labourers, the replacing of customary tenants bound to labour by tenant-farmers paying money-rent, and the increase of the large estates needed for sheep-walks and grazing-meads are largely due to the Black Death. It also permanently lowered the value of gold and silver. The relative strength of the nations of Europe was little changed by it, as it treated all alike, but it had a great effect upon men's thoughts and ways for two generations.</p>
  <p>8. Parliament was not idle during the truce. The growing discontent of the English king and people with the conduct of the popes was marked by the Statute of Provisors,

Nor were other matters overlooked: in <date value ="1352">1352</date> the Statute of Treason was passed declaring exactly what that offence was; in <date value ="1353">1353</date> the Ordinance of the Staple provided that wool, woolfells, leather, lead, and tin should only be sold at certain staple ports-London, <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName>, <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, Chichester, <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>,

Cork, Drogheda, Waterford, Middleburgh (in Zealand), and
Calais-and by merchants enrolled in the Company of the
Staple [selling scaffold]. In this way it was easy to regulate trade and to collect taxes on exports. In <date value ="1357">1357</date> the Ordinance of Ireland was made, in which the king promises the people of the Pale the same rights and laws as the English, forbids government save by Parliament, orders yearly inquiry to be made into the behaviour of the sheriffs and royal officers, and commands the Deputy and other governors to tell the king the truth as to the state of things in Ireland.</p>
  <p>King <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> had a large family, and he provided for them by marrying them to his rich wards, and by appointing them as rulers over parts of his dominions. Thus he made <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> of Woodstock, his eldest son, Duke of Aquitaine, and married him to his cousin the heiress of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>. His second son, Lionel of Antwerp, he married to the heiress of Ulster, named Duke of Clarence, and sent as Deputy to Ireland, where he passed the Statute of Kilkenny <date value ="1366">1366</date>, in which he tried to stop the English of the Pale from mixing with or living like the wild Irish.  For the English lords turned out their own tenants and replaced them by Irishmen, whom they had more power over, and who were more faithful to their interests, so that the Pale was falling back into lawlessness and private war. Lionel was also to have been King of Scotland if <persName key="David II.">David</persName> could have got his nobles to take him as his heir, and he might have striven for the crown at <persName key="David II.">David</persName>'s death if he had not died in Italy in <date value ="1368">1368</date>. <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> was first married to the heiress of Lancaster, the <soCalled>"good Duchess Blanche,"</soCalled> and from a second marriage (as will be seen) drew claims upon the crown of Castile. Of John's younger brothers, Edmund of Langley was espoused to the heiress of Flanders, and
Thomas of Woodstock married to one of the heiresses of

 the Earl of Hereford. Thus <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> had got together in his own family all the older earldoms of England. He also bestowed greater dignity upon his kinsfolk than any king before him, by giving dukedoms to Henry, Earl of Lancaster, <date value ="1351">1351</date>, and to his sons, <persName key="Edward, the Black Prince">Edward</persName> (Duke of Cornwall,
<date value ="1337">1337</date>) and Lionel (Duke of Clarence, <date value ="1362">1362</date>). His daughters he married to those whom he thought would be of service to him-Isabel to Ingelram of Coucy, created Earl of Bedford
<date value ="1354">1354</date>, Mary to John V. of Brittany, while Joan was betrothed to Peter of Castile, and Margaret to John Hastings, Earl of
Pembroke.</p>
  <p>9. <note place="foot" n="8"> The campaigns of <date value ="1355">1355</date>, <date value ="1356">1356</date>. Poitiers.</note>The
French war broke out again in <date value ="1355">1355</date> in spite of all
Pope Innocent XI. could do, as the new king John II. refused to make peace. <persName key="Edward, the Black Prince">The Black Prince</persName> began by leading a Seven Weeks' Raid into South France as far as Carcassonne, threatening the Pope at Avignon, and coming back to
Bordeaux unhindered with the plunder of 500 harried towns and villages. His father started on a similar foray from
Calais, but was called home to fight the Scots, who took Berwick, but were repaid in kind by an invasion long talked of as the Burnt Candlemas, in which wellnigh every town in the Lowlands was fired. King <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> then got his friend Edward <persName key="Balliol, Edward">Balliol</persName> to give him his rights to the crown of Scotland, which might be useful to him in the future, and turned homeward to hear the good news of his son's victory at Poitiers.
<persName key="Edward, the Black Prince">The Black Prince</persName> had repeated his raid in <date value ="1356">1356</date>, but towards the northeast. This time the French were ready, and when he turned back he found himself cut off from the sea by King John at the head of an army five times the size of his own. He would fain have made peace now, but John was so sure of his prey that he refused him fair terms. <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> therefore prepared to sell his life as dearly as possible. He drew up his little company at the top of a cleft in the hills near
Poitiers known as Maupertuis [the Ill-Chine], lined the vine-clad hedges along the sides of the lane that ran up the
Chine with archers, and placed an ambush well in front of his right wing on a detached height. At nine o'clock the
French made a headlong onslaught, but their first column was mown down in the steep lane by the English archers, while a flank attack broke their second line, and the Prince charging upon their main body completed their discomfiture.
By noon the French were in full flight, most of their leaders slain, and King John himself, who had struggled bravely on foot to the last, a captive in the Prince's hands.  So

 many prisoners were taken that the English preferred to let them go at once on parole rather than risk guarding them with their small numbers. The Prince's army had fought

 with the courage of despair, for few of the footmen had tasted food for three days. King John was taken to England and
France was left at the mercy of her foes. The Estates of the realm met and appointed a council to govern under the
Regent, John's eldest son, till the king could be ransomed.
But the Regent was at odds with the Estates; his cousin
Charles, King of Navarre, the favourite of the Commons of
Paris, was trying to win the crown for himself; and the peasants, disgusted at the quarrels and cowardice of their worthless rulers, who dared to grind them down and murder each other, but were not able to defend their country, rose in the midst of France and massacred all the gentlefolk they could lay hands on, till the English Gascon and German knights went to help the French nobles and put down the
Jacquerie, as it was called, from Jacques Bonhomme [James
Goodman], the nickname of the French serf. The English meanwhile beset Rheims and Paris, <date value ="1359">1359</date> and <date value ="1360">1360</date>, to force the Regent to submit to their terms. At last, in <date value ="1360">1360</date>, at
Bretigny a final peace was signed, by which John was to be



<pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

 ransomed at 3,000,00000 gold crowns and to give up all rights upon Calais and Guienne, while the English king was to let drop his claims on the crown of France.</p>

  <p>10. So the main war ended, but there was no perfect peace in <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s days.  After Bretigny the Free Companies, bands of hired soldiers who had served the French and
English kings in the last campaigns, became a terror to
France, till they were got rid of in divers ways. Ingelram of
Coucy brought one band of them, the Guglers, through Burgundy into Switzerland, where they were beaten by the men of Bern. Sir John Hawkwood took the White Company into
Italy and served the city of Florence with them till his death.

Edmund of Langley, and got <persName key="Edward, the Black Prince">the Black Prince</persName> to bring an army to aid him to win back his throne. In the decisive battle of 3rd April <date value ="1367">1367</date>, when the river Najara ran red for a mile, the English overthrew Henry and took Bertrand prisoner; but Peter would not fulfil his promises of pay, and fever-stricken and disappointed, the Prince came back to
Bordeaux. Peter, left to himself, was soon taken and slain by his brother Henry, and <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> forthwith claimed the crown of Castile, in pursuit of which he was engaged ever and anon till <date value ="1388">1388</date>. The end of <persName key="Edward, the Black Prince">the Black Prince</persName>'s career abroad was not happy; his harshness to the Gascons caused their appeal to John's son King Charles V. in <date value ="1369">1369</date>, and led to breach of the treaty of Bretigny and French invasions in
<date value ="1370">1370</date>. This was repelled, and Limoges, which had gladly received the invaders, was retaken by the Prince himself, who ordered a massacre of the townsfolk as traitors, and saw it carried out. But the Spaniards balanced his successful defence of Gascony by the defeat and capture of the Earl of Pembroke off the port of Rochelle, which he was about to relieve from a French attack, June 23, <date value ="1372">1372</date>; and Bertrand du Glesquin
(who had been ransomed by the Pope) drove John of
Montfort the younger from the duchy he had held ever since
Charles of Blois was slain at Auray in <date value ="1364">1364</date>. In <date value ="1373">1373</date>, being broken in health and unfit for war, Prince <persName key="Edward, the Black Prince">Edward</persName> gave up his duchy of Aquitaine and came home, <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> taking his place for a while as Captain-General. But though the French let the young Duke of Lancaster march through
France from Calais to Bordeaux without giving him battle, they managed bit by bit to win castle after castle and town after town on the Gascon marches, and to drive Montfort out of Brittany a second time in <date value ="1375">1375</date>. The English were fast finding out that it was easier to win battles than to hold what they already had, and that the expense of keeping up garrisons and feeding armies soon ate up all the profits of the most successful raids and the largest ransoms.</p>
  <p>11. Struggles against misrule in Church and State fill the last years of <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s reign. The growing feeling of laymen with regard to the former has been noticed, but there were not lacking churchmen who saw the evils in their midst. Richard, Archbishop of Armagh, had spent his life in preaching against the sins into which the orders of the friars had fallen. Ockham and others had taken their stand against the greed and abuses of the Pope and his court, and

<soCalled>"The gospel doctor,"</soCalled><persName key="Wyclif, John"> John Wyclif</persName>f, was now to take up these men's work and carry it into a wider field; for he was not content with teaching in the <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> schools or preaching at the Church of S. Mary's, but continually appealed to the Government and to Parliament, and laid the points at issue before laymen in their own tongue by his pamphlets and his new order of<soCalled> " wayfaring preachers."</soCalled>
Born about <date value ="1320">1320</date>, he won fame at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> by his good life, fine lectures, and bold philosophical views. He was Fellow of Balliol College about <date value ="1345">1345</date>, Master of Balliol <date value ="1361">1361</date>, Warden of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> Hall <date value ="1365">1365</date>, and Doctor of Theology about <date value ="1370">1370</date>.
His ability and learning led to his being named one of the commissioners who were sent to Bruges in <date value ="1374">1374</date> to try and make a Concordat [agreement] with the Pope as to his rights over the English Church. On his return he began to write against the abuses of the Church, laying great stress upon the need of a holy life in all priests and bishops, setting forth his idea of what a true Church should be, and calling upon laymen to put the Church in order since it was clearly turning aside from its duties in the pursuit of wealth and honours.
The friars were pleased with his praise of the poverty of the early Church, and <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>, who had known him at
Bruges, wished to use him against William of Wyckham and the other bishops who were withstanding his plans of government. So when in February <date value ="1377">1377</date> <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName> was called before
Convocation for his teaching, the Duke of Lancaster and the Earl Marshal spoke so threateningly to the Bishop of
London that the enraged Londoners rose in riot, sacked the
Savoy Palace, sought to slay the duke, and caused such confusion that the matter was obliged to be dropped, though the city was punished by having its rights taken away for a time. However the bishops got Bulls from <persName key="Gregory XI.">Pope Gregory XI.</persName> to examine <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>; but they were not put into force till February <date value ="1378">1378</date>, after King <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName>'s death, when he appeared in London and explained away the accusations against him. As the Princess of Wales forbade the Court to judge him, and the Londoners, with whom he was at this time very popular, broke into the room and took his part with warmth, he again escaped his foes.</p>
  <p>12. In his latter days King <persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> gave less and less heed to the ruling of the kingdom, especially after the death of his good queen Philippa in <date value ="1369">1369</date>, and left matters much in the hands of his favourites, chief of whom were the Earl of

Pembroke and <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>, who were careful to trouble him as little as possible; for he shrunk from the task of helping his ministers, William of
Wyckham the Chancellor and Brantingham the
Treasurer (Bishops of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName> and Exeter), in their thankless toil of getting money to carry on a war which was growing more costly and less glorious every day.  He simply let matters take their course.  In <date value ="1360">1360</date> he had agreed to a law fixing the number and duties of the justices of the peace, who were now taking the place and doing the work of the old hundred courts touching all offences against the king's peace.  In <date value ="1362">1362</date>, willing to please his people, he ordered that English, not French, should be used in the courts of law, and that all records should be kept in
Latin, and promised that he would lay on no tax whatever without the consent of Parliament; for hitherto he, like his father, had often got the merchants to agree to taxes on their goods so as to avoid being obliged to ask money of the
Three Estates, whom they could not cajole so easily. In <date value ="1371">1371</date> the Earl of Pembroke got the Parliament to beg of the king to dismiss his clerical ministers and take laymen in their stead, and he did so; and in <date value ="1372">1372</date> an Act was passed forbidding lawyers or sheriffs to sit in Parliament. But the government by <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> and his friends was growing unpopular-they spent as much and did no more than their foregoers-and in <date value ="1376">1376</date> the former ministers, headed by the princes of Wales and William of Wyckham, regained power in the Good Parliament. Peter de la Mare, a follower of
<persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>'s rival, the Earl of March, was chosen Speaker, and he headed the Commons in impeaching [accusing before the Lords] Richard Lyon and Barons Latimer and Neville for embezzling the government moneys, for buying the king's debts at low prices, and getting full and instant payment to the hurt of the king's credit, for lending the king money at thirty-three per cent. interest, and for making a profit out of the customs. They were all found guilty, sent to prison, and fined. The Commons then prayed the king to issue a decree against women meddling in the law courts, by which means they were able to have Alice Perrers, his favourite, banished from court, for she had abused her power overthe king to cause the judges to give unjust sentences on behalf of those who bribed her to speak for them. In the midst of this Parliament <persName key="Edward, the Black Prince">the Black Prince</persName> died, June 8, <date value ="1376">1376</date>, to the great grief of his party, whereon the Commons, fearing lest <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> should try to seize the crown when the old king died, got


<pb id="p.241" n="241"/>


<persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> to name <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, the Prince's little son, his heir, and to add nine lords named by them to his Standing Council.
But directly the Parliament broke up <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> overthrew all it had done, turned the Earl of March out of tie
Marshalcy, had William of Wyckham tried and banished for misuse of public moneys, imprisoned Peter de la Mare without trial, recalled Alice Perrers and the impeached lords.
Moreover, he managed to get the greater number of the
Commons in the Parliament of <date value ="1377">1377</date> chosen from among his friends, and so ensured their approval of his acts. He was able to do this because, besides those who feared or loved him, there were still many, such as <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName> and the friars, who upheld him as the enemy of the bishops.</p>
  <p>13.  <note place="foot" n="11"><persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>'s character and death.</note>On
June 2, <date value ="1377">1377</date>, the old king died. Alice Perrers was with him all through his illness, for she was afraid of any one else winning influence over him. But when she saw that he was at the point of death, she pulled the rings off his cold hands and fled, while the servants were busy plundering the palace; and had it not been for a priest who came in and stayed with him till the last, the helpless sufferer would have been left to die unheeded and alone.</p>
  <p><persName key="Edward III.">Edward</persName> was a man of a wonderfully fair face and noble bearing, as his effigies witness to this day; of exceeding grace of manner and much good-nature, as his name of the "kindly king" testifies. He did not lack book-learning, and could speak five languages. That he was a brave knight and a prudent commander even his enemies allowed. He was singularly even-tempered, not easily cast down by trouble or roused to anger by opposition or puffed up by success. But, on the other hand, he was selfish, and so preferred to be generous to his enemies rather than pay his debts to his friends, would rather be popular at other men's cost than take the blame of his own mistakes, and was ready to sacrifice his faithful servants if he could save himself the trouble of taking an active and toilsome part in the work of keeping down his expenses. His passion for pleasure stained his latter days, and his thirst for fame led to much useless and wicked bloodshed both in England and France, and brought no small disasters upon those of his race whom his great deeds dazzled and example misled.</p>

<p>1. After a grand coronation, July 16, the new reign began with a reconciliation of the two parties. William of Wickham and <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> were set at one, the two parties of the Londoners under <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>'s helper, John of Northampton, and John Philpot, the bishops' partisan, made friends. Peter de la Mare was let out of prison. The
Bishops of S. David and Worcester were made chancellor and treasurer, a council was chosen to carry on the government with them, and the king, a lad of eleven years old, was left to the care of his mother. When Parliament met it added nine members to the Council, and laid down <hi rend="italics">that
Acts passed in Parliament should not be set aside save by
Parliament, and that while the king was under age Parliament should choose his ministers.</hi> But <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> was still the chief man in the realm ; and though he had disclaimed in full Parliament all enmity to his brother's son, and his wishes for the good of the realm, he was disliked and mistrusted by many. The French and Scots had got fleets of privateers in the Channel, and the east coast, the
Isle of <placeName key="Wight">Wight</placeName>, Rye, and Winchelsea suffered from their raids, and later on they harried Portsmouth and the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> mouth, burning Gravesend, <date value ="1380">1380</date>. The expedition of Duke
John and his brother Edmund to S. Malo in <date value ="1378">1378</date> was of small profit, for though Charles, King of Navarre, gave up his fortresses in Normandy, amongst others Cherbourg, to get English help against the King of Castile, the French won them nearly all. Even Montfort's recall to Brittany in
<date value ="1379">1379</date> availed little, for the Bretons only wished to play off the one kingdom against the other, and so to keep their freedom.<note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>'s unlucky government, <dateRange from="1377" to="1381">1377-1381</dateRange>. </note>
Thus when the Earl of Buckingham marched from
Calais to Vannes to their help, they would scarcely give his host food or shelter, and in
<date value ="1380">138O</date> forced their duke to send them  away and make peace with the new King of France,
<persName key="Charles VI.">Charles VI.</persName> Lancaster's blundering and mismanagement was made the more clear by the successes of others. For
Sir Hugh Calverley with his one galley saved our transports at Brest from the French and Spanish fleet; while John
Philpot fitted out a few craft of his own, and took the
Scottish sea-rover John the Mercer, <date value ="1380">1380</date>, <quote>"spending his

 money and jeoparding his life for the sake of the poor people and realm of England, and not at all to rob knights of the garland of glory"</quote> (as he told the nobles who grudged him his victory); and John Bassett won back Berwick from the Scots by his ready action. Moreover, the wanton and reckless behaviour of the duke's followers, who slew a knight in lawful sanctuary in Westminster Abbey itself, made the Londoners and bishops hate him more than ever. So that the duke would not hold Parliament in London, but got it to sit at
Northampton, where by <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>'s help he tried to get the right of sanctuary done away with, save when the refugee's life or limbs were in danger. But the Houses were taken up with the ways of meeting the sums needed for the defence of the realm. A fresh toll or subsidy was set upon wool, and a poll-tax laid upon every grown-up person in the kingdom according to his means, from the labourer or workwoman's
4d. up to the duke and archbishop's &#x00A3;6, 13s. 4d. But the wool-tax only brought in &#x00A3;6000, and the poll-tax &#x00A3;22,000, so that at Northampton next year the ministers reported that they should want  &#x00A3;1600,000. Astonished at this huge sum, and forgetting that the buying-power of money was less than it had been, the Parliament angrily turned out the ministry, audited the accounts, and refused to raise more than  &#x00A3; 100,000, of which the clergy, owning a third of the land, were to pay a third, the rest was to be got by a treble poll-tax, one of the results of which was the Peasants' Rising of <date value ="1381">1381</date>, long remembered with horror as Hurling-time.</p>
<p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The causes of the Peasants' Rising.</note>Many causes met at this time to make the English poor unhappy and troubled. a. In the country the serfs, seeing the welfare of their free fellows, were longing to be free themselves: the free labourers were angry with the laws that tried to beat down wages ; the customary tenants disliked having to give up so much of their time without pay to the lords, and grumbled at the dues of the manor: the free tenants and yeomen suffered from the heavy market-tolls, the occasional purveyance, and the continual taxes, which as far as they could see were wasted by the Government. b. In many parts of the country the forest laws were very hateful, and led to much angry feeling, outlaws and poachers, such as the songs of Robin Hood tell of, being the heroes of the country-side.
In the towns the labourers suffered from the selfish guild laws, which raised the cost of food. c. The craftsmen in the guilds were struggling hard to wrest the control of the towns from the rich burgess families, who managed matters for



<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>
   <note type="header"  place="head"><date value="1381">[1381.</date></note>
 their own benefit; while both classes hated the foreigners, whose quickness and skill enabled them to undersell and outbid them in many ways, and the speculators, <quote>" forestallers, regraters, and engrossers,"</quote> who forced up the price of food, and hoarded the money that was wanted for daily trade.
The enmity between the friars and the endowed clergy raged as fiercely as ever, and the poor chaplains, who since the plague had been left by the rich rectors and vicars in charge of many of the country parishes, were indignant at the remissness and greed of their richer brethren. Nor were these feelings only shown in words. In the home counties the labourers formed clubs to resist the laws fixing wages; the freed bondsmen appealed to the courts against the lords, who were trying in many cases to get them back into bondage; the customary tenants resisted the encroachments of the manor-stewards. They were encouraged by the old soldiers, who came back from the wars boasting that the yeoman's arrow was more than a match for the knight's spear, and telling how the fullers and webbers of Ghent and Bruges under James of Artaveld and John Lyon had won their freedom by standing together shoulder to shoulder against their cruel lord the

They were flattered by the friars' praise of poverty and mockery of the rich; they were emboldened by <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>'s poor priests, who preached the doctrine that property and power were only lawfully held by those who were pious and godly, and that a bad rich man had no right to his lands or goods. But the man who more than any one else tried to get the poor to stand up for themselves and demand reforms was John Ball, the priest of S. Mary's, <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, who began travelling through <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> and
Essex, holding forth to the people on their wrongs and the best ways of mending them. He often used in his sermons and letters the words of <persName key="Langland, William">William Langland</persName>, a poor clerk of
London, who had written a set of English poems called
<hi rend="italics">Dreams about Piers the Plowman</hi>, allegories in which he boldly showed up the vices of the day, talking of Lady
Bribery and her power at court, of Lord Lust and Master
Simony, and their influence with the clergy and gentry; exhorting men to be patient, reasonable, kindly, and to follow the example of Piers the Plowman, the honest, hardworking, dutiful man who will not be turned from his right work by hardship or temptation; calling men to come and defend
Conscience, who is closely besieged by the Seven Deadly
Sins; and praying them to walk in the steps of Do-well, Dobetter, and Do-best, the types of holiness, uprightness, and

 welldoing. The characters of these poems soon became as well known among the peasants by the preaching of Ball and his friend Wraw as those of John Bunyan's <hi rend="italics">Pilgrim's.
Progress</hi> are to us. John Ball spoke with power, his pithy sayings could not be forgotten. In one of his sermons he makes his text of the famous couplet-
               <quote rend="blockquote"><l>When Adam dalf [dug] and Eve span,</l>
               <l>Who was then the gentleman?"</l></quote>

He said that all men were equal and all things common in the beginning, that England would never be at rest till slavery was done away with and things more fairly shared, so that those who did the work should have a better part of the profit thereof.  He called on his hearers to rise in a body and go to the king and ask him to right their wrongs. One of his letters runs-
     <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"John the Miller asketh help to turn his Mill right:</l>

<l>       Look thy Mill go right, with its four sails dight,</l>
<l>       And let the post stand in steadfastness.</l>
<l>       Let right help might, and skill go before will,</l>
<l>                        Then shall our Mill go aright;</l>
<l>       But if might go before right, and will go before skill,</l>

In another he greets <quote>"John Nameless, and John the

They marched along the highways, making every one they met swear to be true to
King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> and the Commons, and never to take a king called John; they pulled down the houses of some of the worst landlords, and destroyed all the tax-rolls and manor-rolls they could get at, so that all proof of slavery might be destroyed; they also killed several lawyers and foreigners, and slew the Chief-Justice, the Prior of Bury, and some knights that resisted them. In the north great bands went about sacking the estates of the Duke of Lancaster, who was on the border making a truce with the Scots.
In the east they were resisted by Henry Despenser, Bishop of <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName>, who scattered them with great slaughter. But in the south the ministers were either too careless or too frightened to do anything till it was too late, and the peasants had beset London, the Essex men camping at Hampstead, the <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>ish men at Blackheath, and the Hertfordshire folk at Highbury. The king wished to hear what they wanted, but the archbishop would not have him <quote>"listen to such shoeless rascals ;"</quote> however, he went down the river in his barge to
Blackheath and saw their force, though he did not land or parley with them. William Walworth the mayor and the richer burgesses wished to keep the city gates shut, but the poor of London opened them and let the peasants in, July 12.
They kept good order, and allowed no plundering, saying that they were seekers after truth and righteousness and not robbers; but they fired <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>'s house the Savoy, the

 cut it up and pounded it to pieces with axes, but they let his son go free. Their demands were-(a) a free pardon, (b) the abolition of slavery, (c) the sweeping away of all tolls and market-dues, and (d) the turning of all customary tenants into leaseholders for ever at 4d. per acre. On the 14th of
July the king rode out to meet Jack Straw and the Essex men at Mile End, and promised to grant them their wishes, whereupon they went quietly home. But the <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>ish men broke into the Tower as the king left, for the knights and archers on guard were too frightened to resist, and getting hold of the archbishop, Simon, and the treasurer, Sir Robert Hales, beheaded them on Tower Hill as traitors. The king passed the night at the Wardrobe, a stronghold by Blackfriars, and next morning went with William Walworth the mayor and several knights to meet <persName key="Tiler, Wat">Wat Tiler</persName>, the captain of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, and head of the whole rising, at Smithfield. <persName key="Tiler, Wat">Tiler</persName> rode up and tried to get the king to promise to do away with the forest laws, and let all men be free to kill wild beasts and game. As they talked <persName key="Tiler, Wat">Walter</persName> began quarrelling with one of the king's squires, and so angered the mayor, Walworth, that he drew his short sword and dealt the <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>ish captain such a blow that he fell off his horse, whereupon the royal squires leapt down and stabbed him repeatedly as he lay helpless on the ground.
When the peasants saw their leader fall they shouted, <q type="spoken">" Let us stand together ! We will die with our captain or avenge him ! Shoot, lads, shoot !"</q> and bent their bows. But the young king rode alone towards them as quick as he could, and called to them, <q type="spoken">" What is this, my men ? Will you shoot your king? Never care for <persName key="Tiler, Wat">Walter</persName>'s fall. He was a traitor.
I will be your captain; come, follow me to the fields, where you shall have the charters you ask for."</q> And seeing the boldness of the boy they followed him quietly out of the city to Islington, while Walworth rode back into London to gather troops. Now that <persName key="Tiler, Wat">Walter</persName> was dead the rich citizens and knights grew bold, and gathered in numbers to the king's help, begging to be allowed to fall upon the leaderless peasants; but the king would not permit this, and sent them home with their charters in peace. The princess had been much frightened by the rising, for the <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>ish men had stopped her on the way from <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, and had broken into her rooms in the Tower to search for traitors, and she was right glad to see her son come home safe that evening. <q type="spoken">"Ah, my

 which I had lost."</q> The rising was indeed over. And now the punishment of the peasants began, for it was said that
Jack Straw had confessed that they had meant to take the king about with them, as their head, till all the gentry were slain, and then that they were going to put him and all the rich clergy to death, and set up a king of their own in every shire, letting the friars and poor priests serve the churches.
Whether this was true or not, the landlords determined to stop such risings by hanging every ringleader they could catch.
On the 2nd and 3rd of July the king recalled the charters as being got by unlawful force, forbade all public meetings, and sent Tresilian, the new chief-justice, round the shires to try the rebels. John Ball, Jack Straw, and Grindcob, and nearly all the village leaders, some hundreds in all, were taken, found guilty, and hanged in chains as a warning to others.</p>
  <p>The Parliament met in November, and the king said that though the charters had been unlawful, and he had therefore repealed them, since it was not in his power to deal with other men's property or bondsmen, yet that he would gladly agree to a law to set all bondsmen free: for he was sorry for the peasants who had trusted in his word. But the squires and clergy, the nobles and citizens, <quote>" answered with one voice that the repeal was well done, and that they never did and never would agree to the freeing of their serfs, which would be their downfall."</quote> However, in January <date value ="1382">1382</date>, on the marriage of the king to Ann, daughter of Charles, King of Bohemia, the Emperor, a general pardon was put forth to all who had joined in the rising. The movement had not turned out as the peasants hoped, but it taught the king's officers and the gentlefolks that they must treat the peasants like men if they wished them to behave quietly, and it led most landlords to set free their bondsmen, and to take fixed money payments instead of uncertain services from their customary tenants, so that in a hundred years' time there were very few bondsmen left in England.</p>
  <p>4. The Schism between the two popes-Urban VI. (whom the English, Flemings, Portuguese, and Germans followed) and Clement VII. (who was favoured by the French and
Castillians)-led to much discord in the Church, and made men look more narrowly into its beliefs and rights. About

<persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName> also, with the help of his friends
John Horn and Nicholas of Hereford, set about turning the
Bible from Latin into English, in favour of which <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> spoke up in Parliament against the bishops. <quote>" We will not be the refuse of all other nations, for since they have God's law, which is the law of our belief, in their own tongue, we will have ours in English whoever say nay,"</quote> and this he affirmed with a great oath. But <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>s old foe, William Courtenay, now succeeded Simon as archbishop, and he lost no time in attacking the Hooded men or Lollards [idlers], as the
<persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>ites were now called by the friars. At a council he held at Lambeth, May <date value ="1382">1382</date> (since known as the Earthquake
Council, from a great shock which did much damage in
England while it was sitting), many of <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>'s opinions were condemned as heretical or untrue. He also got the
Upper Houses to pass a bill against the Poor Preachers, but the Commons would not agree to it. Moreover, he sent to
<placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> to forbid all who held with <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName> to preach or teach there. And finally he brought up <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>, Hereford, John
Aston, and others to answer before him as to their belief.
<persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName> had a powerful friend in the Mayor of London, John
Comberton of Northampton (one of the Lancaster party, who in spite of the bishops had made stern rules against evil-livers in the city), and he was therefore allowed, after making a quibbling defence, to go home unhurt to Lutterworth, where he lived, writing and preaching as before, till he was struck with palsy at mass in his own church, 28th December <date value ="1384">1384</date>, and died on the 31st. Nicholas of Hereford appealed to the Pope and escaped to Rome, where he was imprisoned till <date value ="1385">1385</date>, when he came home and employed himself with his friend
John Purvey in revising <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>s Bible. Aston and many others gave up their former views in fear of the bishops.
But Lollardy was by no means put down, as will be seen, and the bishops and monks were still in fear because of its rapid spread.</p>
  <p>5. In the year <date value ="1382">1382</date> the French overcame the men of
Ghent at Rosbeck, slaying their leader Philip of Artaveld, and the English were afraid lest King Charles should win all
Flanders. So when the Bishop of <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName> got leave from
Urban to make a crusade against those who held with
Clement, he soon raised men and money enough to take an army into Flanders in May <date value ="1383">1383</date>, in spite of the wishes of
Lancaster, the angry outcry of <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>, and the reproaches of

Despenser took Gravelinles and won Dunkirk against heavy odds, but could not carry Ypres, and agreeing to a truce with the French, came home in
October; where he was much blamed in
Parliament, and deprived of the rents of his see for three years.  However, the men of
Ghent, owing to the fear of the English, had time to recover from their defeat, and were now strong enough to face their earl and his French friends, and hold their own under their new captain, Edward the Bursar. The king's uncle, the Earl of Cambridge, also came home from
Portugal, whither he had gone in <date value ="1381">1381</date>, on the invitation of
Ferdinand, King of Portugal, to help him against John,
King of Castile, the son of Henry of Trastamar. The Duke of Lancaster was to have followed him to Portugal, but had been kept at home because the money he would have had was spent over Despenser. Earl Edmund could not get
Ferdinand to risk a battle with the Spaniards, so when he had betrothed his eldest son Edward to Ferdinand's daughter
Beatrice, he came home, having spent 100,000 francs on this fruitless journey.  Ferdinand now made peace with John, to whom, breaking off the English match he married his daughter Beatrice.</p>
   <p>6. In spite of peace abroad, there was little at home. The
English nobles were split into parties : many held with
Lancaster; others were taking for their leader Thomas, Earl of Buckingham; while those most infavour with the Princess of
Wales and the young king were his half-brothers the Earls of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> and Huntingdon, and Sir Robert of Vere, Sir Simon
Burley, and Tresilian. In <date value ="1384">1384</date> the Duke of Lancaster was accused of treason, but his son-in-law, Sir John Holland, murdered the accuser, to the anger of the Earl of Buckingham: moreover, the duke's friend Comberton was imprisoned for opposing Sir Nicholas Brember, one of the king's party, who had been made mayor against the wish of many of the
Londoners.  The duke, fearing for his life, shut himself up in Pomfret Castle and prepared for war, but the king's mother managed to reconcile him with the king.   And

 this was the easier, for the truce was over and the French were beginning to gather a great navy for the invasion of England, and had sent Sir John of Vienne on beforehand in <date value ="1385">1385</date> with a fleetful of soldiers to help the Scottish King

French fleet was kept at Sluys by foul winds till it was too late to start for England, and next year, though King <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles</persName> lay waiting all the autumn with 2000 ships and 100,000 men, when the wind did come it blew a gale and wrecked a great part of his fleet; so that the danger was again turned away, much to the delight of the Londoners, who had cleared the walls of all the houses built near them, mounted guns along them, and been at much cost to put themselves in good array. The third year, <date value ="1387">1387</date>, when the French fleet was ready to sail from Treguier, the Duke of Brittany took the
French Constable, Oliver of Clisson, prisoner because he had ransomed John of Blois and married him to his own daughter.
So having lost their leader, the captains went home and the whole enterprise was at an end. It was well that the French were not able to land during these three years, for things were not going well in England, and a great part of the best knights were abroad with <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>; for in <date value ="1385">1385</date> there had come two gentlemen from King John of Portugal, the late King Ferdinand's half-brother, to the Duke of Lancaster, to tell him that he had won a great victory over King John of Castile at Aljjubarota, August 14, and that if the duke would now bring an army to Portugal, he would be able to set him on the throne of Castile. The duke knowing that he had lost favour with both king and people in England, and seeing that he had no chance of the throne (for <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> had lately made Roger, Earl of March, his heir), was glad to go abroad and try to win a crown there. <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> too was not unwilling to let him go, and the Pope gave him a tithe of the Church and blessed his enterprise as a crusade, just as he had done for Despenser, for the Castillian King John was a Clementist.

Now while he was away there had been a terrible struggle between the king's friends and the Earl of

In a Parliament at Westminster in October <date value ="1386">1386</date> the dismissal of the chancellor, Mich&#x00E6;l de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, was demanded.
But <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> bade the Parliament mind its own business, and said that he would not send away a scullion from his kitchen unless he chose.   Then Gloucester and Arundel threatened to depose him if he did not govern as the Parliament wished, and he gave way, sent the seals to the Bishop of Ely, allowed Suffolk to be impeached and condemned for misuse of public moneys, and agreed to, saving his royal rights, the appointment of a Board of Eleven to act with the ministers, and sit for a year to overlook the royal household and treasury, and amend all wrongs not provided for by the common, Church, or forest laws. But as soon as Parliament

 was dismissed, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> set Suffolk free, and rode through the country with his friends to try and gain help in the next
Parliament. He got the opinion of the judges that the new
Board was unlawful, that the king also has a right to choose and dismiss his ministers, and that those who threatened him and set up the Board had acted as traitors. This sentence he published, ordered Robert de Vere, whom he had made Duke of Ireland, to raise troops in the west, and sent to seize Arundel, who was just then highly in favour with the Londoners for his action of March 24, when he had taken the French wine-fleet, with 19,000 tuns of claret on board, and <quote>"made wine to sell at 4d. a gallon."</quote> Arundel escaped the royal officers, and taking up arms with Gloucester, Warwick, Nottingham, and Henry the young Earl of Derby, <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>'s eldest son, marched to London, seized the Tower, and appealed five of the king's counsellors, Dublin, Suffolk, Alexander Neville, Archbishop of
<placeName key="York">York</placeName>, Brember and Tresilian, of treason. Suffolk and the archbishop fled over-sea, Tresilian hid in disguise, Brember was taken. The Duke of Ireland was defeated at Radcot
Bridge, December 20, <date value ="1388">1388</date>, by the Earl of Derby's men, and took refuge in Lowen. As soon as the Parliament met,
February <date value ="1388">1388</date>, Gloucester first declared that he had never had any wish to make himself king, as his enemies had wished to make out, and then with his fellow-appellants charged the five counsellors with having advised the king ill, misused his money, tried to make Robert of Vere King of
Ireland, to raise civil war, and to bring a French army into
England. Ireland, Suffolk, Tresilian and Brember were condemned to death, and the two latter hanged. Neville was sent by the Pope to S. Andrews, where he would not be received, and <placeName key="Ely">Ely</placeName> put in his room at <placeName key="York">York</placeName>. The judges who had given their opinion against the earls were condemned to death, but allowed to live in exile in Ireland. Five more of the king's friends were then impeached and found guilty of treason, amongst whom was Sir Simon Burley. In vain
Henry of Derby spoke for him, in vain the king wished him to be spared, in vain the queen pleaded on her knees to
Gloucester and Arundel for the life of this old knight who had brought about her marriage to the king, and had served

For no man there one foot would flee, but stiffly each did stand,
One hewing the other while he could smite, with many a baleful brand.
The Gordons good in English blood they steeped their hose and shoor,
The Lindsays flew like fire about till all the fray was done.
The fray was done at the Otterburn at the breaking of the day,
Earl Douglas was buried at the bracken bush, and the <persName key="Percy, Henry">Percy</persName> was led

On the morrow they made them biers, of the birch and the hazel grey,
Many a widow with weeping tears her mate did bear away.
There was never a time in the March-parts, when Douglas and <persName key="Percy, Henry">Percy</persName>

No man withstood him, for he was within his right, and he took care neither to break the law or show anger against those who had put his friends to death, even replacing the Appellants in the Council at the request of <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>, upon whose advice and that of his own wife Ann he chiefly leaned. <note place="foot" n="1"><placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s peaceful rule, <dateRange from="1389" to="1397">1389-1397</dateRange>.</note>
For eight years there was peace and good rule.
Many wise laws were made: the great Statute ofProvisors; a statute against livery and maintenance (forbidding lords to give their badges to any but their own servants and tenants, or to meddle with other men's quarrels or lawsuits) ; a law fixing the limits of the Constable's and Marshal's courts in
<date value ="1390">1390</date>; an Act forbidding the manor courts to try cases touching ownership of land in <date value ="1391">1391</date>; the great Statte of
Premunire in <date value ="1393">1393</date>. In <date value ="1394">1394</date> good Queen Ann breathed her last at Shene. <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> was beside himself with grief; he had the palace where she died razed to the ground, and struck Arundel in the abbey itself for keeping the funeral waiting. <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> also fell out with Arundel about this time, for the earl did not like the duke to have the duchy of
Aquitaine, which <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> had given him in <date value ="1390">1390</date>, and wished for war with France, which John and <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> rightly thought unwise. He even tried to rouse the Cheshire men against
Lancaster, but they were easily quieted. However, the king soon forgave Arundel, and even gave his brother the archbishopric of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> on Courtnay's death, nor, though he paid great honour to his uncle, did <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> favour his wish to get his son, the Earl of Derby, made heir in place of the
Earl of March, in case the king died childless. As things were going badly in Ireland, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> made up his mind to cross to the Pale and see how it was that a land which was once of profit to the crown now proved a burden. The
Irish kings and chiefs, O'Connor, MacMorrough, O'Brien,
O'Neil, and others, were after a while willing to obey him; but the lords of the Pale, the Butlers and Geraldines, gave much more trouble, as they quarrelled with each other, and would not suffer the natives outside the Pale to live in peace.
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> held a Parliament, did what he could to settle the country, and left his cousin the Earl of March as Lord Deputy, when he himself was called home, after nine months' stay, by Archbishop Arundel, who wished for his help against the Lollards. For in the Parliament of <date value ="1394">1394</date>, held by the Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> for the absent king, they had a strong party in the Lower House, and had brought in a petition

 touching the state of the Church, in which they condemned confession, the mass, pilgrimage, image-worship, and many of the ceremonies of the Church; objected to the clergy being endowed, taking lay offices, and not marrying; and declared that war and capital punishment were sinful, and the making of jewels and weapons unrighteous, wasteful, and needless crafts. The king called Lord Montague and others of these opinions before him and <quote>" snubbed them, forbidding them to maintain such matters any more,"</quote> and making them take an oath to that effect.</p>
  <p>9. In <date value ="1396">1396</date> <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, wishing to put an end to the French war during his days, made a twenty-eight years' truce with
<persName key="Charles VI.">Charles VI.</persName>and wedded his little daughter Isabel, a child of eight years old. The two kings met near Calais, where the wedding took place with great pomp, the married pair walking between two lines of French and English knights, four hundred of each, all in rich array. The whole festival cost <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> 300,000 marks, but the princess's dowry was
300,000 crowns paid at once, and 100,000 a year for five years.
The Duke of Gloucester had spared no endeavour to put a stop to this match, for he liked the war, in which he hoped to win money and glory, and he now began again to do all in his power to thwart and humble the king and his friends, spreading every kind of story about their lives and doings which could make the people dislike them.   <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, willing to be rid of him on easy terms, gave him the government of Ireland; but he soon threw it up, for he could get nothing but hard fighting there, and though he started on a crusade to Prussia, he came back after a few days at sea.

In <date value ="1397">1397</date> Gloucester, having many friends in the Commons, led them to send up a bill complaining (a) that the sheriffs were kept in office more than a year; (b) that the
Scottish marches were ill-guarded; (c) that the statutes of <date value ="1390">1390</date> against livery and maintenance were not fairly kept (an attack upon the king's friends, who spread his badge, the hart, widely among the gentry); (d) that there were too many foreign ladies and alien bishops maintained in the royal household at the king's expense. <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> agreed to look into the first points; but saying that the Commons had no right to meddle with his guests, he sent Canon Thomas Haxey, who brought in the bill, to be tried for treason by the Lords, though when they found him guilty he pardoned him. But Gloucester, putting down <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s forbearance to fear, pushed his violence so far as to openly and unjustly reproach his nephew at

 a banquet as a coward and sluggard for not making war on France, when according to sworn treaty Brest and
Cherbourg were given up to their owners, the Duke of
Brittany and the King of Navarre. But the king still withheld his hand till he heard from the Earl of Nottingham, who had quarrelled with Gloucester, that his uncle was plotting with Warwick and the two Arundels to imprison him and seize the government again. Showing no sign of displeasure, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> asked the four to a banquet. Warwick alone appearing, was arrested after the dinner and sent to Tintagel under guard. The archbishop was persuaded by promise that his brother's life should be safe to make him surrender, when he was put in prison at Carisbrooke. <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> then with a large armed following rode to
Plashy, Gloucester's seat, and took him, saying, <q type="spoken">" Since thou wilt not come to me I am come to thee."</q> <q type="spoken">" My lord, have mercy and spare my life !"</q>  <q type="spoken">"Thou shalt have the mercy
Burley got when the queen prayed for him. Read this!"</q> and with that he handed him the charges against him. "<q type="spoken"> They shall surely be answered,"</q> replied Gloucester, who was then borne off to Calais under Nottingham's care. The ringleaders being thus trapped, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> gathered a body-guard of stout yeomen from his earldom of Chester, and called a
Parliament, at which it was settled that the Earls of Nottingham, Rutland, Somerset, <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, Huntingdon, <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName>, and
Salisbury, Baron Despenser and Sir William Scrope (the
Earl of Suffolk's kinsman), should appeal the prisoners of treason. The Parliament met, 17th September, in a great shed open at the sides, which were guarded by the Cheshire men with bent bows, for the Hall of Westminster was being rebuilt. The Commons had been carefully chosen under the eye of the sheriffs and lords of the king's party, for
Gloucester's friends were cowed, while the Lords were willing to follow <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>'s lead, and the clergy, fearing for their sees, were not willing to interfere on either side.
The statute of <date value ="1386">1386</date> and the pardons given to the earls in <date value ="1388">1388</date> and <date value ="1398">1398</date> were repealed as being granted under compulsion.
When Arundel was accused he said to the Duke of Lancaster, <q type="spoken">" It is no use my answering. I know you will condemn me to get my lands."</q> <q type="spoken">"Thou mayest lawfully be beheaded without defence, for it is the Parliament that charge thee."</q>
<q type="spoken">"What I did, I did for reasons that were then good, and

 accord."</q>  <q type="spoken">"That too is recalled by Parliament."</q>  <q type="spoken">"The king may pardon whom he will, and if thou sayest he cannot, thou dost more against his royal rights than ever did I, and of a truth if thou wert tried thou shouldst be found to be more of a traitor than I."</q> <q type="spoken">"Thou art found guilty of the charges the Commons bring against thee, therefore put thyself upon the king's mercy."</q> <q type="spoken">"The faithful Commons are not here,"</q> answered Arundel, <q type="spoken">"and I put myself upon the mercy of the High King of Heaven, and for the law and commonwealth of England I am ready to die."</q> So he was judged to be beheaded on Tower Hill, where he had put
Burley to death, and early on the morrow, 21st September, his head was smitten off. There was a strong guard about the place, for the Londoners pitied him, and it was feared that they would try a rescue. Gloucester was not allowed to appear, but was smothered by Nottingham's orders at an inn in Calais. Yet sentence was passed upon his dead body, for ere Parliament met he had confessed his guilt to one of the judges. Warwick, who also confessed, was imprisoned in the
Isle of Man, for the king would not put so old a man to death.  The archbishop was banished, but refused to go.
<q type="spoken">" I will die where I was born."</q> However the king said, <q type="spoken">" Do not grieve, my lord, nor refuse to go, for thou shalt shortly be recalled, and there shall be no other archbishop in thy place while we two live."</q> <q type="spoken">" I will go then,"</q> said Arundel angrily,
<q type="spoken">" but before I go I have somewhat to say to thee ;"</q> and he spoke long and sharply against the pride, greed, and other sins of the king and his friends. The Parliament then declared treason to lie in planning the king's death or removal, giving up the homage due to him and raising war against him, and pronounced Nottingham and Derby guiltless of this offence. The king now rewarded his friends for their help, making the Earls of Nottingham, Derby, Rutland,
Huntingdon, and <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, Dukes of Norfolk, Hereford, Aumale,
<placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, and <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName>. The Earl of Somerset (<persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>'s son by his third wife) was created Marquess of Dorset;
Barons Despenser and Neville, Earls of Gloucester and Westmoreland; Sir Thomas Percy and Sir William Scrope, Earls of Worcester and Wilts. Chester was made a principality.
Roger Waldon the treasurer was made Archbishop of
<placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> in spite of the king's promise to Arundel, and
Henry Beaufort, Dorset's brother, was made Bishop of Lincoln. In January <date value ="1398">1398</date> the same Parliament met again at
Shrewsbury, when they gave <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> more power than any
English king had been trusted with. They granted him the



<pb id="p.259" n="259"/>


 customs on wool, woolfells, and leather for his life; they gave up their own power to a board chosen from among the king's friends, and made up of ten nobles for the Lords (of whom six might be a quorum), two earls for the clergy, and six commoners (of whom four would be a quorum), who were
<quote>"to answer and determine all petitions and matters therein contained, as well as all matters or things moved in the king's presence [in Council], and all things thereon dependent which were not yet settled, according to their good counsel and wisdom by full power of Parliament."</quote> All these Acts were confirmed and declared irrepealable by a bull of Pope
<persName key="Boniface VIII.">Boniface VIII.</persName>. But the people laughed at the <soCalled>" Dukelings,"</soCalled> and the clergy grumbled against the Pope and the king.</p>
  <p><placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> ruled through the men who had managed the
Commons for him in this Parliament, Bushy the Speaker,
Scrope, Bagot, and Green, and he overawed his foes by his
Cheshire guards, who were heartily fond of him and would say to him, as the story goes, <q type="spoken">"Sleep in peace, Dickon, we will take care of thee, and if thou hadst married Sir Perkin's daughter of Lee, thou mightest have defied all the lords in
England."</q> But he was not easy in his mind; he regretted
Arundel's death, and he was ever fearful of some fresh plot against him, for he knew that the Londoners (with whom he had quarrelled in <date value ="1392">1392</date> because they would not lend him money) disliked him, and that many of the nobles distrusted him. He therefore tried to strengthen himself, he borrowed money by forced loans, he made London and seventeen of the shires ransom themselves by paying him large sums called the <soCalled>"Pleasaunce,"</soCalled> and he led many merchants and gentlefolk to sign blank charters to be filled up as he chose with promises of faithfulness. Moreover he sought to gain friends by giving his badge, a white hart of silver, to be worn on the arm or neck as a token of his special favour and protection. And as he was rich and well guarded, and a man who would risk much to win favour, he might have lived down much of the illwill against him, and ruled long and fairly, had he not set the powerful house of Lancaster against him by his lack of good faith. It happened that Norfolk, fearing for his life, tried to draw Hereford into a bond which he and Aumale,
<placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, and Worcester had entered into against <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName>,
Salisbury, Wilts, and Gloucester; but Hereford refused and appealed his former friend oftreason. Norfolk denied it, and it was settled that they should fight a wager of battle. But
<persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> begged <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> not to let them fight, and when the two champions rode armed into the lists at Coventry, 16th

September, before a vast throng of onlookers, the fight was altogether stopped, and both dukes made to swear to leave the realm. Hereford was to stay away for ten years, Norfolk never to return. Both were given pensions out of their estates, and were to enjoy all rights in England as if they had not been banished. <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, who had gone abroad after
<date value ="1388">1388</date>, had won fame by fighting in two crusades against the heathen-in Barbary, <date value ="1390">1390</date>, and in Prussia, <date value ="1391">1391</date>, whence he had gone as far as Rhodes on the way to Jerusalem. He was the best-loved man in England at this time, and the people pressed in weeping crowds to take leave of him.  But
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, who was dreaming of being made Emperor, and listening to his flatterers' prophecies of great glory to come, paid no heed to this, and so far from making friends with his cousin, sent Salisbury to Paris to break off his marriage with the Duke of Berry's daughter, and recalled the rights he had given him; so that when <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName> died in <date value ="1399">1399</date>, he would not suffer <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s agent to take his estates, but seized them himself.  <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> thereupon went to Brittany, to his kinsman the duke, that he might be ready to come back to
England if any chance should offer, and make <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> do him right. He had not long to wait.</p>

The Earl of March had been killed by the <soCalled>" wild Irish"</soCalled> at Kenlys, July 20, <date value ="1398">1398</date>, and now that all was outwardly at peace in England, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> was minded to go over to Ireland and stay there till he had established good government once for all. He made his will, leaving all his money to his heir on condition that he upheld the Acts of the two last
Parliaments, appointed his uncle, the Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, Keeper of the Realm, and then sailed with many of his nobles, May
<date value ="1396">1396</date>. As soon as <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> heard that he was gone he set out from Brittany with Archbishop Arundel and his nephew (the dead earl's son), Sir Thomas Erpingham, and forty men, and landed at Ravenspur, July 4, swearing to the northern lords who joined him that he was come to claim his heritage and to put an end to the bad rule of the king's friends, but not to touch the crown. The Keeper was won over, 27th July;
<placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName> surrendered, and the king's friends there, Wilts,
Bushy, and Green, hanged. <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> sent Salisbury to gather troops at Conway, promising to follow him at once; yet he did not come for three weeks, when he landed at Beaumaris.
But there his own men fled from him, and he fell into despair and cursed the untruth of England, saying, <q type="spoken">"Alas! what faith is there in this false world?"</q> and instead of



<pb id="p.261" n="261"/>


 going to Bordeaux, where he would have found help and welcome, left his treasure and fled in disguise to Conway.
He found no help there, Salisbury's levies had gone home, tired of waiting for him.  Ere he could make fresh plans he was lured by <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>'s false oath out of his stronghold and brought to Flint.  <q type="spoken">"Fool that I was,"</q> he cried when he found himself betrayed, <q type="spoken">"to have saved the life of this <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> of Lancaster three times, as I have, yea, when his own father would have had him die for his treason and wickedness! 'Tis a true saying indeed, <quote>'Your worst foe is him you free from the gallows."'</quote></q>
When he saw Lancaster he smiled and said, <q type="spoken">"Welcome, fair cousin "</q> <q type="spoken">"I am come home before my time, sir,"</q> answered Lancaster, bowing, <q type="spoken">"for your people complain that you have ruled them harshly for a score of years or more, but now if it please God I will help you to rule better." </q> <q type="spoken">"If it please you, it pleaseth us well,"</q> replied <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>. They then started for London. At Lichfield the king tried to escape, but was retaken and henceforth strictly guarded.  The
Londoners welcomed <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> with joy, but hooted and groaned as the king was led to the Tower.  Before the
Parliament that had been called could meet, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, seeing no present hope, agreed in writing to give up the crown.
New writs were issued for a fresh Parliament to meet in six days. When it met, the resignation was read in English and Latin and accepted.  Thirty-three charges against
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> were then read, which accused him (a) of having acted wrongfully towards Archbishop Arundel and the
Appellants; (b) of having packed Parliaments by means of the sheriffs, and got them to give up their lawful rights to him; (c) of having lowered the free crown of England by seeking the Pope's approval of Acts of Parliament; (d) of having raised unlawful taxes, loans, purveyance, and ransoms; (e) of having broken the laws as to the sheriffs and royal officers and judges; (f) of having made an unrighteous will; (g) of having said and held that the laws lay in his own mouth, and that he could change them as he liked, and that the life, lands, and goods of every man were at his mercy without trial. The Parliament voted these charges true and sufficient grounds for setting the king aside, and sent Seven Commissioners to tell him so. Only one man, Thomas Marks, Bishop of <placeName key="Carlisle">Carlisle</placeName>, spoke up for his master, and asked for a fair trial, but he was not listened to.
As soon as the throne was declared vacant the Duke of
Lancaster rose, and crossing himself said, <q type="spoken">" In the name of

Whereon the Three Estates severally and together agreed to take him as king. Then <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> having knelt down and prayed a while in their midst, was handed to the throne by the two archbishops. After a sermon from Arundel on the text, <quote>"Behold the man whom

<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> spoke again, <q type="spoken">" Sirs, I thank you, both spiritual and temporal, and all the Estates of the land, and I do you to wit that it is not my will that any man should think that by way of conquest I would disinherit any man of his heritage, liberties, or other rights that he ought to have, or put him out of that he hath and hath had by the good laws of this realm, save those that have been against the good state and common profit of the realm."</q> And on the morrow,
1st October, Sir William Thirning, as the spokesman of the
Seven Commissioners, went to the Tower and addressed
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, saying, <q type="spoken">"Sir, ye remember you well that ye renounced and put off the state of king and lordship and of all the dignity that belongeth thereto."</q>  <q type="spoken">"Yea,"</q> said <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>,
<q type="spoken">"but not the ghostly honour of the royal anointing, which I could not renounce or put off."</q> But Thirning went on to say that <q type="spoken">"his renunciation and cession was plainly accepted and fully agreed to by all the Estates and people. And besides this, sir, at the instance of all the Estates and people there were certain articles of default in your governance there read and then well heard and plainly understood by all the

<q type="spoken">" I am but using your words, sir,"</q> answered Thirning.
<q type="spoken">" Well," </q>said <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> smiling, <q type="spoken">" I look for no more, but after all this I hope that my cousin will be good lord to me."</q>

This was the imprisoned king's last free utterance. On the

Pomfret. His after fate is as yet unknown.</p>
  <p>11. <note place="foot" n="10"><placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s reign and character.</note>
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> was ruined, as William Langland says, by redelessness or lack of good counsel. He was not an idle trifler like <persName key="Edward II.">Edward II.</persName>, nor a shiftless spendthrift like <persName key="Henry III.">Henry III.</persName>, but a singularly gifted man, handsome, brave, generous, intelligent, merciful, and able to act boldly and quickly when he chose. His path was never free from difficulty and danger, family quarrels, foreign hatred, and English discontent, a heritage of trouble that came to him with his crown; but he was on the verge of safety when he ruined himself by two or three false steps taken in the interest of his friends rather than of himself or his people. He was ill-advised when for peace' sake he let the irritating misdeeds of his brothers, his officers, and his guard go unpunished; ill-advised when out of love for art, splendour, and a fair life he kept up a grand court, and was the patron of poets, painters, and architects, though he knew that his people grudged spending money on anything but war; ill-advised when, impatient at the ceaseless falsehood and plots of his kinsmen, he used haughty language, and spoke of his royal rights as above the law; and still more ill-advised when he tried to govern well, without consulting the likes and dislikes of the people he had to rule, banishing their favourites, breaking down their privileges, mocking at their cherished beliefs, and overriding the rights to which they clung. But <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> was no brutal or heartless tyrant, and if his luck had not left him, he might have put away the follies, set right the mistakes into which his youth and his young counsellors had led him, and so reigned more happily than his supplanter. However, he had had his chance and failed, and the English people, perhaps rightly, would not give him another, though he had a few warm friends who could not forget his fair face and open hand, and pitied his fate.

                     <head> CHAPTER V: England in the Fourteenth Century</head>

       

  <p>1. It was in the fourteenth century that the order of life and society which we call medieval reached its height in
England. The Church was richer than ever, the division of classes more marked, the trading and commercial guilds thriving as they had never yet. All the forms of medieval art and literature seem to have come into full flower, and the law and constitution were certainly in as perfect a state as the circumstances and ideas of the day allowed.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="1">English constitution and finance in the fourteenth century.</note>
  Taking the constitution first, one is especially struck by the growth and strength of Parliament. For in England in the fourteenth century the clergy did not become stronger though they grew richer, the kings fell more and more under the sway of Parliament; while it was in and through Parliament that the younger branches of the royal family, who headed the opposition to the Crown, contrived to get their way.  It was in this century that the English Parliament took the form to which it has ever after kept, and in this century that it gained great part of the powers and privileges which it has maintained to this day. It now first set forth plainly its own rights of free speech and self-rule, and insisted that the claims of Pope and Church, the regaly or prerogative of the king, and the rights of the subject should be clearly marked off by statute. It clinched the work of Archbishop Stephen and the Righteous Earl by not allowing a penny to be raised in taxes from Englishman or alien in England without its consent, and it gained complete control over the moneys it voted, It decided between peace and war, and fixed the lines within which the country should be ruled, upholding in a striking way its right to punish unrighteous ministers, and to set up or pull down the king himself <quote>"for default of lawful governance."</quote>  Great changes took place in its own composition. 1. To begin with the Clergy. The lower clergy, that is, the dean, archdeacon, and proctor [representative] for the chapter [cathedral body] who came from each cathedral, and the two proctors who represented the beneficed clergy in each see, about 100 members in all, soon ceased to sit with the Knights and Burgesses. For after the Bull
Clericis Laicos they did not like to join laymen in voting money out of Church goods and lands. So it came about



<pb id="p.267" n="267"/>

 that the kings allowed the archbishops to gather the bishops, abbots, and lower clergy in two separate bodies, called the
Convocations of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, which were not Houses of Parliament at all, though in them the clergy used to make rules for their own order, subject to royal approval and the
Church law, and were wont to vote gifts of money to the king in due proportion to the taxes voted in Parliament by the laymen.  For as long as the clergy paid their fair share neither the king nor the people cared whether they taxed themselves in Parliament or out of it, especially as the bishops and abbots, as of old, still sat with the Lords in
Parliament. 2. The House of Lords now often appears as a court in which great officers impeached [accused] by the
Commons of state-offences are tried, and as the place of appeal to which knotty cases of the common law could finally be brought and settled. There were from 150 to 100 Lords, the numbers tending to lessen, but the greater part being always spiritual peers. About the end of the century the number of the latter was fixed as 21 bishops and 27 abbots and priors. Dukes and earls were made by the king with consent of Parliament till <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName> took to making all peers by patent [open] letters under his seal.  Bishops were chosen by the chapters of their sees, at the king's recommendation, and with the Pope's goodwill; abbots and priors were chosen by their monks and confirmed by the king.
3. The House of Commons now began to take up a well-marked line of its own. Sitting apart under their own
Speaker, the Commons refused to join in the law-work of the
Upper House (though theysometimes accused State criminals before it), and chiefly busied themselves with the nation's money matters; for the burden of the taxes fell chiefly upon them, and it was their interest to see that the money they voted was carefully gathered and thriftily spent. They also in their petitions begged the king to have various laws made to remedy the evils they noticed in the realm. The king and the Lords sometimes disagreed with these petitions, but if they agreed, the petition was granted and enrolled as a Statute or Act of Parliament. The Lower House was made up of about 300 members (37 counties returning 2 knights apiece;
London and <placeName key="York">York</placeName> each sending 4 citizens; the Cinque Ports with their 16 barons; and about 150 boroughs with 2 burgesses each). It was by keeping the strings of the purse that Parliament was able to hold its own against king and Pope.
Luckily the ordinary royal income, The king's own, was barely enough to keep him in time of peace; and when he was at



<pb id="p.268" n="268"/>

 war, as he often was, he must needs seek help from Parliament at last, though he often tried to avoid this by various devices, taxing strangers or the Jews (till they were driven out), borrowing  money from foreign merchants (which answered well enough till the Lombard bankers were ruined and the Flemings refused to lend any more) or getting loans from rich folk.  Parliament was wise enough only to give money on condition that the king should rule to please them or that he should set his seal to laws they wanted, and in this way the Parliaments quietly bought many rights by gold which the barons in the foregoing century had shed their blood to secure.</p>
  <p>The following table will show the state of the regular revenue on an average :
<figure id="Fig.024" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.001.DO01.00024"><head>Regular revenue</head></figure>

</p>
  <p>The control of the Law was still in the king's hands, but as the Parliament called unjust judges to account, the courts were on the whole freer than they had been before from the royal caprices. The three Common-Law Courts, with their regular staffs, were full of work, and cases they would not touch were regularly heard and settled by the Chancellor or
Keeper of the Privy Seal. The Church Courts had their own business, cases relating to wills, marriages, tithes, and religious offences, and were not allowed to meddle with the common law.
The Royal Council and the Courts of the Royal Officers were forbidden to judge any man to lose life, limb, or land, which could only be done before a jury in the Common-Law Courts.
The Justices of the Peace were rapidly replacing the manor courts and hundred courts, and checked as they were by the


<pb id="p.269" n="269"/>

 royal Justices of Assize, gave better and fairer law than the old courts, which were mostly in the hands of the stewards of the king or the great lords, who often abused their power.
In most of the towns the power was passing into the hands of the great trade-guilds, who named the town councillors for the different wards, and with the aldermen chose the burgesses, mayor, and other officers. The big towns were one by one, after the old example of London, freed from the control of the sheriff of their county, and left to choose their own sheriffs as counties corporate.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">Trade, prices and wages in the fourteenth century.</note>
  In spite of pirates, evil seasons, famines, and plagues,
English trade grew steadily during this century, and latterly the strong companies of the Staple and Merchant Adventurers did much to forward commerce where single traders would have failed. The fish trade with Norway; the hide, hemp, bullion, and timber trade with the North Sea and Baltic ports; the wine and salt trade with Gascony; the wool trade with
Flanders,--all flourished, and we were now setting up a new and well-paying business, by beginning to make up our own wool, thus saving the risks of double carriage and getting a profit we had hitherto left to foreigners. <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> wisely encouraged Flemish wool-workers to settle in the eastern counties and teach their trade to the people, and in like manner he welcomed all foreign craftsmen who could teach
English artisans any hitherto-unknown ways of work, so that
English cloth, metal-work, pottery, and glass soon showed much improvement.</p>
  <p>The great fairs of Weyhill, Stourbridge, Abingdon, and
St. Giles (<placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>) were still the marts for the midland counties, as the great staple-towns by the sea were for the east, west, and south coasts. The many royal merchants
(such as Mich&#x00E6;l at Poole, or de la Pole of Hull) who became founders of noble families during this century and the next, show the great prizes which were open to far-seeing and industrious traders :-
       <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"And still with worship [honour] think I on that sun</l>

        <l> And what profit hath been of his richesse,</l>
        <l> And yet doth daily last in worthiness ! "</l></quote></p>
  <p>A slight debasement of the money, a bad policy borrowed from France, was more than made up for by <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>'s care for the coinage, for plenty of money was needed for the



<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>

 trade of those days.   He even struck gold pieces, at first florins of 6s., copies of the Florentine crowns, and afterwards nobles of 6s. 8d. with the image of himself in full armour standing with drawn sword on board a ship, a memory of the sea-fight of Sluys. But in spite of this proud device, piracy was still rife in the narrow seas, and rather increased than lessened through the reign of <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>, while the letters of reprisals granted to English merchants who had suffered from  Breton, Friesland, or Flemish pirates only made matters worse, and our carrying trade began somewhat to fall off in consequence.</p>
   <p>The effects of the Black Death have been noticed above.
It brought the population down from four to two millions, doubled wages, and generally raised prices about one-fifth.
Wheat was now     worth about 5s. 10d. and oats 2s. per quarter, an ox 8s. 6d., but a sheep not more than 1s. 6d., for the increase of sheep-farming kept the price down. On the whole, the poor were better fed, better clothed, and better paid than in the former century, though their lot was none the less hard enough, as the poet's portrait of the ploughman shows:-
  <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"His coat of the cloth that is named carry-marry [a coarse cloth];</l>
<l>    His hood full of holes, with his hair sticking through them;</l>
<l>    His clumsy knobbed shoes cobbled over so thickly,</l>
<l>    Though his toes started out, as he trod on the ground;</l>
<l>    His hose hanging over each side of his hoggers [gaiters],</l>
<l>    All plashed in the puddles as he followed the plough;</l>
<l>    His two miserable mittens made out of old rags,</l>
<l>    The fingers worn out, and the filth clotted on them.</l>
<l>    He went wading in mud, almost up to the ankles,</l>
<l>    And before him four oxen, so weary and feeble,</l>
<l>    One could reckon their ribs, so rueful were they.</l>
<l>      His wife walked beside him, with a long ox-goad,</l>
<l>    In a clouted coat cut short to the knee,</l>
<l>    Wrapped in a winnowing-sheet to keep out the weather.</l>
<l>    Her bare feet on the bleak ice bled as she went.</l>
<l>    At one end of the acre, in a crumb-bowl so small,</l>
<l>    A little babe lay, lapped up in rags.</l>
<l>    And twins, two-years-old, tumbled beside it,</l>
<l>    All singing one song that was sorrowful hearing,</l>
<l>    For they all cried one cry, a sad note of care."</l></quote>
And of the yeoman's food William writes:-
    <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"I have no penny," quoth Piers Plowman, 
    </l><l>" pullets to buy,</l>
   <l>   Nor goose nor grice [young pig], but two green cheeses,</l>
   <l>   And a few curds and cream, and an oaten cake,</l>
   <l>   And a loaf of beans and bran, baked for my children.</l>
   <l>   I have no salt side of bacon to slice up for collops. ..</l>
   <l>   But parsley and leeks and many kale-plants,</l>
   <l>   And chervil and shalots, and cherries and apples."</l></quote>

 	<p>From the reign of <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName> we begin to get pretty full
 records of courts, councils, and parliaments, beside the
 account-rolls and charters which abound. Of law treatises there are <hi rend="italics">Fleta, the Miror des  Justices</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Judges' Looking-glass,</hi> and others of the end of the thirteenth century.   To the beginning of the next belongs the <foreign lang="LA">Modus tenendi Parliamentum</foreign>, or How Parliament is held. The Custom-Book of
London, put together by Andrew Horn, <date value ="1320">1320</date>, and the old
Law-Book, <date value ="1274">1274</date>, give full accounts of the City bylaws.  The customs of the guilds were collected by <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>'s orders in <date value ="1382">1382</date>.</p>
<p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">Fourteenth Century or Decorated architecture in England.</note>
The architecture of this time was more richly decorated than earlier styles had been; the roofs being loftier, the doors and windows larger and more freely adorned; the pillar-shafts, piers, and buttresses more strikingly fashioned and ingeniously set.  The mouldings are thick with carved flowers, and every spire, canopy, and pinnacle of wood, metal, or stone is edged with delicate curling leaf-work.
There is more show and splendour about every building, and there is something of extravagance in the enormous west windows of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, Durham, and Lichfield, the Round Tower of Windsor, built by <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> for a banqueting-room, and the loftiness of Westminster Hall as restored by
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>. But, on the other hand, all domestic buildings were far more carefully planned and skilfully contrived for comfort than before, without, too, losing any of their beauty; such are William of Wyckham's New College at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> and Winchester, William Rede's Library at Merton, and the beautiful convents which the friars were raising in every big town.
The Wycliffite poet thus describes a great London convent, which is a good example of fourteenth century architecture :-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>" When one came to the court it was comely to see,</l>
<l>   The pillars were polished and painted so bright,</l>
<l>   And quaintly carven with curious knots,</l>
<l>   And the windows so well wrought high up in the walls;</l>
<l>   For though it was wide, the whole place was walled in</l>
<l>   With small posterns [wicket-doors] in places by which to pass out.</l>
<l>   There were orchards and herb-gardens all in the court,</l>
<l>   And a curious cross right cunningly sculptured.</l>
<l>     The minster [church] I marked too, and its marvellous building,</l>
<l>   The arches on each side so artfully carven,</l>
<l>   And the crockets on the corners were craftily gilt.</l>
<l>   The wide windows of glass set so thick on the walls,</l>
<l>   Shining with shields, a sight to behold,</l>
<l>   With merchants' marks a many mingled among them.</l>



<pb id="p.272" n="272"/>


<l>   Tombs trimly covered with tabernacle-work [carved canopies],</l>
<l>   And armed men upon then wrought out of alabaster,</l>
<l>   And lovely ladies lying by their sides</l>
<l>   In gay-coloured garments gold-beaten all.</l>
<l>     Pillared and painted so proudly was the cloister,</l>
<l>     Roofed with lead low down to the line of the stonework,</l>
<l>     Paved with painted tiles all of one pattern,</l>
<l>     With tin tanks for water so tidily jointed,</l>
<l>     And lavers [wash-places] of latten [brass] so deftly laid down.</l>
<l>     The chapter-house [meeting-hall] too, it was like a great church</l>
<l>     With a seemly ceiling set up aloft,</l>
<l>     And painted all round like a parliament-house.</l>
<l>   And further in the friary was another fair hall [guest-chamber]</l>
<l>   That would hold the household of any high king,</l>
<l>   With broad boards [tables] set round it, and benches so fair.</l>
<l>   There were chambers [dining-rooms] with chimneys, and beautiful
        chapels,</l>
<l>    And kitchens such as kings have in their castles;</l>
<l>    And a dormitory duly furnished, shut in with strong doors,</l>
<l>    An infirmary and refectory, and full many rooms more,</l>
<l>    And gay garrets above, with each window of glass."</l></quote>
As ever before, so in this age, famous men showed their taste for fair and stately buildings.  <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName> set up the jewel-like Eleanor crosses as memorials of the wife he loved
<quote>"alive and dead."</quote>   Burnell the chancellor and
<persName key="Mortimer, Roger">Roger Mortimer</persName> raised the western fastnesses of Acton Burnell and
Ludlow. Bishop Beck and Lords Nevill and <persName key="Percy, Henry">Percy</persName> built, or rebuilt, the northern strongholds of Auckland, Raby, and
Alnwick. The central palace-castles of Kenilworth and
Pomfret were enlarged by <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> and <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>.
Archbishop Courtenay and <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName> raised the fortresses of Saltwood and Southampton to guard the south; while nearly every baronial family had its crenelated mansion walled and embattled by leave of the king.</p>
  <p>The ordinary house of the middle classes had a hall, in which the daily household life and work went on; an upper chimneyed chamber, where the master and his wife and children sat and even ate (for the old custom of the whole house-hold dining together in the hall was dying out save at special seasons); a kitchen with buttery and cellar for stores ; and two or three sleeping-rooms on the upper story, or in lofts reached by an outside stair or ladder of wood. A byre and stable were attached to most houses, and the little yard, round three sides of which the house was built, and which often contained an elder-tree, or a vine, and a draw-well, was closed on the fourth by a high wall.</p>
   <p>4. The armour and arms of the middle ages were never more workmanlike and beautiful than in the fourteenth century


<pb id="p.273" n="273"/>

 in England. In the knight's array plate was now added to mail. The coat-of-mail was covered by a breastplate.<note place="foot" n="4">Armour and arms in the fourteenth century.</note> were buckled broad bands of steel, brassards and
Upon the mail sleeves and hose vambraces, cuissards and jambards joined by steel coudieres and genouilleres at elbow and knee. A tippet of mail, the cap-mail, covered neck and shoulders, and was laced to the steel cap or bassinet which guarded the head. This was also fitted with a hinged avantail or face-guard, pierced for eyesight and breathing. In the tournament a huge iron helm buckled to the breastplate sheltered both head and neck from spear-thrusts, though it was too unwieldy for real war. The coat-of-arms was still worn, and over it at the hips knights bore a jewelled belt of metal holding the dagger and sword-sheath.  <hi rend="italics">Gauntlets</hi> and <hi rend="italics">sollerets</hi> [shoes] of small jointed plates were now first used. The lance was heavier and the shield smaller and, more curved than before.
Even the knight's charger often carried a mail poitral, or breast-guard, and a plate chanfront, or head-cover, under the long flowing mantling; and top-clothes painted or embroidered with his rider's arms.</p>
  <p>As for the archer, <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>, who had fought beside him in
France, draws his picture :
    <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"And he was clad in coat and hood of green,</l>
<l>    A sheaf of peacock arrows bright and keen</l>
<l>    Under his belt he bare full carefully.</l>
<l>    Well could he trim his tackle yeomanly.</l>
<l>    His arrows drooped not with feathers low,</l>
<l>    And in his hand he bare a mighty bow.</l>
<l>    A nut-head had he with a brown visage.</l>
<l>    Of woodcraft well he knew all the usage.</l>
<l>    Upon his arm he bare a gay bracer,</l>
<l>    And by his side a sword and buckler [small round shield],</l>
<l>    And on the other side a gay dagger,</l>
<l>    Well mounted and as sharp as point of spear,</l>
<l>    A Christofer [brooch with St. Christopher's image] on his
         breast of silver sheen;</l>
<l>     An horn he bare, its baldric [shoulder-belt] was of green."</l></quote>

And the Welsh romancer talks of <quote>" the bow of red yew "</quote> with its tough tight string of sinew or silk-bound hemp, and the
<quote>"straight smoothly-rounded shaft with its evenly-cut neck, its long slender feathers deftly fastened on with green silk, and its heavy, thick, inch-broad steel head tempered to a blue-green, and sharp enough to draw blood out of a weather-cock."</quote></p>
  <p>The power of well-handled archers was indeed so great that the French king dare not, as was commonly said in


<pb id="p.274" n="274"/>

England, arm his yoemen and peasants with bow and arrow, lest they should rise and destroy the knights and gentry, who could not withstand their attack.</p>
  <p>Cannons were now used in sieges and battles, but they were only less clumsy, dangerous, and hard to move than the old war-slings and <hi rend="italics">trapgets</hi> and <hi rend="italics">springalds</hi> [catapults] which were still employed, and hand-guns were as yet far too slow-firing and awkward to replace bows and crossbows.</p>
  <p>In Scotland the pike and the broad-axe, or the long-shafted
Lochaber hatchets, were used by the heavy-armed footmen; for though the Highlanders had bows and arrows, the Lowland Scots never became good bowmen, though many laws were passed to further archery. The Scottish knights were armed like their English and French fellows, and were noted for their strength and skill.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="5">Pastimes and pilgrimages.</note>Life in England in the middle ages was not dull, and there was no. lack of merriment in spite of all the troubles of the time, for beside the great church festivals, guild feasts, May games, summer games, wakes, Yule feasts, and the like, there were often pageants and processions in the towns at coronations, great men's weddings, and other public occasions.  Both round dances and step-dancing were very favourite pastimes, and many songs were written for dancers to sing. All kinds of music, too, were brought in from abroad; beside the organ, harp, pipe, horn, and tabrets, which had long been played in England, there were viols, and citherns, and bagpipes, and drums, and shawms. Bands of musicians played and sung at feasts and pageants, and in the churches. The English and Welsh were especially skilled in part-singing, and there are hundreds of old songs on all subjects in old vellum books of this time. The mystery plays, too, were now at their best. These were sets of dramas showing forth in order the stories of the Old and
New Testaments, acted by the workmen of the several craftguilds or mysteries [metiers] : thus the vintners would act the Marriage of Cana, the carpenters Noah's Ark, and so on. They were played in the open air, like the Passion plays still to be seen in Tyrol and Biscaya, and often took two or three days to perform. Several sets of them which were played in Chester, Coventry and Cornwall are still remaining.
<persName key="Edward II.">Edward II.</persName> was very fond of these plays, and they became so popular that in many places regular companies were formed for playing them. Another very common way of spending a holiday in these days was going a pilgrimage. Of course to go oversea to S. James of Galicia, or to Rome, or the Holy

Land, was a serious undertaking, and done out of religious zeal; but there were many places of pilgrimage in England to which folks went partly for pleasure and partly for piety.
Such were the shrines of Our Lady at Walsingham, Worcester, Doncaster, Penrice, and Ipswich; the Holy Roods of Waltham, Bromholm, and the North Door of S. Paul's; the Holy Blood of Hayles; the resting-places of famous native saints, such as <persName key="Cuthbert">S. Cuthbert</persName> at Durham, S. Edmund at Bury, S. Alban, S. John of Beverley, SS. Etheldreda and
Osyth in East England, S. Edward the Confessor at Westminster, and a host of others, beside the most famous of all,
<quote>"S. Thomas of England."</quote> <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName> has described a pilgrim company of all ranks riding together from  Southwark to

   <p>6. <note place="foot" n="6">Food and raiment in England in the fourteenth century.</note>
The dress of the gentry was perhaps never more costly and curious than at the courts of <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> and <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>   French, Gascon, Spanish,
German, and Bohemian fashions, each had their followers. There was a lavish use of embroidered stuffs, fur, and jewellery. One young knight would wear a square-collared tight-laced tunic of blue or green with scalloped border, and sleeves buttoned from elbow to wrist; his head was wrapped in a gay hood of the same stuff, buttoned and jag-edged also, with a long liripipe or pointed hood-tip; hose of different hues covered the legs, and on the feet were Cracow shoes with long curving tips laced to the knees with silver chains.  Another chose to dress in a German slop or jacket, or a Spanish paltock, which was a short sleeveless vest laced to the hose by dozens of silk strings. This man would wear over his tunic the French <quote>cote-hardie</quote>, a fur-lined, fur-trimmed kirtle without sleeves to show the costly buttons of the tunic beneath it; that one held to his English coat with hanging half-sleeves;



<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>

 a third would appear in a Bohemian gown with ample skirt and huge poke-sleeves, while his hood was twisted into a graceful cap with a jewelled brooch fastened above the forehead, and a long lappet hanging on the left side of the face as far as the collar.  A fourth would use a furred
Russian cap as head-gear, and a long Gascon mantle, buttoned on the right shoulder, for a cloak. Riding-boots of Cordova or morocco leather reaching to mid-thigh, and broad riding-hats set with jewels or small feathered caps were worn on horseback; and all spurs were now rowelled.
The great ladies copied the fashions of their lords, and took special pleasure in the ermine-edged and jewel-clasped cote-hardie, and over it the deep-furred mantle with silver clasps and silken neck-cords; their kirtles, like the men's, were of indigo blue, <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> green, or scarlet cloth, square-collared, tight-fitting, bejagged, and fastened with rows of little buttons. The matron's head-dress was a kerchief of fine lawn or cambric or coloured silk draped over the hair, which was gathered up into bosses standing out from the head at either temple, and kept in place by a net of gold or silver wire. unwedded ladies wore a ribbon of silk instead of the kerchief.
Both men and women often wore costly chaplets, strings of pearls or jewels or carved beads, or wreaths of twisted ribbons. Women's shoes were of stamped leather or embroidered stuff; a jewelled girdle with a long hanging end was worn about the waist of the kirtle, and showed through the side-openings of the cote-hardie. Both ladies and gentlemen wore broad collars of silver and gold, such as only mayors and ushers bear nowadays. The very harness of the horses was most richly adorned.    Queen Ann is said to have brought in a kind of side-saddle from Bohemia which became the fashion for great ladies, but most gentlewomen still rode in the old fashion. The ballad thus describes a queen's riding-gear:-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Her saddle was of the rowel bone [ivory inlaid], seemly sight it was
   to see,</l>
<l>Thickly set with precious stones, and compassed [trimmed] all with
   broidery;</l>
<l>Her girths of noble silk they were, the buckles all of beryl-stone;</l>
<l>The stirrups were of crystal clear, and all with pearl-work overdone;</l>
<l>The poitral was of pall [velvet] so fine ; the crupper was of orfary
[gold-broidered stuff];</l>
<l>The bridle was of golden twine; with silver bells on each side three."</l></quote>
The ordinary dress of middle-class folk was of course not so fine as those above described. The women wore clothes



<pb id="p.277" n="277"/>

 cut much as nuns' are now, but of gay colours.     The men usually wore hood, tunic, and hose, but when fully dressed put on over these a long buttoned cloth gown of the colour of their livery or guild, with bagged or tight sleeves, girt with a plain leathern girdle. A serjeant-at-law or a judge wore a gown of parti-coloured stuff, belted with a striped silk sash, fur cape, and white silk coif [skull-cap].  The hair and beard were worn long, in the old English fashion.</p>
  <p>It was not only in dress that the costly habits of the richer classes were shown, but also in the grand banquets, with their varied viands, foreign wines, and gorgeous services of plate, at which whole days would be passed.  A court poet thus tells of such a feast :-
     <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"There came in at the first course, before the king's self,</l>
<l>       Boars' heads on broad dishes of burnished silver,</l>
<l>       Flesh of fat harts with noble furmenty,</l>
<l>       And peacocks and plovers on platters of gold,</l>
<l>       Herons and swans in chargers of silver,</l>
<l>       And tarts of Turkey full pleasant to taste.</l>
<l>       Next hams of wild-boar with brawn beglazed,</l>
<l>       Barnacle-geese and bitterns in embossed dishes,</l>
<l>       Venison in pasties, so comely to view,</l>
<l>       Jellies that glittered and gladdened the eye.</l>
<l>       Then cranes and curlews craftily roasted,</l>
<l>       Conies in clear sauce coloured so bright,</l>
<l>       Pheasants in their feathers on the flashing silver,</l>
<l>       With gay galantines and dainties galore.</l>
<l>       There were claret and Crete wine in clear silver fountains,</l>
<l>       Wine of Alsace and Antioch and Hippocras enough,</l>
<l>       Vernaccia from Venice, a wine of great virtue,</l>
<l>       Rhenish wine and Rochelle, and wine from Mount Rose,</l>
<l>       All in flagons of fine gold, and on the fair cupboard</l>
<l>       Stood store of gilt goblets glorious of hue,</l>
<l>       Sixty of one set with jewels on their sides."</l></quote>
When the banquet was over the guests wash their hands in rosewater, and go forth two and two to the chamber or parlour, where
     <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Spices [dessert] were dispensed with unsparing hand,</l>
<l>       And Malmsey and Muscatel, those marvellous drinks,</l>
<l>       Went readily round in fair russet cups."</l></quote>
We may compare all this good cheer and fine raiment with the poor ploughman's fare and clothing.</p>

  Just as in Italy the Tuscan was chosen among the other dialects to become the tongue of Italy, so in
England it was now that choice was made of one speech which should henceforward become the English tongue.   The Southern dialect was set aside;



<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>

 men had almost ceased to write in it, and it was spoken in the most out-of-the-way and least central counties. The
Northern dialect became the tongue of the Scottish court, in which Scottish poets and prose-writers wrote and talked down to the eighteenth century; but south of Tweed it was the
Midland dialect, which became the King's English, and fathered our spoken and written English of to-day. It is not hard to see why this was, it was the dialect most easily understood by those who spoke the other two; it was spoken at both the universities and at the court (which usually lay in the midlands), hence those who wrote it could count upon the richest and most numerous readers, so that writers were drawn to use it, and songs and dancing ballads and tales were chiefly composed in it, and it became the tongue of the government. Moreover, such great authors as
William of Langland, <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>, and <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>, who used it, set a pattern which lesser men naturally followed. For instance, when King James of Scotland wished to write verses he chose to take <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>, "the lodestar of our language," as his model rather than the less famous poets of his own northern speech. Samples of Midland English of the fourteenth century are-

<p>The sounds and grammar of Midland English changed little during this hundred years, but its store of words was largely new; numbers of English words which had been replaced by French and other foreign words now dropped out altogether, and in William of Langland or <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>'s works one finds not more than six or seven words in a hundred which cannot now be understood.    The chief difference, indeed, between the <hi rend="italics">Northern and Midland English</hi>, beside pronunciation, lies in the far greater number of old English and Danish words kept by the former, as even at this day may be seen from  a glance at the pages of Burns or other modern Scottish poets.

  <p>8. <note place="foot" n="8">English literature in the fourteenth century. <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>, <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>,
Langland, Eglintoun, <persName key="Froissart, John">Froissart</persName>.</note>Ever since the Conquest gentlefolk had read and written
French, and what English books had been written were written for the middle and poorer classes. However, now that the lords and gentry no longer held estates in France, but were born and bred in England, though they still understood and spoke French, they began to find it easier to read their favourite poems and tales in English than in French.
Writers, therefore, set themselves to English the most famous
French and Latin books for their use. At the end of the thirteenth century, Robert of Gloucester was, as we have seen, making his charming <quote>"Chronicle of England"</quote> and the <quote>" Saints'
Lives"</quote> in English rhyme. Among his fellow-authors were the writer of the popular <quote>" Cursor Mundi,"</quote> a huge rhyming
Scripture history, and Robert Manning, a canon and priest of
Bourne, who not only Englished Peter of Langtoft's French
<quote>"Chronicle of <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName>," </quote>but also William of Wadington's
<quote>Manuel des Peches,"</quote> which he called <quote>" Handling Sin,"</quote> and
Bonaventura's <quote>" Meditations on the Lord's Supper."</quote>  Nor is
<persName key="Rolle, Richard">Richard Rolle</persName>, the hermit of Hampole, to be forgotten, the author of one version of the widely-read <quote>"Stimulus Conscientie,"</quote>
 of which there was also a south English translation. All these religious books found eager readers among both parish priests, and monks, and pious laymen. Nor was there any lack of lighter reading.  William, a man from the
Severn valley, did the poem of <quote>"William of Palermo"</quote> into
English alliterative (letter-stressed) metre for Humfrey of
Bohun, Earl of Hereford, about <date value ="1350">1350</date>, and the Romances of
Alexander, Vespasian, and the Knight of the Swan were also Englished in the same way about the same time.
  At the Scottish court of David were two <quote>"gude makaris,"</quote>
Sir Hugh of Eglintoun, <date value ="1320">1320</date>-1381  (judge of the Royal
Court and husband of Gill, half-sister of Robert II.), and
Clerk of Tranent, about <date value ="1375">1375</date>. Sir Hugh used the old verse for his <quote>" Morte Arthur,'</quote> <quote>" Troy-Book,"</quote> and <quote>"Bible Stories,"</quote> but added rhyme and stanza-form to letter-stress in the
<quote>"Pearl,"</quote> <quote>"Susanna,"</quote> and the <quote>"Adventure of Gawayn."</quote> It was this kind of verse that Clerk chose for his poems on


<pb id="p.281" n="281"/>


Gawayn. These two men were not mere translators, they took old stories and gave them fresh life and beauty. Another Scot of letters was <hi rend="italics">John Barbour</hi>, Archdeacon of
Aberdeen, who wrote a rhyming <quote>"Troy-Book,"</quote> Saints' Lives, and an oft-quoted poem, <quote>" The Brus," </quote>which has never been forgotten in Scotland. A fourth northern author, who made a fine rhyming poem on Sir Tristram, was followed by a shoal of copiers, who turned most of the French tales of <quote>" Knights
Adventurous "</quote> and the Latin <quote>" Saints' Lives "</quote> into what was often mere clinking doggrel, of the kind <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName> mocks in
<quote>Sir Topaz."</quote> The earlier and better of these rhymed gestes are by Northerners, the later and worse by Midland men.</p>
  <p>The fourteenth century also gives birth to the English and
Scottish ballad, the most beautiful of all modern popular poetry. The metre was that of the earlier French dancing songs (the later French ballad is wholly of another kind); and our oldest ballads were made for singing to the round dance, with burdens or choruses in which all the company joined. The first Robin Hood ballad (<quote>"Robin and Wrennock"</quote>) is as early as <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>, as is the first border ballad (<quote>" Thomas of Ercildoun"</quote>); the first historical ballad
(<quote>"Otterburn Fray"</quote>) is of <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>'s time. In <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>'s days, the war-songs of Lawrence Minot, in French rhyme, must not be left out; and <persName key="Froissart, John">Froissart</persName> the chronicler and other French poets wrote love poems for <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>
There are hundreds of songs and carols of the like kind by unknown English poets of this and the following reigns.</p>
  <p>We have seen how great was the power of <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName> and his disciples on English thought, it was even greater on the
English tongue, for they certainly gave a start to English prose-writing. The famous French allegory the <quote>" Romance of the Rose,"</quote> by William Lorris, and John Clopinel of
Meung, with its humour, satire, and thoughtfulness, no doubt had some weight with our William of Langland, though both in matter, verse, and plot he is thoroughly English, and uses the popular love of allegory which the French poets had fostered, for his own aims and in his own way.
He, like them, had many followers, mostly among the earnest Lollards, to whom we owe the <quote>"Plowman's Creed,"</quote>
<quote>"Jack Upland,"</quote> and the like.</p>
  <p>But by far the foremost figure among English writers of this day is <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Geoffrey Chaucer</persName>. Born about <date value ="1340">1340</date>, the son of a merchant vintner in <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> Street, London, he passed his youth in the household of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, and after his death became a follower of <persName key="Gaunt, John">John of Gaunt</persName>, in whose service


<pb id="p.282" n="282"/>

 and King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s he spent nearly all his life. He fought in France in his youth, and was prisoner there from
<date value ="1359">1359</date> to <date value ="1360">1360</date>.  In his manhood he was often abroad in
France and Italy on embassies, <dateRange from="1372" to="1384">1372-1384</dateRange>, from <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> or <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName> He also served the king as Comptroller of the Customs, <dateRange from="1374" to="1382">1374-1382</dateRange>, and Clerk of the Works, <dateRange from="1389" to="1391">1389-1391</dateRange>, and he sat as knight of the shire for <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> in the Parliament of <date value="1386">1386</date>. On coming to the throne <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry IV.</persName> gave him a pension, but he died the same year in a house close to the
Abbey of Westminster, where his body now lies entombed.
He was a friend of the French poet Eustace des Champs
(whose uncle Machault's metre he often used) and of Otho
Graunson, <quote>"the flower of them that make [write poetry] in
France,"</quote> and in Italy he may have met Petrarca and Boccaccio, whose works he admired and copied. From the Italians he learned to write in a smooth and natural style; but he had gifts of his own which lifted him above his masters, sound common-sense, delightful mirth, and kindliness of soul, and from them he gained his keen, quick insight into truths which were dim or wholly dark to most men of his day. So that though he was court poet, a gentleman writing for the pleasure of lords and ladies, not caring to teach any new thing or wishing for any sudden changes, his work is truthful, natural, and lasting, and he has left us not only the best picture of his own age, but perhaps the deepest views of men's hearts and thoughts yet set down on paper in England.
His first works were copies of the French poems of the day, he also translated Boccaccio's <quote>"Filostrato,"</quote> paraphrased
Boethius' <quote>"Comfort of Wisdom "</quote> (King <persName key="AElfred">Alfred</persName>'s old favourite), and made a <quote>" Book on the Astrolabe "</quote> for his son Lewis. But the <quote>" <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> Tales"</quote> is his best work-a great undertaking of which not a quarter was finished, but which is none the less the most perfect piece of writing any Englishman before the Reformation ever penned, and fully justifies the honour in which later English poets have held its author. Already in his own day <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName> had many friends and admirers, chief of whom was <persName key="Gower, John">John Gower</persName>, <dateRange from="1330" to="1402">1330-1402</dateRange>, a favourite poet of
<persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>, for whom he made his <quote>"Lover's Confession,"</quote> a long medley of moral tales somewhat after Robert of Bourne's model. <persName key="Gower, John">Gower</persName> also wrote the <quote>"Thinker's Looking-Glass "</quote> in
French, but his best poem, a thoughtful satire called the
<quote>"Voice of One Crying,"</quote> is in Latin.</p>
  <p>In history the Latin chroniclers are still our chief guides.
John of Trokelowe (<dateRange from="1307" to="1323">1307-1323</dateRange>) and the painstaking Thomas
Walsingham (<dateRange from="1377" to="1392">1377-1392</dateRange>) keep up the credit of S. Albans.

France, give it much value. But it is perhaps in his book that one can most plainly see the selfish disregard of the poor, and the wanton pride, and lust, and haste to shed blood, which were so soon to bring ruin upon the nobles, who gave way to them,-a ruin that happily cleared the path for men with higher aims than their own present pleasures.

  THE new king was crowned with great pomp 13th
October <date value ="1399">1399</date>. Forty-six young squires were made Knights of the Bath, and walked to church with green silken shoulder-knots on their mantles. Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, who had married <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s half-sister, Joan Beaufort, was made Marshal; <persName key="Percy, Henry">Henry Percy</persName>, the Earl of Northum- ` berland, was made Constable and Lord of Man; his son
Harry, Lord of Anglesey and Lieutenant of North Wales; and his brother Thomas, Earl of Worcester, named Admiral and Lieutenant of South Wales. Arundel was again acknowledged as archbishop. Parliament met on the 15th, and ordered the Acts of last Parliament to be cancelled, and those of <date value ="1388">1388</date> restored; the blank charters were to be destroyed.  <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>, the king's son, was made Prince of
Wales, Duke of Cornwall, and Earl of Chester, and the king promised that the power of the Estates should not again be given to a small Board. On the 16th, Sir William
Bagot, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s former minister, charged Aumale with the murder of Gloucester. But Aumale, <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName>, and <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> challenged him to wager of battle. All the parties were arrested. On the 23d, the Lords condemned
King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> to perpetual prison, the Commons saying that they would not be parties to any judgments given in parliament. On the 3d November, those of the appellants of <date value ="1397">1397</date> who were still alive were judged:

 remain Earls of Rutland, <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, and Huntingdon; Marquis Dorset and the Earl of Gloucester to come back to their old titles of Earl of Somerset and Lord Despenser; the Earl of Salisbury was to prove his guiltlessness by battle with Lord Morley, his challenger. Later, the Earls of Suffolk, Arundel, and Warwick were restored to their former rights, and the earldoms of Aquitaine and Lancaster given to the Prince of Wales. Yet the outlook was not very bright. Many in England disliked or feared <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>.
France, and Scotland, and Flanders were openly unfriendly to him, and Wales staunch to <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>. The king's help came chiefly from Arundel (who led the stronger half of the
English Church) and those great northern barons to whom he was largely beholden for his crown. His aims were peace and cheap government at home, the reconquest of his heritage abroad, and the upholding of the Church by the crushing of heresy. But he was not able to carry out one of these plans fully, for he could never gain the love of his people, his nobles would only help him for their own ends, and he was so crippled all his life for want of money that the pay of Calais garrison was left years in arrear, and the wages of his ambassadors abroad were only doled out to them when they threatened to throw up their thankless task.
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> had, moreover, to face the danger which every
English king, for more than a hundred years after <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s dethronement had to meet-the bitter and relentless feud which rent the royal house, and destroyed nearly all the descendants of <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>, only ceasing for a while during a cruel and unprofitable foreign war.</p>

The first plot of the many which mark this reign was planned early in <date value ="1400">1400</date> by the Earls of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, Huntingdon, and Salisbury, and Lord Despenser at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>. Under colour of holding a tournament, they were to gather at
Windsor on Twelfth Night, seize and put to death the king and his sons, and put back King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>. But Rutland, whose share in the plot was discovered by his father, rode in haste to tell <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> all, and so save himself.
The king at once stole off to the Tower to gather troops.
The earls, disappointed of their prey, went past Windsor to
Sunning, where Isabel, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s young queen, was living.
Here <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, putting a good face on the matter, boasted that
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, for all his soldiership and renown, had fled before them, and declaring that <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> had escaped from prison, and was waiting at Radcot Bridge with 100,000 men ready to win back his own, called upon true men to follow him.

He then tore off the collars of gold <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> had given to some of those present, and made the yeomen cast under foot the silver crescent badge of Lancaster. With a small following,
<placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> and Salisbury rode on to Cirencester, but there being attacked by the townsfolk who favoured <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, were obliged to give themselves up. Next day a priest of their train secretly set fire to certain thatched houses in the town, hoping that in the turmoil his masters the earls might get away.
<note place="foot" n="2">Huntingdon's plot and <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s death <date value ="1400">1400</date>.</note>
But the townsfolk were so angry at this breach of faith, that they haled the prisoners out of the Abbey, where they lay, and cut off their heads forthwith, before they went back to put out the fire. Huntingdon had gone to Essex to take ship, to seek help from <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s French friends, but he was stopped by contrary winds, made prisoner by the levy of Essex, and taken to Plashy, the house of Joan of
Arundel, Countess of Hereford, <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s mother-in-law.
Joan would have saved him, but the young Earl of Arundel met him. <q type="spoken">"You made me your foot-boy when you were a great man at <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s court, but I will have my revenge now."</q> And he bade the Essex yeomen slay him. Huntingdon pleaded hard for his life. <q type="spoken">" I never hurt any one of you in my life !"</q> and none of them would lift hand against him.  Then Arundel bade a squire of his own kill him.
<q type="spoken">"Here are 8000 men,"</q> said Huntingdon, <q type="spoken">"and art thou the only one cruel enough to kill me. Alas! if 'I had only gone to Rome when the Pope bade me be his marshal, I should not stand in peril to-day !"</q> But Arundel's threats frightened the squire, and he butchered the prisoner on the very spot where Gloucester had been arrested by King
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>. The <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName> townsfolk beheaded Despenser (with whose house they had a standing feud), and sent his head by Rutland to London, though the king had ordered that he should be spared to speak with him. Others were tried, and put to death at London and <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>. The poor plan of this rising, and the ill-feeling of the people of the south of
England towards the young courtiers of <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, had more to do with its failure than a love for <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>. The king thanked the Londoners for their readiness in arming for him, promised the men and women of Cirencester two butts of wine and ten fallow deer every year in return for their zeal, and threatened that he would uproot traitors like evil weeds from his garden, and plant in their stead good and wholesome herbs.  A few days after this, it was made known that <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> was dead at Pomfret, whither he had



<pb id="p.289" n="289"/>

 been taken from the Tower 29th October <date value ="1399">1399</date>. His body was shown at Cheapside, with bared face, for two hours to the people. Whether he died of grief (as did the banished
Norfolk at Venice when he heard the news of <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s fall and <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s success), or whether, like <persName key="Edward II.">Edward II.</persName>, he was secretly murdered, as most men believed, is not known for certain. Some even held that the body shown was that of one Maudlin the chaplain, who was very like <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, and that <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> had really broken out of Pomfret, and, when the rising failed, fled to Scotland, mad with the disappointment. And it is true that a madman was long kept at the
Scottish Court, and cared for as King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, though
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> maintained that he was only a runaway priest called
Thomas Ward of Trumpington.</p>

  King <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles</persName> of France was shocked at the death of his friend and son-in-law, and feared <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> as a claimant to the French crown; he therefore asked for the little Isabel to be sent back to France with her dower. For some time
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> would not let her go, wishing to marry her to his son, the Prince of Wales; but <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles</persName> would hear of no match till she was back to France ; so she was returned safely, though her dower was kept as part payment for the ransom of King John, which had never been received in full. <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles</persName> suffered from disease of the brain, which made him helpless for months together; and while he was ill, his brother Louis,
Duke of Orleans, and his cousin John, Duke of Burgundy, quarrelled for power. Duke Louis had made a bond of friendship with <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> while they were together in Paris, but he now tore it up, and twice challenged his old friend to wager of battle, accusing him of <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s murder. <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> refused to fight, but denied the charge by oath. Waleran,
Earl of St. Pol, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s brother-in-law, also declared war against <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, and hanged a figure, made to be like Rutland, upon a gibbet by Calais gate, to show his hate of the traitor.
So, though there was no open war with France, he and other
French nobles fitted up fleets of privateers and began to plunder English ships, and made raids on the English coast, year after year, causing much annoyance and damage.</p>
  <p>In order to strengthen himself against his foes in France,
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> took care to keep friendly with Portugal and Castile, of which lands his sisters were queens. Moreover, he gave one of his daughters, Blanche, in marriage to Louis, son of Rupert, king of the Romans, and the other, Philippa, with a great portion, to Eric XIII. of Denmark. He himself

  <p>Both <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> and the archbishop disliked and feared the

And when Parliament was called in <date value ="1401">1401</date>, Arundel and his friends got the Commons to petition <quote>" that when any man or woman, of whatever estate or rank, was taken or imprisoned for Lollery, such an one should be at once put to plead, and have judgment as he deserved, for an ensample to others of such evil following to quickly cease from their evil preaching, and keep to the Christian faith."</quote> And it was made law (a) that every one found guilty of heresy in the bishop's court, and persisting therein, should be given over to the sheriff to be burnt on a high place before the people;

  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="4">Sir <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain of Glyndwr</persName>, Prince of Wales, <date value ="1402">1402</date>.</note>
  Wales had never agreed to the unkinging of <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, and ere long the most part of that country was in open revolt against <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, who could never, as long as he lived, get his title acknowledged there. The Welsh war was begun by a knight of Mid-Wales, named <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain of Glyndwrdy</persName> or
Glyndwr. He was born in <date value ="1364">1364</date>, brought up at one of the
English Inns of Court, and served as squire to the late Earl of
Arundel, and as it is said afterwards to King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, who knighted him in <date value ="1387">1387</date>. When his master was arrested at
Flint, Sir <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName> went home to his Welsh estates. Near him dwelt Lord Grey of Rufhin, a Lancastrian partisan, from whom he had once won certain lands by a lawsuit.
Lord Grey now, by force of arms, took back these lands, insulting <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName>'s daughter to boot. Sir <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName> complained to the House of Lords, but they would not listen to <quote>"bare-footed Welsh buffoons,"</quote> and gave Grey more of the plaintiff's lands. Whereupon <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName> took the law into his own hands, and, being desperate, resolved to rouse his countrymen by setting up his standard as Prince of Wales, calling upon all good Welshmen to gather to him, and fight for their own prince and the true
King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> against the traitor <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> and the false prince, his son. Welsh knights and squires who had once followed
<placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, and knew <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName>'s wisdom and bravery, soon joined him, Welsh scholars hurried away from London and
<placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> to fight in his service, and the country-folk of North and Mid-Wales flocked to his host. On September 30,
<date value ="1400">1400</date>, he broke into Ruthin at fair-time, and burnt it;



<pb id="p.291" n="291"/>
<note type="header"  place="head"><date value="1402">1402.]</date></note>
 later on he made a raid to Oswestry, and burnt that town also. The strong castles of Hawarden, Flint, Conway, and
Radnor, he took and held, thus making himself master of all North Wales. He took prisoner his foe, Lord Grey, on the Virnwy, and Sir Edmund Mortimer, uncle to the young
Earl of March, at Brynglas.  He burnt the minsters of
St. Asaph, Llandaff, Bangor, and Cwmhir, putting Welsh clergy in place of the Lancastrian priests he drove out.
In <date value ="1402">1402</date> he was crowned Prince of Wales at Machynlledd.
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> and his son marched against him in vain; they were beaten back by the bad weather before they could force
<persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName> to a battle. Nor could the jealous hate of some of his own countrymen harm him. His brother-in-law, David, son of <persName key="Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap">Llewelyn</persName>, surnamed Gam [crooked eye], plotted to kill him, but was found out and put in prison. And Hoel
Sele of Nannau, who basely shot at him while they were hunting together, was slain on the spot. These successes and escapes were put down by the English to witchcraft, and great fear fell on <persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName>'s foes. <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> tried to keep the war to Wales by laws forbidding Welshmen, or Englishmen married to Welsh women, from holding lands or office in any part of England or in the English boroughs of Wales.</p>
  <p>5. As to Ireland, which <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName> had not had time to pacify, the greater part of the English Pale was in the hands of the Irish chiefs and the old settler families of
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>'s day. Only the towns were under royal government. The king was anxious to keep the country as quiet as he could, as he had little money to spare in case of war or rebellion. He therefore sent his second son, Thomas, over as his lieutenant, with a yearly grant. He brought in fresh settlers from England, got back much of the crown land that had fallen into the nobles' hands, encouraged the citizens of Dublin to use their ships against the Welsh and
Scots sea-rovers, who were in league with the Irish clans.
But all was of little use, the Geraldines and Butlers were stronger than the Lieutenant, and throughout this reign there are constant complaints from the Pale of the bad, weak, and starved government of Ireland.</p>
  <p>Scotland was a greater danger to <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>.  Its king,
Robert III., was weak of mind, and all power was in the hands of his eldest son, David, Earl of Rothesay, and his brother, Robert, Earl of Albany, who were bad friends.
When homage was refused, <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> marched into Scotland, but though Rothesay challenged him to single combat, neither he nor Albany, the regent, would risk a pitched



<pb id="p.292" n="292"/>

 battle; so <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, who carefully refrained from rousing the
Scots by burning or plundering their land, was soon starved back into England.
<note place="foot" n="5">Troubles with the Irish and Scots.</note>The Earl of Northumberland and his son Harry, whom the Scots called
<persName key="Percy II, Henry">Hotspur</persName>, were left Wardens of the East and West Marches.
They were helped there by George Dunbar, Earl of March, who, in anger at Rothesay not marrying his daughter, as he had promised, came over to the English court, and was taken into <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s service, with a yearly pension of 500 marks. However, Albany made himself sole ruler in April
<date value ="1401">1401</date>, by putting Rothesay to death, and it was bruited about in <date value ="1402">1402</date> that he was to lead an army into England, to put back King <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, whom he declared to have escaped to Scotland. For spreading this news and forwarding this enterprise, Sir Roger Clarendon, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s chamberlain
Serle, and a number of Grey Brothers were afterwards punished as traitors in England. However, in July the
Scots really came. March had defeated a body of Scottish raiders at <hi rend="italics">Nesbit Moor</hi>, killing their leader, Hepburn of
Hales. Douglas, March's old foe, thereupon asked Albany to send him with a large force into England. They reached the Tyne, when March and the Percies got behind them, and cut off their retreat at Homildon Hill, September 14, <date value ="1402">1402</date>.
On that day Otterburn was avenged, for the English archers galled their foes sorely, and when the Scottish knights charged, poured such thick volleys into them that they turned and fled, many being drowned in the Tweed, as they tried to cross it in their flight. So the day was won by the long-bow alone, no Englishman having drawn his sword.
The Earls of Douglas, Angus, Moray, and Orkney were taken prisoners; but the best prizes were held to be Murdac,
Earl of Fife, Albany's eldest son, and Robert Logan the privateer, who had sworn to sweep English fishermen and merchants from the North Sea.</p>
  <p>6. Yet this victory well-nigh proved <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s overthrow.
The Percies got but little thanks for their deeds, while the
 &#x00A3; 2000 they spent in the king's service was but slowly repaid; and though <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> ransomed Lord Grey from
<persName key="Glyndwr, Owain">Owain</persName>, he would not purchase the freedom of <persName key="Percy II, Henry">Hotspur</persName>'s brother-in-law, Sir Edmund Mortimer. In their anger they sent secretly to treat with the cunning Welsh prince. He readily listened to them, set Mortimer free, and married him to his own daughter. The Percies, on their side, forgave Douglas his ransom, on his promise to join them with a band of Scottish knights. Help was sent for from France.

Many northern lords favoured the plotters, who were to crown the true heir, <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, or, if he were really dead, the young Earl of March. Pretending that they had settled to fight a pitched battle with the Scots on the 1st August, the
Percies boldly sent to <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> for men and money, whereon he promised to join them himself, with George of Dunbar and other brave knights. When he reached Burton-on-Trent, he heard that <persName key="Percy II, Henry">Hotspur</persName> and Douglas had made friends with Glyndwr, and raised <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>'s standard in the west.
Calling out the levies of the shires, <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> turned, and threw himself into Shrewsbury. The earls now defied him, as false and forsworn, for dethroning and murdering his king, and keeping the crown from the heir, for packing parliaments, for raising income-taxes against law, for ill-treating his nobles.   <note place="foot" n="6">The Battle of Shrewsbury, July 23,<date value ="1403">1403</date>.</note>
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> sent the Abbot of Shrewsbury to offer the Percies terms, but
Thomas of Worcester played the traitor, and altered the words of the offer, so that <persName key="Percy II, Henry">Hotspur</persName> refused it. The king had chosen his place of battle well, and a field of beans, with knotted stems, covered part of his array. He did not stay by his banner himself, nor wear his own coat of arms, by the advice of Dunbar, who warned him that the earls would chiefly seek to kill or take him, and that if this attack failed, he must win the day. In a headlong charge
<persName key="Percy II, Henry">Hotspur</persName> and Douglas reached the royal standard, seeking their foe in vain. But as they fought their way back, ringed round by the king's men, <persName key="Percy II, Henry">Hotspur</persName> was shot dead by an arrow, and Douglas fell badly hurt. The shouts of <q type="spoken">"Harry
<persName key="Percy II, Henry">Percy</persName> king !"</q> were now drowned by the Lancastrian cries of <q type="spoken">"Percy dead ! Percy dead !" </q>and the earl's troops turned and fled, save the Cheshire men, who stood till they were nearly all slain. The traitor Thomas was soon after taken, and beheaded, with other rebel barons. When Northumberland, who was hurrying south to join his son, heard of his death, and found that his shrewd brother-in-law, Ralf,
Earl of Westmoreland, was in arms for <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> and barring his road, he laid down his arms and went to beg the king's forgiveness at <placeName key="York">York</placeName>. <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> wisely listened to his excuses, and promised him <quote>" that he should not go graceless."</quote></p>
  <p><persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> had too little money to follow up his victory by falling upon Glyndwr, and when at the Parliament of
January <date value ="1404">1404</date> he called for supplies to meet an attack from abroad, the Commons said he had enough revenue, were it but well spent.  So in order to get help, <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> had to give way to all their wishes  A  privy council of

</note> twenty-one was appointed by their approval, the king's confessor and others were dismissed, with all the aliens at court (save a few personal servants of the new queen, Joan of Navarre), an ordinance was made for the rule of the royal household, and  &#x00A3;12,100 set apart to maintain it. This done, they granted a shilling on every pound's worth of land in
England, to be spent only by the advice of four Treasurers of War named by themselves. The crown was settled on the Prince of Wales and his heirs, and after them, to his brothers, one by one, in order. <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> was tried by the Peers, found guilty of trespass, and pardoned. Still the king needed money, and in October <date value ="1404">1404</date> the Lay or
Unlearned Parliament was called by writs, forbidding lawyers to be chosen members thereof, for it was thought that they wasted time in <quote>"upholding points at law, and other private business."</quote> The Commons gave large taxes, and proposed that the king should take one year's income of the clergy for his wars. But the angry bishops declaring that this would be a breach of the Great Charter, it was settled that all pensions and grants of crown land since <date value ="1367">1367</date> should be looked into, and enough taken back to enable the king <quote>" to live on his own."</quote></p>
  <p>7. In <date value ="1405">1405</date>, James, the young heir of Scotland, was taken off Flamboro' Head, as he was on his way to the French court. <q type="spoken">" If these Scots had been kindly, they would have sent the boy to me,"</q> said <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, <q type="spoken">" for I know French well enough to teach him,"</q> and he put him in safe keeping with careful masters. Next year, when King Robert died, <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> found the worth of the hostage he held; for Albany, the regent, who loved to rule, saw that it would be wiser not to cause <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> to send back the heir, and thus the English king was rid of one danger.</p>
  <p>But the northern lords were not yet sure that they might not get their will by force, and made a fresh revolt.
The Lady Despenser tried to carry off young March and his brother to Wales, but they were retaken on the way, whereupon she accused the Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, her brother, and
Thomas Mowbray, the earl marshal, son of <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s old foe, of a plot against the king's life. They were imprisoned, but soon pardoned; and then Mowbray went off to Northumberland, who, with the Archbishop of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and other northern lords, now took up arms. As <hi rend="italics">proctors [or agents] for the commonwealth of England</hi>, they asked for a free

Westmoreland, with Thomas Beaufort and John the king's son, went to meet the " reformers," and after defeating them, brought about a parley with the leaders, Lord Scrope and Mowbray, near Shipton, promising to lay their complaints before the king. <note place="foot" n="7">The end of <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s English enemies, <dateRange from="1404" to="1408">1404-8</dateRange>.</note>
On this the northern army went home; but Westmoreland arrested the archbishop and the marshal, who were brought to trial as traitors. Sir
William Gascoyne, the chief-justice, refused to sentence them, because he thought they ought to have been tried before their peers; but Sir William Fulthorpe and another judge gave judgment against them, and they were beheaded on the 8th June. When they were led out to death in a field of green barley, poor Mowbray's heart failed him, but the archbishop bade him be of good cheer, and met his end so meekly and piously that many men held him for a martyr, and made pilgrimages to his tomb. Archbishop
Arundel spoke warmly against the judgment, but John and
Thomas Beaufort would not hear of mercy, and told <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> that he must no longer spare his foes. <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> and Lord Bardolf fled to Scotland, and lay there for two years, till, fearing Albany might yield them up, they hardened their hearts in <date value ="1407">1407</date> to make another attack on

Moor, with deadly success. <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> was killed,
Bardolf wounded to death, and their friend, the Abbot of

  <p>8. Meanwhile the king had been, year by year, forced by his needs to give way to the just claims of the two Houses of Parliament. In <date value ="1406">1406</date>, the Speaker claimed of the Crown
<quote>"good and abundant governance,"</quote> and advised that the

Commons claimed to have the royal accounts audited, and got the king to name a fresh privy council of seventeen, whom they compelled to swear to a set of thirty-one articles, fixing their powers and duties.

  <q type="spoken">"Death! death !"</q> One sharp blow cut off his left hand.
  <q type="spoken">" I am Louis of Orleans,"</q> he cried, <q type="spoken">" what would ye do ?"</q>
 <q type="spoken">" We do that for which we came!'</q>; they answered, and
  stabbed him again and again as he lay helpless on the
  ground, killing also the faithful German squire who tried to cover him from their weapons. Then John of Burgundy,
  who had stood by, stepped forward, and, looking carefully at
  his dead cousin's face by the light of a link, cried, <q type="spoken">" Yes, it is
  he, sure enough,"</q> and, leaving the corpses there in the
  kennel, hurried off with his men. When the news of the
  murder got about, the proofs were strong against John, who
  at first denied it, but afterwards, when he was in safety,
  dared to boast of the deed as the lawful taking-off of a
  tyrant. Orleans' party (called Armagnacs, because the Earl
  of Armagnac, father-in-law of Duke Charles, Louis' son, was
  their leader for the time) resolved upon revenge, and open
  civil war broke out in France. Burgundy, in <date value ="1411">1411</date>, begged
  help from England, and the Prince of Wales, who disliked
  the house of Orleans, sent the Earl of Arundel and Kyme
  and Sir <persName key="Oldcastle, John">John Oldcastle</persName> to help him.   They beat the

John to take Paris before they came home. The defeat of
Glyndwr's great raid in <date value ="1409">1409</date>, and the execution of its leaders, Rhys ddu and Philpot Scudamour, led to the submission of most of Mid-Wales. The Lollards now began to stir in England again; a scheme was brought forward by the Commons to take a third of the Church lands, &#x00A3;110,000, for keeping a regular standing army, and another third for the king's other needs, leaving a third to the clergy, besides the lands of the friars, cathedrals and colleges. However, the prince would not hear of this, though he withstood
Arundel's attempt to force Courtenay, the chancellor of the university of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, into severities against the Lollards.</p>
  <p>9. In <date value ="1411">1411</date> the king grew better, and in his anger at the
Beauforts, who had moved him to give up his crown to the
Prince of Wales, turned them out of office to make way for his second son, Thomas (whom  he made Duke of
Clarence), and Archbishop Arundel. Clarence heard that the French princes were likely to make up their quarrel for a time, so he offered help to Orleans, and led an army into
Normandy in <date value ="1412">1412</date>. <note place="foot" n="10"><persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>'s death and character. </note>
But after laying waste that dukedom, and Maine and Anjou, he was bought off and marched into
Guienne. Before more was done the king fell ill agaih. After a fit, which seized him while he was praying at S. Edmund's chapel in Westminster, he sank rapidly, and died on March 20, <date value="1413">1413</date>, in the Jerusalem Chamber. His body is buried in <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> minster.
In his last illness his confessor begged him to repent for three great sins-the murder of <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, the execution of the archbishop, and the wrongful seizure of the crown-and the dying king answered him, <q type="spoken">"As for the two first, the pope has absolved me; and for the third, even though I gave up the crown, my sons would not let it go out of the family."</q> It is said that he called the prince to him and warned him that he had won his crown ill, and that he that should wear it must render a strict account therefor. He also spoke of his great desire to go on a crusade, saying that he had laid money aside to take an army to win back the Lord's sepulchre, and thus atone for his sins. <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> was a strong and handsome man, of grave face and staid speech, a trained knight, a persevering and shrewd party leader, yet he found the burden he had taken upon himself almost too heavy for him. He had been bold and ambitious in his youth, but as king he was slow to do anything that might endanger his crown, and took great pains to please those

 upon whose goodwill his power rested, though he was never popular. He had not scrupled to shed blood to gain his own ends, yet he was merciful by nature, and could never altogether shake off the feeling that he had sinned heavily.
The continual resistance he met even in his family aged him before his time, and his mistrust of his own son is but a single proof of his uneasy mind.</p>

  <p>1. On taking up the rule of the nation, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>, who was crowned on Palm Sunday, April 9, <date value ="1413">1413</date>, on a dark, cloudy, wet day, at once showed such zeal and earnestness that those who had looked on him as a selfish, reckless, and quarrelsome young man wondered at his wisdom. On the other hand, those who had hoped that he would dismiss his father's friends and show favour to the Lollards were not well pleased. Henry Beaufort, Bishop of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, the new king's uncle, being made chancellor in Arundel's place, the archbishop busied himself with attacking the Wicliffites.
<note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Oldcastle, John">Oldcastle</persName>'s plot, January <date value ="1414">1414</date>.</note>
He got Convocation to send up to the council the name of
Sir <persName key="Oldcastle, John">John Oldcastle</persName>, Lord Cobham, an old friend and fellow-soldier of <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s, as one that sheltered heretics and spread evil teaching. The king himself spoke with Sir John, but could not get him to change his views, so the summons was issued for his trial. But <persName key="Oldcastle, John">Oldcastle</persName> paid no heed till he was taken by the king's officers and brought before Arundel.
He then defended himself boldly, charging his judges and accusers with sin and crime. But he was sentenced to death, forty days' grace being given him wherein to repent if he would. Within two weeks, however, he broke out of the Tower, and in spite of the curse of the bishops and the high reward set on his head by the king, was kept in safe hiding. And now he and his Lollard friends made a plot to seize <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> at Eltham, and force him to rule as they thought good, but he hurried to
London before they could take him. Their next plan was to call a meeting of all their followers for the 12th January <date value="1414">1414</date>, at St. Giles's Fields. But, on the evening before,
<persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> closed and guarded the gates of London, and rode out



<pb id="p.299" n="299"/>
<note type="header"  place="head"><date value ="1414">1414.</date></note>
 with many knights to stop the gathering. Those already at the tryst were seized or killed, and the other bands taken or driven off as they came up one by one.  <persName key="Oldcastle, John">Oldcastle</persName> took alarm and fled, but his friend, Sir Roger Acton, was tried for treason, found guilty, and put to death with some thirty more. It was said that these men, had they been successful, meant to set right both Church and State, choosing
Captains for each shire to rule them under <persName key="Oldcastle, John">Oldcastle</persName> (who was to be Captain of England), doing away with serfdom, harsh land-laws, and heavy taxes, and taking the estates of the Church for the defence of the realm. Many in south
England still clung to the hope of such changes, so this year the Parliament was held at Leicester, where it was made law-</p>
<p><quote rend="blockquote">(a) That constables and justices should not wait for the bishop's orders, but of their own accord send to the Church courts for trial all whom they believed to be Lollards. (b) That the lands of the alien priories, namely, the estates in England belonging to monasteries over sea, should be in the king's charge for ever, lest English wealth should be used against England. (c) That henceforward no law made on the request of the Commons should be entered on the rolls so as to change its meaning and intent. (d) John and Humfrey, the king's brothers, were made Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester, his cousin <placeName key="Richard II.">Richard</placeName>, Earl of Cambridge, and Thomas Beaufort, his kinsman, confirmed as Earl of Dorset. (e) It was resolved to send and demand the king's rights from France, and, upon refusal, to enforce these rights by arms.</quote></p>

<p>This last step was taken because the king wished to win a principality in France wherein to find help and refuge if he were ever driven from England, and because the nobles were eager for a chance of winning fame and riches, while the merchants looked to the gain that would flow from trade when Normandy and north France were in English hands, and the safety of the sea thereby secured.   Most eager of all were the clergy, who hoped that a war would turn men's minds from the ideas spread by the Lollards.
France was weak at this time.  <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles VI.</persName> was still mad, and therefore helpless to curb the feuds of his selfish kinsmen, who were ruining their country; on one side the dauphin, the Duke of Orleans, and the southern lords; on the other,
John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, who was favoured by
Paris and the great towns. Knowing the danger, the French court offered <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s ambassadors Aquitaine and the hand of the king's daughter Katherine, with a dower of 400,000 nobles. But this was not enough for him. So calling a fresh

Parliament, November <date value ="1414">1414</date>, he got a large grant, and raising all the money he could, made ready for war. Bedford was made Lieutenant of the realm, and the noble houses that had quarrelled with the late king were pacified by the burial of
<persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName> at Westminster, and the promise of giving back to the young earls, March, <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, and Huntingdon, their rank and royal favour. An army was raised by contract, and a navy gathered to ship it over Channel.
Rules were made for the sharing of the booty, and the ransom of the prisoners that might be taken. <note place="foot" n="2">Cambridge's plot, July <date value ="1415">1415</date>. </note>
<persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> went down to Portsmouth to embark, when a plot formed against him by the Earl of Cambridge was revealed to him by that earl's brother-in-law, March.
As soon as the king had sailed, March, now heir-by-blood to the crown, was to have been carried off to Wales and proclaimed king, if it were found for certain that <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName> was dead; the Scots were to be called in, and money was to be got from France. Cambridge and his fellows were at once tried, found guilty, and put to death, August 2 and 5.</p>
  <p>2. On the 13th August, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> brought up his fleet of
5000, and, landing, beset Harfleur with an army of 6000 men-at-arms, 24,000 archers, and a number of bombards or siege guns.  The English suffered much from sickness caused by bad weather, unwholesome food, drunkenness, and dirt; but the great guns <hi rend="italics">London</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Messenger</hi>, and
<hi rend="italics">King's Daughter</hi> breached the walls before any aid came from the French council, and Gaucourt, the governor, yielded in despair, September 22.  <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> repaired the walls, and put in an English garrison, under the Earl of
Dorset, his uncle, sent the sick and wounded back to
England, and before leaving the place, wrote a letter to the dauphin in which he offered to fight him man to man, to settle their quarrel without further bloodshed of their countrymen. But the dauphin made no answer, and, October
8, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> started for Calais, with 900 lancers and 5000 bowmen. His way was not easy; the country before him was laid bare by the peasants, some days his men got nothing but walnuts to eat, and the weather was rainy. The lower fords were stopped; but by swift marching and good luck they crossed the Bresle, the Somme, and the water of Swords, and reached Maisoncelles October 24. Here the way was barred by the Constable of France, at the head of 80,000 men. The English halted, watched all night under arms without food, within sight of the French camp-field, and within hearing of their boastful merriment. In the morning,

 after service, they drew up in a field of fresh-sown corn, face to face with the French host, that stretched across the plain by the hamlet of <hi rend="italics">Azincourt</hi>.</p>

  <p><note place="foot" n="3">Battle of Azincourt, Oct. 26, <date value ="1415">1415</date>.</note>
  The king, in full armour, with a jewelled crown glittering on his helmet, set his troops in order, and when all was ready, he prayed aloud for victory.
Then turning to his men he bade them fight boldly, for God was on their side, promised them that
England should never pay ransom  for him, and warned them that the French had cruelly sworn to maim every archer they took, so that he should never shoot again.
When he saw that the constable would not attack, he sent


<pb id="p.302" n="302"/>

 forward two companies through the woods that fringed the plain, with orders to harass the French flank when the battle was joined. He then gave his cousin <placeName key="York">York</placeName> the vanguard to lead, and alighted from his horse, meaning to fight on foot in front of his royal banner in the old English fashion. <q type="spoken">"What time is it now ?"</q> he asked. <q type="spoken">"The bells are ringing prime, my lord?"</q> <q type="spoken">"Now is good time,"</q> said he;
<q type="spoken">"England prayeth for us, let us be of good cheer. Banners, advance !"</q> With a loud shout the English bowmen ran forward twenty paces; then halting, every man planted his five-foot stake which he carried firmly in the earth a pace from that of his comrade, so as to make a palisade which would stop horsemen, but allow footmen to pass through easily.
This done they stepped out a few yards in front, and poured a shower of flight-arrows upon the first lines of French knights: <quote>"And then these Frenchmen came pricking down, as they would have overridden all our company. But God and our archers made them soon to stumble, for our archers shot never arrow amiss, that did not pierce and bring to ground horse and man. And our stakes made them stop, and overturned them one upon another, so that they lay on heaps two spears high. And our king, with his company and his men-at-arms and archers thwacked on them so thick with arrows, and laid on with strokes. And our king fought like a man, with his own hands."</quote> The second French line charged in vain. Our bowmen were stripped to the waist, that they might use their arms more freely, and had one foot bared to get firm foothold in the slippery, rain-sodden, fresh-ploughed ground; they could therefore move more nimbly than their heavy-armed foes. So, as the French approached, they stopped shooting, slung their bows at their backs, and fell on with sword and mall, axe and bill, doing great slaughter. But the French followed on so fast, and were so many, that the whole English army was soon engaged. Gloucester fell at his brother's feet wounded by a dagger-thrust, but <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> strode across him and beat off his assailants.  The Duke of Alencon and a band of knights, who had sworn to take or slay the English king, made their way to where he stood. Alencon felled <placeName key="York">York</placeName> with one blow, and cut the king's crown from his helmet with another, but was borne down and killed by <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s
Welsh squires. The fight had lasted an hour; and now the French knights, leaderless and broken, gave up their swords, so that the English soon made hundreds of prisoners, whom, wishing to save for ransom, they passed under

 guard to the rear of their army. But in the lull before the looked-for onslaught of the third French line, news was brought <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> that an attack was being made upon
Maisoncelles behind him.  Fearing lest his rearguard, cumbered with prisoners, should fall into disorder, he ordered every man to cut down his prisoner without more ado. So, before it was found out that it was but a mob of
French peasants who had come to steal the baggage and the horses, but were driven off in a few minutes, most of the prisoners had been butchered. Meanwhile, the English from the woods burst out upon the flank of the third French line, which, save a few who still followed their leaders to death, turned and fled. The day was <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s; 300 French lords, amongst them the Constable and Admiral of France, and the Dukes of Alencon, Bar, and Brabant, with 8000 knights and squires, and 2000 men-at-arms, lay dead.
The Dukes of Bourbon and Orleans were prisoners. On the English side, the Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and the Earl of
Suffolk and <date value ="1600">1600</date> men only had fallen. The thanksgiving service was held at once on the field by <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s orders, and the English dead and the French arms that could not be taken away, burnt in two large barns. Next morning the conquerors started for Calais, killing the French wounded whom they found alive as they crossed the field of battle.  On November 17, he passed over to England on such a rough day that two ships sank, and the
French prisoners said they would rather fight another battle than go to sea again in a gale. <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> was received with great joy; the <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> townsfolk rushing waist-high into the surf to carry him ashore on their shoulders. There were processions of welcome, and feasts and merry-making at every town he passed through on his way to London; and there the streets were decked, the bells ringing, shows and songs of welcome at every turn, as <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>, clad in a dark purple gown, rode with a grave face to give thanks for his victory at S. Paul's Cathedral, and then went in his barge to the Abbey Church of St. Peter's, Westminster.</p>
  <p>3. The <hi rend="italics">schism</hi> between the rival popes at Rome and
Avignon had caused great grief to all who wished for the good of the Church, which was torn asunder by their quarrels. In <date value ="1409">1409</date> a general Council of clergy, held at <hi rend="italics">Pisa</hi>, had put down the Roman pope Gregory XII. and the
French pope <persName key="Benedict XIII.">Benedict XIII.</persName>, and set up <persName key="John XXIII.">John XXIII.</persName> in their place.  But John led a bad life, and the unseated popes would not yield to the Council's decrees. So things


<pb id="p.304" n="304"/>

 were worse than before. <note place="foot" n="4">The Council of Constance, <dateRange from="1414" to="1418">1414-1418</dateRange>.</note>
Pope John was forced to call another Council at Constance to stop the schism, put down heresy, and reform the Church. There, in <date value ="1414">1414</date>, 18,000 clergymen gathered. They voted in five groups-German,
Italian, French, English, and Spanish. The
English were much looked up to because of their king's power and success, and their own zeal and shrewd speeches; but they quarrelled with the
French clergy, who were also eager for reforms, and little was done, save the trial and burning of John Hus, a learned and much-loved Bohemian professor, who had studied Wiclif's writings, and set forth many of his views.
Sigismund, the emperor-elect, who had spared no pains to get the Council together, therefore went to France, and thence to England, hoping to get <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles</persName> and <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> to make peace, and join him in forwarding real Church reform.  <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> welcomed him with honour, made him a Knight of the Garter, and went with him to Calais in company with another foreign visitor, William, Duke of Holland, to meet Burgundy. Here a league was sealed between the five powers; but Sigismund could not patch up a peace between England and France.    However, the upshot of his journey was that the Bishop of London, backed by the German clergy, got the Council of Constance to choose <persName key="Martin V.">Martin V.</persName> as pope, in place of John and <persName key="Benedict XIII">Benedict</persName>, whom they deposed, while Gregory resigned, so closing the schism for ever.</p>
  <p><persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> went home to prepare for a second campaign, for the crown of France now seemed to be within his reach. He got ample supplies from two parliaments, whose anger was roused by the raids and piracy of the French privateers. He pawned the profits of the custom-duties to the chancellor, and his crown to the city of London for large sums; built a fleet to keep the English seas, gathered ships from the Low Countries to carry his host of 30,000 men across Channel, and hired galleys from the King of
Portugal, who was his ally, because the King of Castile helped the French.</p>
  <p>The Harfleur garrison had not been left in peace. In
<date value ="1416">1416</date>, on a raid into the country, Dorset and his men were surrounded by the army of the new French constable, the
Earl of Armagnac, who summoned them: <q type="spoken">" Now ye be so straitened, with the sea on one side and your foes on the other, ye must needs yield you or die."</q> <q type="spoken">" It was never the wont of Englishmen to yield them when they might fight,"</q>

 answered Dorset, and his little band cut their way through the French, and reached Harfleur with scant loss. Then the constable sent for foreign ships, and beset the town by land and water. Once it was relieved by Bedford, when he sank the Black Hulk of Flanders, and once by Huntingdon, after sharp sea-fights.  And only three days before
<persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> landed in <date value ="1417">1417</date>, Huntingdon relieved it a third time, breaking through the blockade and taking several big
Genoese carracks, huge broad-built vessels which towered a spear's-length over our little 100-ton ships. On September
4, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> stormed the town of C&#x00E6;n, and when the strong castle fell, September 20, he set up his head-quarters there, as Duke of Normandy. Town after town yielded, and by the middle of <date value ="1418">1418</date>, save Rouen, the duchy was his. As he conquered it he set to work to make needful reforms in its government. He gave the estates, earldoms, and baronies thereof to his own nobles and knights. And thus Salisbury,
Talbot, Beaufort, Bedford, and Furnival, got the French earldoms of Perche, Mortain, Maine and Harcourt, Aumale, and others. He also set new officers in place of those who were greedy or oppressive; lightened the taxes; took off the salt-duty, and gave equal rights to all inhabitants, English or
French. In the meantime Burgundy had been doing his best for himself on his side. He won over Isabel of Bavaria,
Charles the Mad's queen, and by the consent of the townsfolk was received into Paris, where the guild-brethren of his party and the mob rose and butchered the constable and chief lords and ladies of the Armagnacs. The little dauphin, <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles</persName>'s youngest son, was only saved by the faithfulness of Tannegui du Chastel, who bore him off secretly to Melun, whither the Armagnac partisans now rallied, proclaiming the dauphin Regent of France. Both sides made vain offers to <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>, who went steadily on with his task of winning the land bit by bit. <note place="foot" n="5">The Siege of Rouen, July 30,

Guy le Butler, the governor, made ready for a long siege.
No less than ten churches and abbeys, near the walls, were pulled down, and all trees and houses within many yards cleared away, that they might not cover the besiegers' attacks. The ditch was cleaned, deepened, dug into narrow pitfalls every two feet, and set as thick with <hi rend="italics">calthrops</hi> [iron spikes linked so that one point will always stand upward] as meshes in a net; the walls were strengthened by earthen mounds, as broad as a cartway, thrown up against them from inside;

 the five main gates, the twenty towers, and the keep were manned and armed, three cannon being mounted on each tower, and nine on each strip of wall, besides engines for beam-hurling and stone-casting. On July 30 King <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> and his army beset the place; with him were the Dukes of
Clarence, Gloucester, and <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> (for Dorset had won the honour of this dukedom by his gallantry), the earl marshal, and the Earls of Salisbury, Suffolk, Kyme, Mortain, and
Ormond, and Janicot the Gascon captain. To prevent any help from landward, a hedge and ditch, with barriers and stout gates, were drawn round the English host that begirt the city. The river was guarded against French relief by iron chains stretched across it, and by a fleet of Portuguese galleys. So strong a place could not be stormed, and sorties were easily repulsed, so the siege settled into a blockade. By Christmas food began to fail the townsfolk, who had 200,000 souls to feed. Bran and vinegar took the place of corn and wine, and when meat and kale were gone they ate the flesh of dogs and cats and mice and rats, and dug up grass and weeds to season it. Yet the price of this wretched food rose so high that many poor died of hunger.
Still the townsfolk looked for help from France or Burgundy, and rather than give in they chose to get rid of all who were too weak to serve in the defence, that the rest might have food for a few days longer. Twelve thousand starving wretches were thrust out at the gates, but <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>, angry at the sturdy faithfulness of the garrison, would not let them pass through his lines.  So, though the English soldiers in pity shared their rations with them, more than half of them perished in the ditch for lack of food and shelter. On New Year's day the garrison at last begged for terms, and the parley went on for a fortnight, when Sir
Guy, finding <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s demands too hard, broke off the treaty, and proposed that the town should be fired, part of the wall suddenly thrown down, and that all who could carry arms should sally through this breach to cut their way through the English lines or die. But the townsfolk forced
Sir Guy to treat again, and, by the archbishop's help, it was settled that if no succour came in eight days' space the city should be given up to <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>. The garrison were to march off unhurt, but three of the townsfolk were to suffer for their resistance, the vicar-general, the chief cannoneer, and the captain of the commons; the town must pay a  50,0000 fine, and build a new castle at their own cost within eighteen months.  The old rights and



<pb id="p.307" n="307"/>
 freedom of the city were to be confirmed by the king.
Accordingly, on January 19, Sir Guy gave up the keys; the brave Alan Blanchard, captain of the commons, was put to death, and next day <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>, clothed in black damask, mounted on a black horse, with a squire behind him bearing a fox-brush on a spear for a banner, rode to the minster to give thanks for his victory. Of the townsfolk, one-fourth of whom had perished, an eye-witness, John Page, says-

       It was a sight of mickle ruth [much pity].
       Much of the folk that was therein,
       They were but bones and the bare skin,
       With hollow eyes and face a-peak,
       They scarce had strength to breathe or speak,
       With colour wan as is the lead,
       Not like live men, but like the dead,
       Fitter models could be none
       From which to paint a skeleton.
       In every street were folk lying dead,
       And others helpless crying for bread;
       Faster they died for many a day
       Than carts could carry them away."</quote></p>

This murder threw all into <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s hands again, for the young duke, Philip the Good, at once joined the

Douglas also promised to raise a small army of Scots to serve with him for an annual pension of 2000. Having the
Scottish king in his camp, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> believed that the Scots in the French service might be cajoled or frightened into going home. After landing at Calais with 4000 lancers and 24,000 archers, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> sent his troops under <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> against the dauphin, who was driven into Bourges, while the King of Scots beset and took Dreux. After a visit to
Paris, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> himself set about the siege of Meaux ; this place had a fine keep called the Market, which was thought to be too strong to be stormed or battered down. It was held by a fierce Armagnac partisan, the Bastard of Vaurus, who plundered the land for miles, and hanged on a lofty elm all prisoners who would not pay the ransom he wished for, so that the Paris merchants who had lost by his forays were glad when, after nearly eight months, the Bastard was starved out, and his head cut off and fixed high on his own elm, June 5, <date value ="1422">1422</date>.

  <p>6. North France was now <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName>'s up to the Loire, and with the King and Queen of France, and his wife, who had come over with her new-born son, <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> of Windsor, to see her father and mother, he kept Whitsuntide, holding open court with great state in Paris. But all this while his health was fast failing: the doctors did not know how to cure him, and when he set out again to help Burgundy against an attack of the dauphin, he had to give up the leadership of the army to Bedford, being too weak to ride. He was borne from Corbeil to Bois Vincennes, and there he died,
August 31, in the thirty-fifth year of his age,-<quote>" small time, but in that small most greatly lived this star of England !"</quote> As he lay on his deathbed he tried to provide for the future. He prayed his brothers not to quarrel, and warned them never to fall out with Burgundy, never to

  <p><quote>"<persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> was tall and strong, spare of flesh by reason of his sober diet and daily exercise,"</quote> and so swift of foot that he is said to have once run down a hart in a park.
His head was round, with broad brows, small ears, cleft chin, and long neck. His eyes and hair were brown, his colour fresh and ruddy, his teeth very white and even. His look was grave and cold, but his smile made his expression pleasing. His manners were courteous, his speech brief, straightforward, and sharp.  His mind was well trained, for though he took much pleasure in hunting, hawking, and feats of arms, he loved his book, and delighted in fair buildings and good art-work. From the day that he was crowned he showed himself a man devout towards God, and just towards men, neither leaning to mercy nor cruelty.
He was slow to promise, but steadfast to his word. He worked hard, and was careless of his own comfort or ease, though he paid great heed to the well-being of his soldiers and servants, requiring in return that they should obey him to the letter. After his first great victory abroad, he seems to have believed that he was chosen by God to punish the sins of the French court and nobles, and to reform and raise the land of France, which God had given him as his lawful heritage; and he acted strictly on this view, looking on those who resisted him as evil-doers and enemies of
God. Had he lived to have won France as was most likely, he wished to head a great crusade from his three kingdoms to drive out the Turk, crush the Mohammedan
Power, and retake the Holy City. <persName key="Henry V.">Henry</persName> was held in awe and love by most Englishmen of his day for his justice, bravery, and success. He came to the throne peaceably, unstained by the treachery and murder that darkened his father's rule, and he died before any ill-hap had touched him. So that, in the next generation, he was looked back to as a saint, and two centuries after was still <quote>"of all that time who lived the king of most renown,"</quote> the chosen hero of our greatest poet. But the fruit of his great deeds were a bitter harvest, and it is truly said of them-

   <p>1. As soon as might be, Parliament was called to settle the ruling of the kingdom while the king was yet a child.
John, Duke of Bedford, <persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName>'s eldest brother, was named Protector of the Realm and Church, and Chief Counsellor, and when he was out of England, his brother, Humfrey, was to take his place. A privy council of the Dukes of <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> and <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, with five bishops, five earls, and five barons, were to help and advise the Protector.
The Duke of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> and his brother the Bishop of Winchester had the care of the baby king. The war was pushed on in France, for when <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles VI.</persName> died within a few days of <persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName>, the Armagnacs had set up the dauphin, <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles VII.</persName>, as their king at Poictiers.
<note place="foot" n="1">Bedford's success in France, <dateRange from="1422" to="1424">1422-1424</dateRange>.</note>
Bedford, a shrewd and hard-working ruler, persuaded
John VI., Duke of Brittany, to come with him to Arras and make friends with Philip of Burgundy, who gave each of the dukes one of his sisters in marriage, and promised hearty aid against <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>. In
July the English and Burgundians under Salisbury beat the
French and Scots at Crevant, through the cowardice of the French leaders. But <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>'s generals overcame the
Burgundians at la Buissiere, and the English at la Gravelle, which mightily encouraged his partisans. Moreover, he sent for troops from Italy, and got 5000 men from Scotland, for which he gave the Earl of Douglas, their captain, his own dukedom of Touraine. To stop more help from Scotland to their foes, the English council thought it best to send King James home again, upon his marrying Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Earl of Somerset, and making peace for some years with England. As soon as James reached
Scotland he had the Scottish regent and his two sons slain as traitors, and busied himself eagerly with making good law and good peace for his people, for he had learned much of law, statecraft, and government at the English court.
But ere long Bedford got rid of the Scots in France by a victory at Verneuil, Aug. 16, <date value ="1424">1424</date>. The Scots and French, eager to attack, fell on disorderly and were beaten, and their leader Douglas, who had mocked Bedford as <quote>" Duke
John with the leaden sword,"</quote> was slain, with nearly all his
Scots and great part of the French.</p>



<pb id="p.313" n="313"/>

  <p>2. And now Salisbury and Bedford would have discomfited the French wholly by Burgundy's help, had it not been for the folly of <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName>. For first he married Jacqueline, the Duchess of Holland, and went over sea with her to win back her heritage from the Duke of Burgundy, who laid claims to it. He spent much money to little end, and was soon forced to come home again, leaving his wife and her money in Mons; and the townsfolk gave her up to
Burgundy, who sent her prisoner to Ghent, whence she escaped to Holland. <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> sent Lord Fitzwalter to help her, but he was driven to sea again at Brewers' Haven by the Burgundians, and after that he was glad to let the matter drop.  Pope Martin judged the marriage to be void, and so Jacqueline made terms with Burgundy and married again, and <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> took to wife Elinor of Cobham, one of Jacqueline's ladies.  But Humfrey's action had so angered the Duke of Burgundy that he challenged him to a duel, and was hardly withheld from joining the
French, though Bedford gave him two rich earldoms in north France to appease him. <note place="foot" n="2"><persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName>'s quarrel, with Burgundy and the Cardinal <dateRange from="1424" to="1427">1424-1427</dateRange>.</note>
And now that <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> was back in England, he fell out with his uncle,
Henry Beaufort, Bishop of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, who had been the friend of <persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName>, and was the best statesman in the council. Humfrey was handsome and fair-spoken, and the Londoners liked him; so when he forbade the mayor to let the bishop pass through the city to the Tower the gates were shut.
<quote>"And between 9 and 10 of the clock there came certain men of the bishop's and drew the chains out of the staples at the bridge-end on the Southwark side, both knights and squires, with a great company of archers, and they embattled themselves and guarded windows and peep-holes as though it had been in a land of war. And when the people of the city heard thereof, they made haste to the bridgegates to keep the city and save it against the king's enemies, and all the shops in London were shut within an hour.
And then came my lord of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName> and the Prince of
Portugal (the king's cousin, now visiting England) and parleyed between the duke and the bishop, riding eight times between them that day. And in the end, by good persuasion of the mayor and aldermen, all the people were pacified and sent home again, and none harm done throughout all the city."</quote> But the bishop wrote at once to beg Bedford to come home, <quote>" for if ye tarry long, we shall put this land in jeopardy with a field [to the hazard of a battle].

So, by persuasion of Bedford and the Lords, they shook hands. Bedford and his brother also swore that they would be counselled and ruled in their office of regent and protector by the Lords in parliament or in council, for <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> had boasted that he would rule as he liked as soon as his brother had left.</p>

 In <date value ="1427">1427</date> Beaufort and Bedford left England together
 for Rouen, where Beaufort was to receive the cardinal's
 hat Pope Martin had sent him, and where he was also made
 legate and captain of a crusade which was on foot against
 the Bohemians. For they followed the teachings of <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wyclif</persName>
 and Hus his disciple, and had taken up arms against the
 bishops and nobles who would have forced them to obey
 the Church. And at this time it seemed to Beaufort that
 he could do more good by busying himself
 with the good of the Church than with the
 English government.  Bedford found matters
 going well for him in France. He soon forced
 the Duke of Brittany to leave the dauphin and hold to his
 oath at Troyes, and bit by bit, so good was his rule, that
 the French chose rather to make terms with him for the
 sake of being able to till the ground and trade in peace.
 For he put down the brigands that roamed about disguised as English soldiers, robbing and murdering the people; he struck good money, lightened the taxes, fostered the trades and crafts of the towns, and made many good laws to secure the health and safety of the king's French lieges [subjects]. But Bedford's council in France wished to bring the war to a speedy end by taking Orleans, the strongest city the Armagnacs held, and then crossing the
Loire to hunt the dauphin out of the land.  Thomas Montague, Earl of Salisbury and Perche, therefore attacked



<pb id="p.315" n="315"/>


Orleans, stormed the Tournelles, a fort which stood at the end of the bridge before the city, and beset the whole place with batteries and works, for it was too well garrisoned to be stormed.  But on the 27th October <date value ="1428">1428</date>, as the earl stood at a window of the Tournelles looking over the city, he was struck down and wounded to death by the splinter of a cannon ball that struck the window; and this was held to be a great loss to the English.  But the regent sent the
Earl of Suffolk to go on with the siege, and he closed all the approaches to Orleans by land or water with thirteen strong forts, so that the city was hard put to it.  On February 12, <date value ="1429">1429</date>, as Sir John Fastolf was bringing a long train of wagons laden with flour and herrings for the besiegers' food, he was attacked at Rouvray by the Earl of
Clermont and Sir John Stewart; but he drew up his wagons in a ring and set his archers to guard the entries, and they drove off the French, who tried to break in, till they withdrew hopeless of success. And Fastolf got all his wagons safely into the English camp. The citizens were now nearly in despair; they could get no supplies, and their stores were running low. They therefore offered to give up their town to Burgundy to hold as long as their own duke was a prisoner in England. But Bedford (much to
Burgundy's displeasure) refused to let go a prize which
English blood had bought, and waited till the city should be starved into surrender.  The dauphin saw no means of relieving it, and had almost made up his mind to leave
France altogether for a time, when help came from  a quarter whence no man had expected it.</p>

She was seventeen or eighteen years old, well limbed and strong.
And one day, without taking leave of her father or mother
(not that she did not hold them in honour and respect, but because she did not tell them lest they might hinder her intent), this maid went to Vaucouleurs to my lord Robert of Baudricourt, a knight of the dauphin's, and said to him, <q type="spoken">'My lord captain, know that, for some time back, at divers times God hath made known to me and commanded me to go to the gentle dauphin, who should be and is the true King of

Rheims, win back Paris, and drive the English from the realm.'</q>  But my lord Robert took these things to be dreams.   Nevertheless, at last he hearkened to her words, furnished her with a man's gown and hood, skirt, hose, and riding-boots with spurs, and gave her in charge of two gentlemen who took her to the dauphin. To him she gave her message, and at first he would not believe her; but in the end, by the advice of his council and of the clergy, he agreed to send her with a train of provisions that he hoped to be able to get secretly into Orleans. She was therefore given armour like a knight's, and she sent for a certain sword that was laid up in a church hard by, and had a white banner made, upon which was the image of the Lord and two angels, and so set forth with a small company."</quote>  And as she lay at Blois, on her way towards Orleans, she wrote a letter which she sent to the English captains that were keeping the siege before Orleans, saying-</p>
  <p><quote>"King of England, do right to the King of Heaven, respecting the blood-royal of France. Give back to the Maid the keys of all the towns which you have broken into. The Maid is come by God's order to call back the blood-royal of France, and she is all ready to make peace if you will do right. King of England, if you do not this thing,
I am captain of war, and from every place in which I shall reach your folk in France, if they will not obey, I shall make them go forth whether they will or no; and if they will obey me I will take them to mercy [give them quarter]. And all of you, archers, noble and gentle companions in arms that are before Orleans,-begone into your own land for God's sake, and if ye do not so, beware of the
Maid, and bethink you of your hurt.  Neither believe within you that ye can withhold France from the King of Heaven, the Son of the blessed Mary, for King <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName> shall have it, the true heir, to whom God hath given it, and he shall enter into Paris with a fair company.

  <p>But the English laughed at her threats, and swore to burn her as a witch if they could catch her. Yet they did not try to stop the army that was with her from coming into the town; and when the townsfolk heard that she was nigh, they begged her to come in, and when she was come in, welcomed her with great joy. <quote>" And before she came two hundred English would drive five hundred Frenchmen before them  in a bicker, but after her coming two hundred

And then she said to her men, <q type="spoken">"All is yours, enter in!"</q>
And the French pressed on, fired the Towers, and stormed the Bulwark; and there were drowned in the ditch, trying to escape, the captain, Glasdale, and two English lords with most of their men. And that night the English raised the siege of Orleans and departed to Maine, leaving their big guns and much victual behind them.
And the news disheartened the English, who thought that <persName key="Darc, Joan">Joan</persName> must really be a witch; but it put fresh hopes into the Frenchmen, who believed that she was sent from
God to free France. Without delay <persName key="Darc, Joan">Joan</persName> rode to Tours, and begged the dauphin to make ready to be crowned at
Rheims, where it had been the wont of French kings to be hallowed. And by her bravery the way thither was soon cleared. Jargeau fell in a week, when Suffolk and his brother were made prisoners. Meun was taken next, Lord
Talbot and Sir John Fastolf retreating before her. And in
June the dauphin reached Rheims (Troyes yielding to him on the way thither), and was crowned there, to the joy of all the French. And now <persName key="Darc, Joan">Joan</persName> persuaded the king to march upon Paris, promising him success. On the way thither Bedford met them, but he did not offer battle, because he was hurrying to Normandy to drive out the Constable of France, who had attacked it while he was away. So the way lay open, town after town welcomed <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>; but he was half-hearted, and when the first attack on Paris failed he withdrew like a coward to Bourges in spite of all <persName key="Darc, Joan">Joan</persName>'s prayers.
Then she hung up her arms in the Church of S. Denis, and begged leave to go home to her father and mother and keep their sheep and cattle, and do as she was wont to do aforetime.

But <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName> would not let her go, and gave her a pension, and made herself and her kinsmen nobles. And in spite of her wishes she was sent to raise the siege of
Compiegne, but there she was wounded and taken, through the flight of her followers, by a Burgundian knight. The
English bought her from their allies, and had her tried by the Bishop of Beauvais for witchcraft.  She was found guilty, forced to sign a paper confessing her guilt, made to swear that she would never again wear men's clothes, and condemned to prison for her life. But her jailers tricked her into breaking her vow, and on May 30, <date value ="1431">1431</date>, she was led out to the market-place of Rouen to be burned alive as an obstinate misbeliever. In her last words out of the fire she testified to the truth of her visions, declaring that God had sent her.

 The English were not idle, however. Beaufort, who
 nad now come home from an unsuccessful campaign in
 Bohemia, generously lent the regent the money and troops
 which he had raised for a second crusade there. The
 young king, having been crowned at Westminster, was taken
 over to France, to be hallowed there also, and as Rheims
 was in <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>'s hand, his coronation took place with great
 state in Paris. Burgundy was kept from joining the French by the gift of the regency of
 France, Bedford contenting himself with the
 regency of Normandy.  The French were
 beaten in repeated skirmishes, and the plots in Normandy speedily put down. But all was in vain; slowly,
 bit by bit, France was slipping from the regent's hands.
In <date value ="1432">1432</date> the death of the <quote>" good Duchess Anne,"</quote> Burgundy's sister, and Bedford's speedy remarriage to the Earl of S.
Paul's sister Jacquette, brought on an open quarrel between the dukes at S. Omer. In <date value ="1433">1433</date> Bedford went home to England, where his help was needed. The people were not pleased with the government. A Lollard leader, named
Jack Sharp, had tried to rouse the country folks against the bishops and beneficed clergy, but had been put down and executed by <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName>. Money was needed to carry on

 the war, and <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName>, accusing Beaufort's friends of mismanagement, turned them out of office, and put in a new treasurer. He also charged the cardinal with unlawfully accepting the hat and retaining the see of <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>.
But the Parliament, pleased with Beaufort's generous loans of money to the king, declared him to have acted lawfully.
Bedford set the two again at peace, gave up great part of his salary, and got grants to pay off the royal debts. So well did he rule as Chief Counsellor of the Realm (for the name of Regent was dropped in <date value ="1429">1429</date>), that the Parliament, dreading the enmity between Humfrey and his uncle, besought him to abide in England. However, on <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> attacking his conduct of the war abroad, he decided to leave once more. In <date value ="1435">1435</date> he met Burgundy at Paris, and agreed to send Beaufort to a congress at Arras, which Pope
Gregory IV. had brought about with a view of putting an end to the war between England and France. The only result was that Burgundy was sent over by his French brothers-in-law, Bourbon and the Constable of France, to make peace with King <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>. Overwork, disappointment at the overthrow of all his plans, and despair at the future, had broken Bedford's health, and, after a short illness, he died at Rouen, before the congress ended.  With him the English chance of completely winning the French kingdom was altogether lost.</p>

The English were angry at Philip's desertion, and taunted him as a traitor and forsworn, and when he laid siege to Calais, Edmund Beaufort, Earl of Mortain, beat him off with ease. <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> was made Earl of Flanders and Captain of Calais, and the war was pushed on briskly for a time. But as one regent after another, the Duke of
<placeName key="York">York</placeName>, the Earl of Warwick, and the Earl of Somerset, found it hard to hold their own against the French, the cardinal and the Beauforts made a truce with Burgundy in <date value ="1434">1434</date>, and began to think of making terms with <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>. On the other hand, <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> threw the whole blame of their ill success upon their bad management. And when Orleans was set free in <date value ="1440">1440</date> as a first step to bring about a peace, he wrote a bitter protest, accusing the cardinal of using his power for his own selfish ends, of taking lands and money from the king by fraud, and of risking the loss of France by letting Orleans out of prison.

 bloodshed and taxation, and because it was unjust to deny a prisoner ransom for ever. Next year <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> was attacked in the person of his wife Elinor, who was accused of practising witchcraft against the king's life, tried, and condemned to prison for life, while two of her fellow-plotters were put to death. But the people were sorry for her, and watched her with tears and pity as she walked in her penance, black-clad and barefoot, through the London streets, before she was sent to her prison.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the ministry were trying to bring about a peace by way of a marriage between the young king and a
French princess.  <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> wished that <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> should marry the Earl of Armagnac's daughter, and so strengthen himself in Guienne. But Suffolk and Orleans met at Tours in <date value ="1444">1444</date>, and arranged for a truce between the two kingdoms, and for the marriage of <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> to a favourite cousin of
<persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>-Margaret, daughter to Regnier, the Earl of Provence, Duke of Anjou and Maine, and King (in title only) of
Naples and Jerusalem.  Suffolk was so eager for peace that he not only agreed for the lady to come to her husband portionless, but promised that Anjou and Maine should be given up to Regnier. Some said he was tricked into this promise by the French having seized Margaret before she could reach England, but more thought that Suffolk was acting treacherously toward the king, from hopes of future aid from France to further his own crafty schemes. On
April 22, <date value ="1445">1445</date>, the marriage took place, and now Suffolk and Beaufort, by the young queen's favour, ruled as they liked. The queen was jealous of <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName>, because he had opposed her marriage, and because he was the next heir to the crown if her husband died childless.  And
Suffolk was about to marry the little Lady Margaret, daughter of the Duke of Somerset, to his own son, so that it was thought he would try to make him the next king, rather than let <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> rule, if anything should happen to King <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>.   <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName>, on his side, never ceased to oppose the plans of Beaufort and Suffolk, and bitter hate was kept up between his party and the government. In February <date value ="1447">1447</date> a Parliament was called at Bury, to find money for the king to visit France and make a settled peace. But as <persName key="Gloucester, Humphrey">Gloucester</persName> rode thither he found all the roads guarded as though he were an enemy. And when he reached his lodgings he was arrested, and kept in close custody till, on the morning of February 23, he was found dead in his bed, murdered, as most men believed, by the


<pb id="p.321" n="321"/>

 order of Suffolk, who declared that he had been plotting to make himself king.   A few weeks after his turbulent nephew's sudden end, the cardinal Henry died, full of years, at <placeName key="Winchester">Winchester</placeName>.  And in him the king lost his last honest friend. For proud, impatient, and fond of power as he was, the cardinal had never spared his time or money in his kinsman's service, and had always advised him to the best of his knowledge. Yet his government had not brought peace, and worse was to follow.</p>

  <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>'s gentle mind, weak health, and retired habits unfitted and indisposed him to govern by himself, and his power was intrusted to the hands of Suffolk, Somerset, and the queen, who were all three headstrong, selfish, and unpopular. Their blunders and bad luck soon roused against them a strong party, headed by the Lords of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and
Salisbury, and upheld by all who suffered by the faults or misfortunes of the ministers. Plague and bad weather and famine wrought some misery at this time, and this was heightened by the weak rule which suffered wrongs and crimes to go unpunished and unatoned. Risings in arms, under Bluebeard and other popular leaders, were indeed put down harshly, but nothing was done to amend matters, or carry the law out fairly against all evil-doers. Traders and merchants grumbled at the piracy which was suffered unchecked to waste the English coast and sweep the Channel. The over-kindness of the king and the greed of the courtiers soon led to new debts, and wasted money now sorely needed for the war.
For Suffolk, trusting in the boasted skill of Somerset, the
Lieutenant of France, had suffered the truce to be broken, hoping, perhaps, that a victory might bring him nearer to a final peace with <persName key="Charles VII.">Charles</persName>. But the French veterans and their powerful cannon took town after town, in spite of Somerset's struggles. In <date value ="1448">1448</date> Rouen surrendered; in the next spring
Bayeux, C&#x00E6;n, Falaise fell one by one, and on 12th August
Cherbourg yielded, and the mainland of Normandy was once more a French duchy.</p>
  <p>In the Parliament of <date value ="1450">1450</date> Suffolk was impeached by the
Commons for high treason in betraying the king's interests to the French king, for plotting to make his own son, John de la
Pole, king, and for misusing his power as minister to injure the guiltless. The duke protested his innocence, but offered to submit to the king's will. <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> set aside the charges, but to please the Commons and save his favourite's life, banished him from England for five years.

 determined that the hated <soCalled>"Jack-a-napes,"</soCalled> as he was called by the people, should not go free. His friend, the Bishop of
Chichester, had been murdered by the sailors at Portsmouth in January; and now, as the duke sailed into France one
Thursday in May, there met him a ship called the Nicholas of the Tower, the master of which bade him come on board, and when he came hailed him as traitor. He asked the name of the ship, and when he remembered that it had been told him that he would be safe if only he could escape the Tower, his heart failed him. <quote>"And so he lay in the
Nicholas till Saturday next following, when, in the sight of all his men, he was drawn out of the great ship into the boat, and there was an axe and a stock. And one of the lowest in the ship, an Irishman, bade him lay down his head and he should be fairly dealt with and die by a sword, and took a rusty sword and smote off his head within half a dozen strokes, and took away his gown of russet and his doublet of velvet mailed [studded], and laid his body on the sands of <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> and his head on a pole by it."</quote> Thus began sorrow upon sorrow and death for death.</p>

Cade fell back to Sevenoaks, but there he defeated the royal force sent against him, and <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>, finding his soldiers would not oppose the commons, withdrew to Kenilworth.
On July 3 Cade entered London with all his people, <quote>"and there had it cried in the king's name and his that no man should rob nor take no man's goods but if he paid for it.
And he came riding through the city in great pride, and smote his sword upon London stone. And he had Lord

And the aldermen sent to Lord Scales, the keeper of the
Tower, and prayed him to help them drive out the captain and his host. So the soldiers seized London Bridge by night and held it against the commons, who lay at Southwark. When they had fought all night, the chancellor,

Still Somerset, who had urged the king to force <placeName key="York">York</placeName> to confess his treason by imprisoning and torturing him, remained minister. However, John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, was sent with an army to win back
Gascony, for the townsfolk of Bordeaux had begged

Next spring the French besieged his garrison in Chatillon, and cast up a great trenched camp there lined with cannon. Talbot attacked them unawares and broke into their works, when the Earl of Penthievre brought up fresh troops, and the deadly fire of the cannon stayed the English advance. Talbot was killed, and his son fell fighting to the last over his father's body, while the rest of their little army was forced to flight or taken.

Parliament met soon after in London; the duke and his friends, Salisbury and his son, Richard Earl of Warwick, were pronounced by the king good and faithful subjects, and the blame of the mal-journey [bad day's work] at S.

In November <date value ="1455">1455</date> <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> again went mad, and <placeName key="York">York</placeName> was a second time named Protector, till the king's recovery in February relieved him of his office.

The king, on the other hand, laboured earnestly for quiet, and when the French (under Margaret's friend, Peter of

Warwick was made Captain of Calais, and he soon showed the French privateers that they could not range unchecked in English waters; but the favour the people showed him awoke rage and fear in the courtiers, and they seem to have plotted to murder him and <placeName key="York">York</placeName>.

September 23, <date value ="1459">1459</date>, and Salisbury, refusing to obey the warrant, defeated and slew Audley, and reached Ludlow safely, where Warwick joined them with his trained troops from Calais. <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>, who was at Worcester with 60,000 men, bade them lay down their arms within six days and he would forgive them; but they refused, declaring they could not trust his evil counsellors. At Ludford, where the Yorkists entrenched themselves, there was a skirmish, but Sir Andrew Trollop and the Calais men would not fight against the king's standard, and went over to <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>; whereon the duke's army melted away in fear, no man trusting his neighbour. <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, thus forsaken, went off to Ireland, where he had many fast friends, while Salisbury and

  The Londoners welcomed the earls gladly; so leaving
Salisbury governor there to watch Lord Scales (who held the Tower for the king), they marched on with 60,000 men to
Northampton. Here <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> and his council had entrenched themselves in force. After trying in vain three times to see the king, Warwick set up the royal standard, and with the legate's blessing led the attack, ordering his soldiers to spare the king and the commons, but cut down the gentry.
The rain damped the king's powder, Lord Grey of Ruthyn went over with his men to Warwick, and in a few minutes
Buckingham, Shrewsbury, Beaumont, Egremont, and some
300 knights were slain, the queen and little prince in flight, and the king a captive.  The earls received <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> with great respect, and brought him to London with them.
Warwick's brother, George Neville, Bishop of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, was made chancellor, and a parliament was called. Here <persName key="York">York</persName> appeared (the acts of Coventry being repealed), and laid claim to the throne as heir of <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>, through Lionel of Clarence. A compromise was devised by the chancellor, which the Lords agreed to lay before the king, who, by their advice, and to spare further bloodshed, accepted it. <quote>" The king was to keep the crowns and his estates and dignity royal during his life, and the duke and his heirs to succeed him in the same;"</quote> the princedom of Wales and earldom of Chester were given to the duke with an income of 10,000 marks, and it was to be high treason to kill him.</p>

  Meanwhile the queen and her son, who, after many adventures both by sea and land, had reached Scotland, appeared at <persName key="York">York</persName> with a large force of borderers eager for booty, and of north-country levies, who hated the Protector.
With her were Somerset and Devon, and the northern barons
<placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, Clifford, and Dacres. <persName key="York">York</persName>, with Rutland and Salisbury, hastened to Sandal Castle with a small company to watch his foes, and to wait till March could bring up the western levies, and Warwick the Londoners and <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>ish men. After a skirmish at Worksop, <persName key="York">York</persName> was lured into fighting at Wakefield, December 29, I460, and there defeated and slain.  His son, Rutland, was seized and butchered  by Clifford, and  Salisbury beheaded next day at Pontefract.  By the queen's order,

<placeName key="York">York</placeName>. So perished the wisest statesman left in England.</p>
  <p>March, warned of this defeat, now started eastward to join Warwick at London; and <persName key="Tudor, Owen">Owen Tudor</persName> (who had married <persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName>'s widow, Katherine), with his son Jasper, Earl of Pembroke, and the Earl of Wiltshire, attacked him on his way at Mortimer's Cross, February 3, <date value ="1461">1461</date>. But he turned upon them fiercely, and routed them, and taking <persName key="Tudor, Owen">Owen Tudor</persName> prisoner, slew him in revenge for his father, and laid his head on the highest step of the market cross at Haverfordwest. Meanwhile Margaret, with her victorious army, had marched towards London, till, on February 17th, she found her way barred by Warwick, who held S. Albans against her.  After one repulse, for the Yorkists were strongly posted, the queen's troops drove Warwick's men through the town and cleared the road. But the Yorkists withdrew unpursued under cover of night, and with Warwick at their head turned west to meet the Earl of March. By this victory
Margaret rescued her husband, who was left behind by Warwick in his retreat. <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> sent to London for supplies, and the mayor ordered that certain carts laden with victual should be sent to them to S. Albans. " But when the carts came to Cripplegate, the commons of the city that kept the gate took the victual from the carts, and would not suffer it to pass. Then were certain aldermen and commoners appointed to go to Barnet to speak with the queen's council, to entreat that the northern men should be sent home to their country. For the city of London did dread sore to be robbed and spoiled if they had come."
But while they treated, news came that the Earls of March and Warwick had met at Chipping Norton, and were on their way to London. So the king and queen turned north lest they should be surrounded by their foes. The
Londoners were glad to be saved from Margaret's border freebooters, and welcomed the young Earl of March as the <quote>"White Rose of Rouen,"</quote> singing-

 <p>1. But there could not be two kings in England, so without delay <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> set forth to defeat his foes and avenge his
 father. King <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> and the queen lay at <placeName key="York">York</placeName> with 60,000
 men. <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> and Warwick led 50,000 against them. The
 vanguards fought at Ferrybridge, which was seized for
 <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> by Lord Fitzwalter, who was slain by Lord Clifford.
 <note place="foot" n="1">Towton field Palm Sunday <date value ="1461">1461</date>.</note>
 But Lord Falconbridge came up, killed Clifford, and retook
 the bridge. Next day, 28th March, at nine in
 the morning, the two great hosts met on the
 moor by Towton. There was a thick fall of
 snow in the faces of the Lancastrians, and their arrows fell short of the mark; when their quivers were empty, the
Yorkists drew near, poured in volley upon volley, and then charged.  But the northern footmen held their ground bravely in the sword-play, and only gave way about three in the afternoon, when Norfolk brought up <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s rearguard. <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> pressed on the pursuit without quarter, and drove his defeated foes into the river Cock, where many were drowned. All through the night the Lancastrians fled and the Yorkists pressed upon their heels, cutting them down without mercy, so that by the sunset next day they had slain more than 30,000 men; among them were the Earl of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, six barons, and Sir
Andrew Trollop. But Somerset and <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> escaped, and
<persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName>, the queen, and the prince (who had stayed at <placeName key="York">York</placeName> during the battle) fled after them to Scotland, where they were welcomed, for they gave up Berwick to the King of
Scots, who at once sent an army into England to check the Yorkists and beset <placeName key="Carlisle">Carlisle</placeName>. But Lord Montague, who had been left to guard the north while <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> went to
London to be crowned, relieved <placeName key="Carlisle">Carlisle</placeName>, and overthrew the
Scots with great slaughter. On the 28th June <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> was crowned, and Parliament met on the 4th November. He had already given new honours to many of his truest friends.
His two young brothers, George and Richard, were made
Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester, William Neville Lord
Falconbridge was made Earl of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, Lord Bourchier Earl of Essex, and Humfrey Bourchier and William Herbert barons. Parliament declared <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s title good, and the three Henries usurpers, but confirmed the Acts passed under

</note> their rule, so that no man should suffer by the coming of the true king. A Bill of Attainder was passed against the late king, his wife and son, and the chief lords that had stood by them alive or dead. The young king thanked them for the tender and true hearts they had shown him with all his heart, <q type="spoken">"and if I had any better good,"</q> said he, <q type="spoken">" to reward you withal than my body, ye should have it." </q> He did not need their money, for he had lately borrowed 120,000 florins from Cosmo dei Medici, the rich lord of Florence.</p>
  <p>2. <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> was possibly not sorry to be rid of all the cares of the crown, but Margaret, eager to revenge her friends, and determined to win back her son's heritage, left no stone unturned in gathering strength for another attack on
<persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>.   Scotland was at this time weakened by the struggles between the royal house and the powerful Douglas and Angus families, which had prevented the Scottish kings from taking advantage of the weakness of England during <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName>'s reign. And James II.'s death at the siege of Roxburgh in <date value ="1460">1460</date>, left his crown to a child, James
III.  <note place="foot" n="2">Margaret's attacks foiled, and King <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> taken, <dateRange from="1461" to="1463">1461-1463</dateRange>.</note>
It was in vain that Margaret gained the Earl of
Angus's aid, for <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> bribed the Earl of Ross, Lord of the Isles, and won over the Dowager-Queen Mary, so the
Scots agreed not to interfere. Margaret therefore sought help from abroad. The Duke of Brittany gave her money, and Louis XI. of France, on her promise of yielding Calais as soon as she had won back her husband's throne, lent her 20,000 crowns, and sent Peter of Breze with
2000 men to Scotland with her.  But again she failed; her friend <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> was tried by
Roman law before the Constable Tiptoft Earl of Worcester, for corresponding with her, and beheaded.
Her fleet was wrecked with all her treasure, and the most part of her foreign allies only escaped death by water to be taken prisoners on Holy Island in <date value ="1462">1462</date>. Margaret and
Peter reached Berwick alone in a fisher-boat. The three strongholds which the Lancastrians had taken were retaken by Warwick. Even Somerset, <persName key="Percy, Henry">Percy</persName>, and Sir Ralph
Grey now gave up the Red Rose, and swore fealty to <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>.
But Margaret did not despair, and in <date value ="1463">1463</date> the exiles, with
Scottish help, made a second attack upon the north of
England, when they were joined by the faithless Somerset and his friends.  But John Neville overcame them  at
Hedgley, April 15, where <persName key="Percy, Henry">Percy</persName> fell <quote>"fighting like a man,"</quote> and at Hexham, May  5, where Somerset was taken and beheaded, while Warwick battered Bamborough Castle

Grey, was brought to the king, judged, and put to death at
Doncaster. Margaret and her son were in Flanders, and
King <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry</persName> in Lancashire, where he lurked in hiding till
<date value ="1466">1466</date>, when he was betrayed by Sir James Harrington and his friends Tempest of Branwell and Talbot of Bashall.
Warwick brought him to London, and had him lodged in the Tower, where he was safely kept, and not unkindly treated.</p>

  <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> determined to plant himself so firmly on his throne that he should not be lightly overthrown. He sent embassies to most of the courts of Europe, made truces with Scotland and France, and treaties of peace and trade with Burgundy, Brittany, Aragon, Castille, Denmark, and Poland. He took care to reward his friends, giving John Neville the earldom of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, and
George Neville the archbishopric of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, and making
Lord Herbert Earl of Pembroke. But he grew restless under the constant control which Warwick sought to keep over him, and when he was desired to marry Bona, sister of Louis XI., he refused, and privately married (in I464) a widow, Lady
Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Jacquette of Luxemburgh and her second husband, the <soCalled>"handsome Woodville"</soCalled> Lord Rivers. The new queen was crowned, May 26,
<date value ="1465">1465</date>, amid great rejoicings. And as <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> could trust her kinsfolk to stand by him, he resolved to enrich them, so that he might have partisans of his own, who should not owe anything to the Nevilles or Bourchiers. Accordingly
Lord Rivers was made Treasurer, the queen's sisters married to the Duke of Buckingham and the heirs of Arundel and Pembroke, her elder brother to the heiress of Scales, her younger brother to the Dowager-Duchess of Norfolk, and her son, Thomas Grey, to the king's niece, the heiress of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>.  Warwick looked with displeasure on the favour shown to these <quote>" upstarts,"</quote> but he grew angry when
<persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> gave his own sister Margaret in marriage to
Charles, Earl of Charolois, Burgundy's son, a man with whom he was at deadly feud. And in spite of a reconciliation (brought about by George Neville), he began to cast about for means of regaining his power. Clarence, jealous of his brother, and eager for a crown, easily fell in with the kingmaker's plans, and in July <date value ="1469">1469</date> married his elder daughter Isabel, at Calais.  Margaret and her party

 in the north began again to raise their heads, and as
<persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> disgusted some men by his favour to the woodvilles, and others by his strict justice and the stern way in which he punished any one who broke the law, she found here and there those who for their own ends were ready to stir up civil war again. Early in <date value ="1469">1469</date> the <placeName key="York">York</placeName>shire commons rose under Robert Hulyard, calling himself Robin of
Holderness, and complaining of the tithes. John Neville put them down, and killed their leader. Sir William Conyers, a Lancastrian, known as Robin of Redesdale, with
Clarence's approval and Warwick's knowledge had already raised a great host, and published articles complaining of the king's bad counsellors, the Woodvilles. July 26, the king's Welsh troops were beaten at Edgecote, and the Earls of Pembroke, Devon, and Rivers were afterwards taken and beheaded by Clarence's orders. <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> saw nothing better than give himself up to George Neville, by whose advice and his mother's, the Duchess of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, he was reconciled with Warwick and Clarence, who were afraid of going too far, for <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> was very well liked by the people of
London and by the merchants and farmers, who were glad of the good peace and stern justice he kept. In <date value ="1470">1470</date>, however,
Sir Robert Welles put himself at the head of a rising in
<placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>shire by secret orders from Clarence and Warwick.
<persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>, now knowing the danger of such movements, at once, by quick marching, came up with the rebels, and set upon them near Stamford, March 29. The fire of his cannon put them to flight, and the day was remembered as Lose-coat field, from the white gaberdines the rebels threw off in their hurry to get away. Welles was taken, and confessed that there was a plot to make Clarence king. <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> therefore wrote to Clarence and Warwick to urge them to come back to their duty, and on their delay proclaimed them traitors.
They fled to France, where Louis welcomed them warmly, and, at Amboise, by his persuasion Warwick was brought to offer Queen Margaret (who was with her son at Louis' court) his help to put her captive husband back on his throne.  Margaret hung back at first, but at last agreed that her son <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> should marry Warwick's second daughter Anne, and that Clarence and Warwick should be
Lieutenants of the Realm till the prince was of age. Clarence, though he put a fair face on it, did not like this new plan of Warwick's, and began to write secret messages to
King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>, telling him that he was only waiting for a fit time to show his loyalty to him.</p>

  <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> paid little heed at first to the treaty of
Amboise, though Charles, his brother-in-law (now Duke of
Burgundy), who hated Warwick, not only warned him of his danger, but blockaded the Seine mouth for him. Profiting by a gale, which drove off the Flemish fleet, Warwick and
Clarence slipped past them, and landed at Dartmouth
September 13, <date value ="1470">1470</date>.  The queen and her son, with his young wife, were to follow when all was at peace again.
King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> was lured to the north to meet John Neville
(whom he had made Marquis Montague, and whom he trusted entirely), leaving his queen in the Tower. And as he lay in bed at Doncaster one morning, there came to him
Alexander of <placeName key="Carlisle">Carlisle</placeName>, the chief of his minstrels, and
Alexander Lee, a priest, and bade him rise and flee, for
Montague was within an hour's ride seeking to take him prisoner. He flung on his clothes, and moneyless and with no armour but a light brigandine [studded coat], he rode down to
Lynn with Hastings, Rivers, and a few friends.
There they embarked in three small ships, and set sail for
Holland. After being nearly taken by some ships of the
Hanse Towns, who chased them ashore at Alcmaar, they were kindly received by Louis of Bruges, Earl of Grauthus, and taken to Duke Charles's court. Queen Elizabeth fled to Westminster with her daughters. Clarence and Warwick, finding none to say them nay, went to London, took King
<persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> out of prison, and setting him on horseback, in a long gown of blue velvet, led him to S. Paul's, while all cried, <quote>"God save King Harry !"</quote> And the lords that had been disinherited, Jasper Earl of Pembroke, and his nephew Henry Earl of Richmond, and the Dukes of
Somerset and <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, came back to their estates. But the
Earl of Worcester, John Tiptoft, the most learned and best-read noble in England, was taken and beheaded, because, when he was constable under King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>, he had judged men to death by the law of Padua [Roman law]. The
Parliament declared <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> a usurper, and confirmed the agreement made between Warwick and Margaret at
Amboise. Louis of France made a treaty with <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> for fifteen years. But Burgundy, though he did not dare openly to make war for his brother-in-law <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>, gave him both money, men, and ships, and counselled him to go to England and see if he could win back his crown either by fair words or war.</p>

Ravenspur, March <date value ="1471">1471</date>. Like <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry IV.</persName> before, he declared that he was only come to claim his own lands, and even swore to this at <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, before he turned southward. Montague let him pass without drawing sword, Stanley joined him at Nottingham, and Clarence at Coventry. Warwick, who was near his road, refused to fight him or to make peace.

So raising his standard as king he pushed on to London, when George, the Archbishop of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, opened the gates to him. He entered, made King <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> prisoner again, and taking him with him, marched out to Barnet, where Warwick and Montague were in battle array. Clarence offered to make peace between them, but Warwick was too angry with his double faithlessness to listen to him. <quote>"And all that night both sides loosed guns at each other, and on
Easter Day early next morning, April 14, they fell upon each other; and there was such a great mist that neither side could see the other clearly. And divers times the earl's party had the victory, and supposed that they had won the field. But it happened that the Earl of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>'s men had upon them their lord's livery, which was a star with streams [rays] much like King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s livery-a sun with streams [rays]. And the mist was so thick that a man might not perfectly judge one thing from another.  So
Warwick's men shot and fought against <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>'s men, thinking that they were King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s men, and soon the
Earl of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> and his men cried,<q type="spoken"> 'Treason ! treason !'</q> and fled away from the field 800 men. But the Marquis
Montague was agreed to come over to King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>, and he put upon him King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s livery in the midst of the battle; and a man of the Earl of Warwick saw that, and fell upon him and killed him. And when the Earl of Warwick saw his brother dead, and <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> fled, he leaped on horse-back and fled to a wood by the field of Barnet which there was no way out of. And one of King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s men espied him, and came upon him there and killed him, and spoiled him of his armour and clothes."</quote> And when King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> knew that he had won the day he took horse and rode through the field crying to his men to spare the commons, but kill all the nobles and gentry. And he was more sorry for the death of his friend Montague than he was glad for the death of his foe Warwick, and had them both buried in state at Bisham priory.</p>
  <p>The very day of this victory Queen Margaret and her son

<pb id="p.335"  n="335"/>

 landed in the west, where they soon heard the news that
Warwick the <soCalled>"Kingmaker"</soCalled> was dead and King <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> a prisoner again.  Yet many men gathered to her out of the west and South Wales, and with Somerset, Devon, and other lords, she halted and stood at bay at Tewkesbury,
May 4, where King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> came up with her, and a battle was fought. The Lancastrians were drawn up <quote>"in a right evil place to approach as could well have been devised."</quote> But <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> had the better archers and gunners, and his brother Gloucester broke the Lancastrian line.
Somerset made a bold attack on the <placeName key="York">York</placeName>ist flank, but was himself set on from behind, whereat, believing that Lord
Wenlock had betrayed his plans, he struck him dead with his mace and rode angrily out of the battle. The Lancastrians having no good leader to rally them now turned in flight. The young prince was taken as he fled, and, though he cried to his brother-in-law Clarence for quarter, the servants of King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> and Gloucester stabbed him to death before their eyes. Many Lancastrian nobles were killed in the battle or beheaded afterwards, and Queen
Margaret herself was made prisoner.</p>
  <p>Before <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> could get back to London, Thomas, son of Neville Lord Falconbridge, with 300 soldiers from Calais and the levy of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, marched to London to deliver King
<persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>.  <quote>"But Lord Scales, keeper of the Tower, and the mayor, shut the gates against them, whereon Falconbridge shot his cannon into the city, and fired Aldgate and Bishopsgate. At which the commons were sore wroth and greatly moved against him, for if he had not burned the gates they would have let him in, spite of Lord Scales and the mayor.
And when he found he could not enter by force, he turned past the city and crossed the river at Kingston with 20,000 men, meaning to fight King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> on his way to London.
But Scales went to him and promised him and Farmer, the
Mayor of <placeName key="Canterbury">Canterbury</placeName>, that was with him, great things if they would turn homewards.   And forasmuch as fair words and promises make fools fain [glad], Falconbridge brought his men back to Blackheath, and then stole from them by night with his soldiers to their fleet that lay at
Sandwich. And when the <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>ishmen perceived that their captain was gone, they departed every man to his own home."</quote>  So King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> reached London safely, 21St
May.</p>
  <p>And that night King <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> died in the Tower, slain, as it was believed, by the Duke of Gloucester. His body, after

 lying in state in S. Paul's, was taken by boat to Chertsey, and there buried. King <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>'s life had been so sorrowful, and he himself had been so innocent of the wrongdoing that had brought civil war on in England, that many men held him for a martyr. He was a merciful man, pitiful even to dumb beasts, long-suffering, mild of speech, and patient in his troubles, pure and pious in his life, ever grieving over the sin and sorrow he could not stop. For, while he himself could not rule through his weak health and lack of strength, he was not able to give up his crown to another for fear of bringing on the war and bloodshed he did his best to stall off. In face he was comely and fair, in body tall, slender, and well made. His understanding was good, and he was a lover of learning, but the illness that came to him from his grandfather, the King of France, must have sorely hindered him even in his quiet studies.</p>
  <p>With <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName> and his son dead, and Margaret a prisoner,
<persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> was safe at last, but he took care not to give his foes any more chances of dethroning him. Henry Holland,
Duke of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, was put to death in prison. Falconbridge, who had given himself up and got a pardon, was beheaded by Gloucester. John de Vere, Earl of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, who held S.
Mich&#x00E6;l's Mount for six months, and yielded to save his life, was shut up in Hammes Castle, near Calais. George the archbishop was kept under guard at Guisnes. Only Jasper
Earl of Pembroke got awayto Brittanywith his young nephew
Richmond, the heir of the Beauforts of whom <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName> had foretold great things. <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> did his best to get
Duke Francis to give them up, but he would not trust the
English king's promises.  To lesser men <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> was always ready to give pardon, and even honour; thus he made Dr. Morton, the tutor of Margaret's son, Keeper of the Rolls, and he favoured Sir John Fortescue, <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>'s chancellor, who was the best lawyer in England.</p>
  <p>6. And now <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> began to make ready for an attack on France, for like <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry IV.</persName> he thought that it would be better to employ his nobles in fighting abroad than let them make war at home. To get moneyhe sent to many rich people through England, begging them to give or lend him money, which he called <quote>"Benevolence."</quote> And they lent it, rather than be taxed by Parliament, for they were afraid lest
Parliament should merely bring on quarrels and unsettle the peace. <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> got the help of the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany, and the Constable of S. Paul, and in June
<date value ="1475">1475</date> reached Calais with 5000 armoured knights and gentry,

<pb id="p.337"  n="337"/>



15,000 mounted archers, besides artillery and foot soldiers.
But Louis of France was too wise to fight him, and by crafty promises and gifts of money, he won over <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> and his nobles to make a truce at Peronne. <note place="foot" n="6">Peace with France, <date value ="1473">1473</date>.

At Pecquigny, on a bridge over the Somme, the two kings met and shook hands, and talked through a strong wooden grating set up between them. Louis paid <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> 75,000 crowns, and promised him 50,000 more every year, and engaged that his son should marry <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s daughter. Margaret was to be ransomed by her father for 50,000 crowns. So the kings parted in peace, and <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> came home satisfied that he was now able, without asking Parliament, <quote>" to live off his own :"</quote> he could also keep a guard of stout yeomen about him, which no king since <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName> had done. Some of his money he used in trade and made large profits ; and he also got much gain from fines laid upon rich law-breakers, and by forcing those of his tenants who had broken the terms of their holding to pay heavily for a new title. The clergy gave him money again and again rather than run the risk of the troubles that would follow fresh taxes.</p>
  <p>Soon after the death of Warwick in <date value ="1474">1474</date>, Richard of
Gloucester made up his mind to marry his youngest daughter
Anne, the widow of King <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry</persName>'s son, for he wished to share in the rich heritage left by the Kingmaker. Clarence, who hoped to keep it all for himself, did all he could to stop the match, even smuggling Lady Anne away in disguise. But Gloucester found her out, and married her in spite of Clarence, who then said that though he won the lady, he should have no share in the livelihood. But the king insisted that the heritage should be properly shared without further dispute. However, from this day forward
Clarence showed ill-will to both of his brothers, and <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> was Clarence's secret foe. In <date value ="1476">1476</date> Clarence's wife Isabel died, and he had one of her servants, Annkenet Twyndow, unjustly tried, and put to death, on the charge of having poisoned her. This made <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> angry, but he was still more displeased when at the death of Charles Duke of
Burgundy, his widow Margaret planned to marry their daughter, Mary heiress of Burgundy, to her favourite brother Clarence. The king refused to further this match, and put forward Antony, his queen's brother, for Mary's hand, which angered Clarence, and he withdrew from court for a while. But when his foes had two of his servants tried and put to death for working witchcraft against the lives

<note type="header"  place="head"><date value="1483">[1483.</date></note>
 of the king and others, he openly declared at the council that they were wrongly condemned. Gloucester and the
Woodvilles feared Clarence (for he was the next heir to <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName>, and would be Regent in case <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> should die before his sons were of age), and at their desire
Duke George was brought before the House of Lords.
The king himself accused his brother of trying to destroy his title and seize his crown. He was declared guilty in a bill, and put to death secretly in the Tower in February <date value ="1478">1478</date>.</p>

   Henceforward the Woodvilles and Gloucester shared the king's favour and the offices of state between them.
The king's mind was turned more and more towards a war abroad. In <date value ="1480">1480</date> he quarrelled with James III., and sent his brother Gloucester to the Borders with an army against him; and later on, in <date value ="1482">1482</date>, when James's brother Albany, who had been in exile in France, came back to claim the throne of Scotland, he took up his cause warmly. At
Fotheringay Albany swore to hold Scotland as a fief of England, to give up Berwick, and to marry Cicely <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s daughter, if <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> would help him to win the kingdom. In July
Albany and Gloucester, with a large army, beset
Berwick. King James set forth against them, but on the way the Earl of Angus seized him, hanged his chief counsellors, and bore him to Edinburgh a prisoner. Gloucester and Albany now left Berwick and hurried there also, and were received with joy; but, instead of taking the crown,
Albany set his brother free, and made terms for him with
England, on condition of yielding Berwick.  Balked in
Scotland, <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> and Gloucester now fell out with France in <date value ="1483">1483</date>, for Louis, breaking all his promises, betrothed the dauphin to Margaret of Burgundy's daughter, Mary.
<persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> called a parliament, got large supplies, and set about gathering an army for a second invasion of France, when he was suddenly stricken with fever at <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>. Feeling himself near death, he sent for his kinsfolk, and prayed them to live peaceably with one another after he was gone. On the
9th April he died, aged 41, and his sister's son, John de la
Pole, Earl of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, took his body to Windsor to be buried.</p>
   <p>Tall, stout, handsome, and skilled in all manly feats,
 <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> was as well gifted in mind as he was in body.
 Brave, quick, with all the powers of a good general (even in
 his boyhood winning every battle he ever fought), he had
 also many of the powers of a good captain-an open hand, a
 fair tongue, a ready ear, a cool brain. He loved his children,

<pb id="p.339"  n="339"/>

 was kind to his servants, did not forget his friends, and took pains to be courteous to all he met, rich or poor.
But he was thoroughly selfish, over fond of pleasure, over hasty in his suspicions, over greedy of wealth, and too lazy to look far forward in his plans. Hence he did less with his gifts than he might have done, and his successes seem rather strokes of luck than the result of his own work. He was neither so good a man of business, nor so ready to put himself to trouble as his brother <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>; but, on the other hand, he was not so cruel or greedy. He was not so subtle or persuasive as his brother George, but he was more true to his word and steadfast to his aim. He was popular all his life rather by reason of his beauty and bravery and easy good-nature, than for any trouble he took for his subjects' sake. The most kingly quality he had was his unflinching justice, and zeal for fair law. The unsettled state in which he left the realm at his death must be the chief condemnation of his rule.</p></div2>

                      <head>CHAPTER V: Edward V of Westminster 1483 and Richard III 1483</head>

       
  <p>1. When <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> died, his elder son, <persName key="Edward V.">Edward V.</persName> Prince of
Wales, was at Ludlow, where he had been sent to be brought up by his mother's brother, Anthony Lord Rivers, one of the most learned and accomplished noblemen of the day.
Most of the great lords of the Council, save the Dukes of
Gloucester and Buckingham, were in London. They at once met, and proclaimed the prince, who was then a handsome and clever boy of twelve years, King <persName key="Edward V.">Edward V.</persName> the Fifth.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="1">Gloucester made Protector. The friend of the Queen over-thrown, May and June <date value ="1483">1483</date>.</note>
  A regency was, of course, needful. The queen-mother's kinsmen, the Woodvilles and Greys, would have liked her to be regent.  But the Council, led by the personal friends of the late king-Lord Hastings the Captain of
Calais, Lord Stanley the Steward (who had married
Margaret Beaufort Countess of Richmond), and John
Duke of Suffolk, husband of Elizabeth, <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s sister-wished to make Gloucester Protector. They therefore forbade Lord Rivers to bring more than 2000 men up from Wales with the little king. Gloucester, who was in
<placeName key="York">York</placeName>shire when his brother died, set off to
London with a large body of men, and met Buckingham at

<pb id="p.340"  n="340"/>


Northampton. Here the two dukes laid their plans for the complete overthrow of the <quote>" queen's friends."</quote> At
Stony-Stratford, where they met the king, they struck the first blow, arresting Rivers and his nephew, Sir Richard Grey.
This sudden stroke frightened the queen, and she sought sanctuary at Westminster with her youngest son, Richard
Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, while her eldest son, the Marquis of Dorset fled from London.</p>
  <p>When the two dukes and the king reached London, where they were warmly welcomed, the Council met, and at
Hastings' proposal, named Gloucester Protector and Defender of the Realm. Parliament was called, and the crowning of the little king fixed for the 22d June. But Gloucester and Buckingham were not content with the power Council had given them. The queen's party were helpless, at their mercy, but the <quote>" king's friends,"</quote> led by Hastings, were still strong enough at the Council to check their plans.
They therefore made up their minds to fall upon him.
Gloucester quickly called out the levies of the northern shires, where he was held in much esteem, and sent orders to his friends Ratcliffe and the Earl of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> to have Lord Rivers and the other prisoners of that party beheaded without further delay. In all this he was able to act more secretly and swiftly by means of the regular post, or service of mounted messengers, which he had devised when he was carrying on the Scottish war for his brother.
On 13th June, when all was ready, the Protector came down to the Council, which met at the Tower, where the young king was lodged. At first he spoke pleasantly to them all, but then withdrew for a short time, to make sure that his soldiers were at hand. When he came back his face was dark, and, after sitting silent for a while, he cried, <q type="spoken">"What are they worthy of that compass my death ?"</q> <q type="spoken">"They are worthy of death,"</q> answered Hastings, <q type="spoken">"no matter who they be." </q>Then <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> bared his left arm (which was thinner and smaller than the other), declaring that it had been wasted by the witchcraft of Queen Elizabeth and Jane
Shore. The latter was a lady whom King <persName key="Edward V.">Edward V.</persName> had dearly loved, and who was befriended by Hastings after his death.  Hastings, willing to soothe the angry duke, answered gently, <q type="spoken">" My lord, if this be so, they are greatly to blame."</q> <q type="spoken">"What,"</q> cried Gloucester, <q type="spoken">"dost serve me with
<quote>'ifs </quote>' and <quote>' ans'</quote> ? I will prove my words upon thee, traitor !"</q> and with that he smote the board sharply with his hand.
The door flew open, and in rushed a band of guards, with

<pb id="p.341"  n="341"/>
 cries of<q type="spoken">" Treason !"</q> They laid hands on the Bishops of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> and Ely, and Lords Hastings and Stanley, the latter of whom was nearly killed by a blow from a sword. Gloucester bade them hale Hastings out and strike off his head at once, swearing by S. Paul that he would not break bread that day till he heard that he was dead. So as soon as he had been shrived by the first priest that could be found, the unlucky
Hastings was beheaded on a log of timber that lay on the green by S. Peter's in the Tower. The other prisoners were set in safe keeping. Then <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> and Buckingham called for armour from the stores in the Tower, and putting on the first brigandines [body-armour] that came to hand, met the mayor and aldermen, whom they had sent for, and told them that the Chamberlain and his friends had plotted to put them to death and seize the government, and that they had been obliged to punish them at once, lest further evil should come of it. The mayor and aldermen, who knew that the duke was a wise and careful statesman, and believed him to be a pious and unselfish man, were glad of the news, and put all their trust in the two dukes. <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s next step was to get Cardinal Bourchier to persuade the queen to give up the Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>. When she had done so, he brought him to his brother the king in the Tower with much state.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The Protector chosen King, <date value ="1483">1483</date>.</note>
  And now that he had no further danger to fear, for those whom he dreaded were either dead or in his power, while he had a large force of soldiers at his back ready to put down any rising against him, <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> began to take more open means to get himself made king. On Sunday 22nd June, Dr. Shaw, the mayor's brother, was set to preach at S. Paul's a sermon in which he said that, as the late king had been privately married to Eleanor Butler, daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury, before he wedded Lady Elizabeth Grey, his two sons
Edward and Richard were not born in lawful wedlock, and therefore had no right to the crown. He even went further, and to the great astonishment of the crowd of citizens who listened to him, set forth his doubts as to the lawful birth of the late King <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> himself, at the same time talking of the certainty every one must feel that Gloucester was his father's true heir. This sermon was followed up on the following Tuesday by a speech from the Duke of Buckingham at Guildhall to the mayor and chief citizens of London.
He repeated Dr. Shaw's arguments, said that the lords and commons of the north of England had sworn never to obey

<pb id="p.342"  n="342"/>


 <note type="header"  place="head"><placeName key="Richard III.">Richard III.</placeName></note>
 a king who was not lawfully born, noticed that Clarence's children were attainted by Act of Parliament, and declared that by right Duke <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> of Gloucester was the true heir to the crown of England and France. Upon this some of the assembly threw up their caps and hoods, with loud cries of<q type="spoken">" King <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> ! King <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>!"</q> Then the duke begged the mayor and company to go with him next morning to
Baynard's Castle, where the Protector was lodging, and beg him to take the crown that was his right. So, on the 25th
June, the duke, the mayor, with many lords, clergymen, and chief citizens, visited the Protector, and presented him with a signed roll, in which they prayed him in the name of the
Three Estates to be their king.  After a slight show of refusal <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> agreed to their wishes, and next day he walked to Westminster Hall in state to be proclaimed king. There he sat down on the judges' bench, and spoke to the lords and commons. He told them that he sat there because he wished to show that the king above all things should take care that the laws should be good laws and well kept.  On the 6th July <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> and Anne his wife were crowned by the Archbishop, Cardinal Bourchier, amid great pomp, the Duke of Buckingham and the Countess of Richmond being the train-bearers of the new king and queen. Most men were well pleased to be ruled by a man who had given proofs of his talents and knowledge of affairs, rather than have to face once more the many dangers and difficulties of a long minority. After the crowning of <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> nothing more was heard of the little princes, and what became of them was indeed never clearly known.
However, it was soon spread abroad that they were both dead, murdered in the Tower, as has ever since been most generally believed, by their uncle's order. And it is possible that the pity felt for their untimely fate, and the hatred it roused against the man who was looked upon as their merciless betrayer, were among the chief causes of his own downfall and death. Yet it does not seem that the princes' kindred or the great nobles believed at the time that
<persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> had killed his nephews, and for many years afterward, as will be seen, there were many who were sure that they had escaped from the Tower and were alive in hiding.</p>
  <p>3. <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> began his reign by rewarding his friends.
Lord Howard was made Duke of Norfolk and Earl Marshal and High Admiral, Buckingham Constable of England,
Lord Berkley Earl of Nottingham, Lord Lovel Chamberlain,
<placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> Warden of the Northern Marches. His

<pb id="p.343"  n="343"/>
 own son Edward, Earl of Salisbury, a boy of ten years old, he made Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester, and Lieutenant of Ireland, and at <placeName key="York">York</placeName> (which he visited in great state), knighted him on the 8th September. <note place="foot" n="3">Buckingham's rebellion and fall.</note>
But Buckingham was not satisfied with what he had got by his work; like Warwick he had made a king, and the king when made did not care to be ruled by him.
When he claimed the earldom of Hereford, which had fallen into the crown, as the heir of the house of Bohun,
<persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> refused it. Buckingham at once began treating with the Woodvilles and Greys, and with the remains of the old Lancastrian party, the Courtnays, Bishop Morton, and the friends of the exiled Earl of Richmond. At first their plan had been to rise for the little King <persName key="Edward V.">Edward V.</persName>
But when it was bruited about that he and his brother were dead, by Morton's advice they determined to make Richmond king, and marry him to the Lady Bessy, eldest daughter of <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>, so as to join the two houses of
<placeName key="York">York</placeName> and Beaufort against <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>. The Stanleys, who were now in high favour with the king again, held back, for though Lord Stanley would gladly have seen his wife's son on the throne, he did not care to risk his life and lordship to profit Buckingham, who would, of course, have become
Richmond's chief minister. The secret of the plot was well kept. On the 18th October all the southern shires rose from
<placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> to Devon; Buckingham set up the new king's banner at Brecknock, and marched down to the Severn; Richmond himself set sail from S. Malo for the south coast of England.
<persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> took swift means to quell the rebellion. He proclaimed death to the leaders and pardon to their followers.
He broke down the Severn bridges so as to stop Buckingham, and then hurried in person to the south-west to meet
Richmond as soon as he should land. However, Richmond's fleet was driven north by a heavy gale, and when he found himself alone off Poole, he dared not risk the venture, and put back to Brittany. Buckingham was kept back by the rising of the Severn, which made the fords too deep to ride. The rebels in the south-west, left leaderless, scattered and went home. And when Buckingham found that he had failed, he too fled in disguise to the house of one of his servants named
Bannister, who betrayed him to <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> for a great price.
In vain Buckingham prayed for an interview with the king, his head was struck off in Salisbury market-place. At
<placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> did not even spare his own sister's husband,
Sir Thomas St. Leger, but he forgave all the commonalty.</p>

  When he got back to London at Christmas a parliament was called, 23d January, which decreed <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s title good, as well by right of blood and inheritance as by lawful choice, hallowing, and crowning, attainted the
Duke of Buckingham, the Earls of Richmond and Pembroke, the Countess of Richmond, the Marquis of Dorset, and others. This parliament also passed many useful Acts touching law, trade, and tax-collecting; by the Statute of
Fines it enabled men to make good against all the world their title to the lands they held, a matter of much moment at a time when so much land had passed by forfeiture and attainder from hand to hand; by the Statute of Uses it forbade secret conveyances of land, and made the person for whose use land was held by the king the real owner in the eye of the law ; by the article against <soCalled>"benevolences"</soCalled> it did away for ever with these new and unlawful inventions.  The king also gave the clergy a charter at this parliament, confirming all the rights his brother granted them in <date value ="1462">1462</date>.</p>
  <p><persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> also strove to make a fresh settlement for the crown, for when, in the midst of his success, his only son died, April <date value ="1484">1484</date>, he adopted as his heir first Edward Earl of Warwick, the son of Clarence, and afterward John de la Pole, Earl of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, another nephew. Anne, John's sister, he proposed to marry to the prince of Scotland by the treaty of Nottingham, September, when he made a truce with King James. The Scots were glad of this peace, for the English fleet had driven their cruisers off the four seas, and now that Albany (who had been sheltered and helped by <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> when he quarrelled with his brother, and returned to England in <date value ="1483">1483</date>) had failed in the Raid of
Lochmaben, and sought refuge in France, the English had no reasons for enmity with them. March 16, <date value ="1485">1485</date>, <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s wife Anne, who had been long ailing, died, and now he persuaded Elizabeth, the dowager-queen, to throw over the schemes of those who would have married her daughter
Lady Bessy to Richmond, and promise her to himself-a plan which Lady Bessy herself, whatever she thought secretly, openly approved of. But many of <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s best friends tried to dissuade him from it, and he at last had to contradict it to the London citizens. However, before the final steps could be taken to bring about the marriage,
<persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s own end came.  When Buckingham fell Lord
Stanley became Constable of England, his brother Sir
William  Justiciar of North Wales, and Henry <persName key="Percy, Henry">Percy</persName>

Earl of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName> Chamberlain. But whether they dreaded the craft of the king, or hoped to get even higher rewards from his successes, certain it is that they entered secretly into a second plot for setting Richmond on the throne. After getting assurances of their help, the young earl sailed from Harfleur, with some French ships, and some 3000 Norman soldiers aboard, and slipping past
<persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s fleet, landed at Milford Haven August 7.
<persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>, who had known of his coming, though he was not aware of the treachery of his ministers, had an army ready to meet him, and a large treasure raised by loans on pledge among his richer friends. He now issued a proclamation. in which he says that certain rebels and traitors, men of evil life, had come to attack England, having chosen for a captain <quote>"one Harry Tydder of base descent :"</quote> that these men had promised the King of France to give up all the English rights over Guienne, Anjou, and Normandy in return for his help to them; that they had shared among themselves the lordships of many of the clergy and nobles of England, and that they would surely take these, and overturn the laws of
England and all men's rights if they could; that therefore he, <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>, who would put himself to all labour and pain for the comfort and safety of his subjects, bade all men be ready in arms to resist the said rebels, enemies, and traitors.</p>

  The royal forces gathered at Leicester, Northumberland, and the northern lords and gentry from the north,

Doubting his excuse, <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> seized his son
Lord Strange, who confessed that he and his uncle Sir William and others had sworn to help Richmond, but held out that his father knew nothing of the plot. The king bade him write to his father that he must bring his men up at once, or his son should die. All the while <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> was pushing for Leicester; on his road he was joined by Rees ap Thomas with his
Welsh spearmen, by Sir Gilbert Talbot with the men of
Shrewsbury, and by the friends of the Earl of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> and of Sir John Savage. But he agreed with Sir William

When <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> saw the <soCalled>" red coats "</soCalled> and <soCalled>" hartsheads "</soCalled> of the

But Sir William Harrington pointed out that the vanguards were beginning to fight, and begged the king to wait till he had all the three Stanleys in his power, and judge them   together.   So the young man escaped death.   The battle began hotly:-

But the day went against <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>, for <persName key="Percy, Henry">Percy</persName>, who was in the plot with Stanley, gave way before the Welsh, who fought under the dragon banner of Wales, and though

For when he saw that the day was lost he spurred his steed,

But he was almost alone, and before he could kill <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> he was overpowered and slain.
Lord Stanley picked up the crown which had been stricken from the fallen king's helmet, and had fallen in a hawthorn bush, and taking Richmond to a little hillock close by, set it on his head amid shouts of <q type="spoken">" King Harry, King Harry!"</q>
The body of <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> was stripped and borne across a herald's horse, like a dead calf, to Leicester, where it was buried in the Grey Friars church. Brackenbury, Ratcliffe,
Lord Ferrers, and Theobald, King <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s standard-bearer (who clung to his banner when he could no longer stand for his wounds), died with their master. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> lost scarce one man of note.</p>
  <p><persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> was one of the most able kings that ever reigned in England, and so far as can be seen his rule deserves high praise. With all the talents and far more perseverance than his brother Edward, he took especial care of police, justice, and trade. The one parliament of his reign did more to better the laws than any since the death of
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName> He was never tired of looking into his subjects' grievances himself, and in redressing these he showed uprightness and kindliness. He had a higher sense of the royal honour than his brother, and he had been angry when
<persName key="Edward V.">Edward V.</persName> had taken bribes from the French king at Peronne rather than fight for his claims on France. He had never changed sides like the <quote>" false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,"</quote> but had shown such a strong and unyielding party-feeling, that his foes set down to him the harshest measures that had been taken against the Red Rose. Whether he really did the deeds of which he is accused is not certain, but there is nothing in what is known of him to render his guilt unlikely.
Unbounded selfishness and keen ambition, careful of the end but careless of the means to gain that end, appear in the character of many princes of his day, and might and often did exist along with the personal good-nature, gallantry,

 generosity, high ability and outward strictness of life which
<persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> undoubtedly showed. He was a persuasive speaker, a lover of music, and art, and learning, and delighted in rich clothes, shows, and ceremonies, though his own dress was simple and good. He was, like all his family, handsome of face, and in spite of having one shoulder slightly higher than the other, and the left arm weaker and smaller than the right, he is said by those who knew him to have been a singularly active, agile, and powerful man. In his plan of governing by men such as Catesby, Ratcliffe, and
Lovel, whom he could put up and set down as he liked, in his determination to quell the turbulence of his nobles by strict laws against men keeping large numbers of armed retainers or making partisans by the giving of badges, in the plans of finance by which he strove to lighten the burdens of the merchant, yeoman, and artisan, he improved upon his brother's policy, and laid down the lines upon which the Tudors ruled England for sixscore years to the people's liking and their own good-fortune-yet he has left his own name to become a by-word and a reproach.</p>

  <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>'s first act was to send the Lady Bessy, his betrothed, and her cousin Edward of Warwick, Clarence's son, from the north, where they had been living in safe custody, to the Tower.  He himself soon followed them to London, which he entered in great state amid much rejoicing on a Saturday, a day he always fancied brought him good fortune. But he was not able to be crowned for some weeks, because of the sweating sickness, which was raging very badly at the time in the city. After the coronation, when he made his father's brother Jasper Duke of Bedford, his step-father Stanley Earl of Derby, and his friend Sir
Edward Courtnay Earl of Devon, he called a parliament.
It met and reversed the attainders of the new king's mother, kinsmen, and friends, annulled the Acts which declared <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry IV.</persName>, <persName key="Henry V.">V.</persName>, and <persName key="Henry VI.">VI.</persName> usurpers and
<persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s children base born, and passed a bill attainting King <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> and his chief counsellors. It

 was also settled <quote>" that the inheritance of the crown should rest, remain, and abide in King <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName> and the heirs of his body,"</quote> and both Houses prayed the new king to marry the Lady Elizabeth of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>. To this he agreed, and after proclaiming a pardon to all who had offended him, he wedded the Lady Bessy on the 18th January.
Knowing that <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName> had been well liked in the north, he now resolved to follow his example and make a progress through his kingdom  from  London to <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, redressing grievances, and meeting all who wished to see him or speak with him. On the road he was annoyed by the first of the many risings which made his reign almost as troublesome as that of <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry IV.</persName> Lord Lovel broke out of sanctuary, raised a band of soldiers, and was about to waylay the king on his road, while the Staffords (cousins of the late Duke of Buckingham) seized Worcester. But Bedford and the northern levies scattered Lovel's men, though he himself escaped to Flanders to <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s sister, the Duchess of
Burgundy, <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>'s deadliest foe. The Staffords were easily put down. In England the Yorkists were too disheartened by their late defeats to risk further misfortune; but in
Ireland, where they had not suffered for the cause, and where the government was wholly in their, hands, there were many eager to strike another blow for the White
Rose.  The Fitzgeralds had been put into power by
Richard of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, and his son Richard, in <date value ="1484">1484</date>, had named their head, the Earl of Kildare, Lord-Deputy for life. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName> naturally leant towards the rival house, that of the Butlers, who were staunch Lancastrians; and though he dared not overthrow the Fitzgeralds, he at once sent over his uncle Jasper as Lord-Lieutenant to look after his interests. Kildare accordingly fell readily into a scheme formed at the court of Burgundy for the new king's overthrow.</p>
  <p>2. In February <date value ="1487">1487</date> there came to Waterford a priest,
Richard Symons, with a handsome boy of ten years old, who he said was Edward of Warwick, son of Clarence, and heir of the English crown. They were welcomed and acknowledged by the Fitzgeralds, and the news sent to the
Yorkists in England. John Earl of <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName>, who had his own claims to the crown, travelled secretly to Flanders, and thence, by the help of the duchess, soon sailed to Dublin with Lord Lovel and a number of trained arcbusiers under
Martin Swart, a veteran captain. The plot was now ripe on
May 5 ; the boy was crowned in Dublin Cathedral with a

 circle of silver taken from the head of the Virgin's image, and borne through the streets after the Irish fashion on the shoulders of the chief of the Darcies.
<note place="foot" n="2">The Lambert Simnel rebellion crushed at Stoke, June 15, <date value ="1487">1487</date>.</note>
They then resolved to cross into
England and attack King <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> there, and on
June 4 landed at Foudray. Meanwhile <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> had made ready to resist his enemies; he brought the real
Edward of Warwick out of the Tower, so that people might see for themselves that the boy the Irish crowned was a counterfeit; he levied troops, and he went a pilgrimage to
Our Lady of Walsingham to pray for help in his troubles.
The earls got as far south as Stoke, though their snowball did not gather as it went, and few Englishmen joined them.
Here the king met them, and after three hours' hard fighting won the day. Martin Swart and his <soCalled>" merry men,"</soCalled> Kildare and his Irish gallow-glasses, <placeName key="Lincoln">Lincoln</placeName> and the English Yorkists, were all killed on the field. Lovel swam the Trent and reached his home, where he hid in a secret chamber underground for some time, till of wounds or want of food he died. The priest and the pretended Edward were taken.
The former was sent to prison, but the latter <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> pardoned and made a turnspit in his kitchen, whence he afterwards rose to be a falconer in the Royal Mews. It was found out that his real name was Lambert, and that he was the son of Thomas Simnel, organ-maker, of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>. He was taken and trained to act as he did, because the Yorkists feared that if they chose Edward as king while he was in
<persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>'s hands, the king would at once put him to death; whereas, if they set up a false Edward (whom they could easily get rid of if they were able to overthrow <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>), the king would be obliged, in his own interest, to keep the true
Edward alive, to show the people that he was not with the rebels. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> punished those whom he found to have been in the secret of the plot by heavy fines; and to show the Yorkists that he did not mean to persecute them, he had his queen crowned with much show of state, and sent to Ireland to pardon the Fitzgeralds on condition of their swearing to be faithful to him.</p>
   <p>3. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> now busied himself with foreign affairs, and
 especially with those of Scotland and Brittany.  With
 James III. of Scotland he was good friends, and there was
 even some talk of the Scottish king marrying Elizabeth,
 widow of <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>, and of two of the Scottish princes
 wedding two of her unmarried daughters. But the Scottish
 nobles of the party of Albany rebelled, and seized the king's

On June 11, <date value ="1488">1488</date>, the royal army was utterly defeated, and James III. killed as he fled from the battle. The new king was under the sway of men who disliked <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> heartily, as was soon to be seen, but the old friends of James III., who took refuge in England, were always ready to forward the schemes of the English king, by whom they hoped to regain power some day in their own land. As for Brittany, Duke Francis was now old, and the young French king, <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles VIII.</persName>, the
Duke of Orleans, and Maximilian, King of the Romans, were all hoping to succeed to his heritage, since he had no heir-male. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> was called upon by both Francis and
<persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName> for help, but he did not wish to risk his troops abroad, or to spend money on other people's behalf. He therefore made the war a pretext for getting Parliament to give him a large subsidy, and sent Edward Earl Rivers with a few men to Brittany, promising further help later. But his craft overreached itself and brought him trouble, for the people in <placeName key="York">York</placeName>shire and Durham said openly that they had endured of late years a thousand miseries, and neither could nor would pay the subsidy. But the king answered them that he would not bate a penny of what had been granted him by Parliament. Thereupon they rose under
Sir John Egremont and John a' Chamber and killed the
Earl of <placeName key="Northumberland">Northumberland</placeName>, whom they hated both for his harshness to them in levying the tax and his treachery to their old favourite King <placeName key="Richard III.">Richard III</placeName>. However, this rising was soon put down by Thomas, Earl of <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName> (son to the Duke of Norfolk, who died at Bosworth), who took and hanged John a' Chamber and many of his followers. In
Brittany too things fell out ill, for the Bretons were badly beaten at S. Aubin, where Rivers was killed, and on Francis' death a few weeks later the French overran the greater part of his duchy. So angry were the English that <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> was obliged to send an army under Sir Robert Willoby to
Brittany to help the heiress Anne, and another under Lords d'Aubigny and Morley to Flanders to aid Maximilian.-At
Dixmude the English archers gained a splendid victory, storming the French camp and killing 8000 men, for they would give no quarter, as their leader, the young Lord
Morley, had been killed. One archer, John Pearson, who was lamed by a cannon-shot, shot his arrows as he lay till the
Frenchmen fled, and then he cried to one of his fellows,

 saying,<soCalled> 'Take thou these six arrows that I have left, and follow thou the chase, for I cannot.' </soCalled>At Niewport too they beat off the French Captain Descordes, who had said that he would be content to lie in hell seven years if he might win Calais from the English ! This battle brought about a peace between <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName> and Maximilian and Anne. But the King of the Romans was too laggard a lover to carry off his bride while he had the chance, and <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName> forced upon her a treaty by which she was to marry him instead, and promised to leave her domains to the King of France or his heir. This marriage took place in December <date value ="1491">1491</date>, and
Maximilian was doubly angered at it, for he not only lost his own bride, but his daughter Margaret, who had been betrothed to <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName>, lost her bridegroom. The English again called out for war, and <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> raised large sums by
Benevolences, in levying which Morton, <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>'s Chancellor, gave those who should gather them the famous instructions that have since been known as his fork or crutch-to wit, if they saw any gentry sparing in their way of life, they should tell them that since they must be saving, they must needs have something to lend the king ; and if they met any that lived richly, they were to say that since they could afford to spend so much, they must be well able to help the king.  With the money so got <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> called out a great army and landed at Boulogne, October <date value ="1492">1492</date>. But all his warlike show was merely meant to frighten <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName> into paying a good round sum for peace; and as soon as Lord d'Aubigny had got an offer of &#x00A3;127,666, <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> closed with it, and blaming the delays of Maximilian for his own inaction, went home, as <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> had done after the treaty of
Peronne. He had indeed a foe to cope with more to be dreaded than <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName>, and it is possible that he was content with less money than he would otherwise have asked for that he might have his hands free to deal with this new danger.</p>

Richard Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, and prayed for help from the Earls of Kildare and Desmond, the chiefs of the Fitzgeralds. He alleged that he had been saved from the Tower when his brother, <persName key="Edward V.">Edward V.</persName>, was killed by King <persName key="Richard III.">Richard</persName>'s murderers, and that he was now come to claim his heritage. <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles VIII.</persName> sent for him when he was at war with <persName key="Henry VII.">King Henry</persName>", and treated him as the true prince; and at the French court manly outlawed and exiled

Yorkists drew to him. After the treaty of Boulogne <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName> sent him into Flanders to the Duchess Margaret, who acknowledged him as her nephew, did him all princely honour, calling him the White Rose of England, and giving him a guard of thirty halbardiers clad in murrey
[mulberry red] and blue. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> published an account of the murder of the princes, drawn, as he said, from the confessions of the murderers, Dighton and Tyrrell, in order to prove that Richard was an impostor. He also sent spies to
Ireland, Flanders, and France, to find out all he could both about the young man himself and those with whom he was in correspondence in England. Moreover, he bought over
Sir Robert Clifford, who betrayed to him the names of many who had promised Richard help. He sent to Flanders too, and begged the Archduke Philip, Maximilian's son, to turn the young man out of his domains; and upon his answer that the dowager-duchess could do as she liked in her own land, <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> banished all the Flemings from England, and moved the regular mart or staple of the English wool trade from Antwerp to Calais, which was a great blow to the trade of the Low Countries. He then dealt his first stroke at the new <placeName key="York">York</placeName>ist party by arresting Lord Fitzwalter and several northern gentlemen and clergymen, who were tried, condemned, and, save Fitzwalter himself and three others, pardoned. To Ireland he sent pardons as before
(for the Archbishop of Dublin and the Earl of Desmond had agreed to join Richard), and he took care for the better government of that country, by sending his trusty minister,
Sir Edward Poynings, as deputy. Sir Edward sent Gerald
Earl of Kildare over to England, to be examined by the
Council, who were satisfied of his innocence. He also got the Irish Parliament to pass the Acts known as Poyning's
Laws, by which the Acts of the English Parliament were of force in Ireland, and the Irish Parliament was forbidden to pass any Acts that should not be approved of by the Privy
Council. These Acts made future Irish parliaments depend almost wholly upon the English government of the day.
The king now made his second son <persName key="Henry VIII.">Henry</persName> Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, showing thereby his contempt of the claims of Richard.
After the Christmas feasts were over the court moved to the Tower, and there, early in January, Sir Robert Clifford came to beg his pardon of the king, and to accuse Sir
William Stanley, the Lord Chamberlain, of treason. He was at once arrested, confessed his guilt, and in February executed. It was said that the first thing that led Stanley

   <note type="header"  place="head">[<dateRange from="1495" to="1497">1495-1497</dateRange>.]</note>

  -who had been the chief person in gaining the king his
  crown-to wish to overthrow him, was the king's refusal to
  make him Earl of Chester, a title he kept for his own eldest
  son Arthur. By Stanley's death <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> got  &#x00A3; 40,000 (the
  plunder of Bosworth), besides great estates that had once belonged to his old friend the Duke of Buckingham. The
  Parliament which <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> held in the year <date value ="1495">1495</date> was one of the
  most eventful of his reign. It passed an Act by which no
  one who served the king for the time being, whether he be the
  lawful king or no, shall be liable to be attainted as a traitor,
  or suffer any vexatious trouble or loss (a very welcome law
  to those who had been in any former king's service). It
  allowed persons too poor to buy writs to have them freely
  without fee. It ordered that judges should have power
  to fine jurymen giving untrue verdicts. The royal household was to cost no more than &#x00A3;12,000 a year.  At
  last Richard sailed from Flanders, and landed a party
  of men at Deal. Here the Mayor of Sandwich and the
  Sheriff of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> fell upon them and took some eightscore,
  who were sent to London, railed in ropes like a team
  of cart-horses, to be hanged and set on gibbets along the
  coast of <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName>, for a warning to their friends. Richard himself sailed on to Ireland, and, being joined by many of the
  Fitzgeralds, laid siege to Waterford (a town with whom they
  had a long-standing feud), but in vain; so that being invited by King James IV. he thought best to go to him, hoping
  to get better help than he could look for in Ireland.</p>
    <p>James not only received Richard well, but made a league
  with him, gave him his own cousin Catherine Gordon,
  daughter of the Earl of Huntly, to wife, and in <date value ="1496">1496</date> invaded
  England on his behalf. A proclamation was put forth in
  the name of Richard the Fourth, King of England, declaring
  <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> a usurper, and offering a reward of L1000 for his
  head, accusing him of putting to death Richard's true
  subjects, and governing by means of Bishop Fox, Simpson,
  and <quote>" such other caitiffs and villains born,"</quote> and promising
  that the King of Scots would go back without reward as
  soon as <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> was overthrown. But after wasting Northumberland, a course against which Richard protested, the
  Scots were forced to retire, for no one would join them,
  and they were afraid to risk a pitched battle. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>,
  however, did not spare pains to forestall a fourth invasion.
  He made a treaty with the Archduke of Flanders, known
  as the Magnus Intercursus, by which trade was to be
  resumed, and each side agreed to expel rebels against the

<pb id="p.355"  n="355"/>


 other taking refuge in their domains, thus closing a refuge against Richard. He also got Parliament to give him a fresh subsidy of &#x00A3;120,000 to make the north safe against Scottish attacks. But this tax was resisted in
Cornwall by the people, who were told by Mich&#x00E6;l Joseph, the farrier of Bodmin, and Thomas Flammock, a lawyer, that they were not bound to be taxed for the northern counties, whose need should be met by scutage and the other feudal dues. This encouraged them to rise and march to London to punish Archbishop Morton, who laid on this tax. So, armed with bills, bows, and clubs, they marched in good order to <placeName key="Kent">Kent</placeName> under Lord Audley,
Mich&#x00E6;l, and Thomas, and camped on Blackheath. <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> sent <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName> to guard the north, and himself, with the Earls of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, Essex, and Suffolk, and Lord d'Aubigny, made ready to defend London. June 17th, <date value ="1497">1497</date>, after some desperate fighting-for the Cornishmen were famed for their strength and skill in archery, and it was noted after the fight that their arrows were some inches longer than those of the royal soldiers-d'Aubigny won the day for the king, killing 2000 rebels, and taking Lord Audley, Mich&#x00E6;l, and
Thomas prisoners. These three were executed in London, and the rest pardoned. <placeName key="Surrey">Surrey</placeName> on his side drove back the
Scottish host, and carried the war into Scotland. So that
James was not unwilling to make peace and send Richard away. Accordingly in July, Richard, with his wife and a few faithful followers, set out for Ireland in ships which
James had given him. From here, urged by his counsellor lawyer Ashley, he crossed to Cornwall, where the late rising showed how little <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> was loved, and being well received there, led about 3000 men to beset <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>. But the king's friends now gathered in numbers against him, so he resolved to leave <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName>, which he could not take, and march on to the east. At Taunton his army, 7000 strong, faced the royal troops; but at midnight, before the battle, his heart failed him, and he fled secretly to Bewley, where he took sanctuary. His followers, left to their fate, disbanded.
The king forgave the Cornishmen, after punishing them with heavy fines; the townsmen of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> he rewarded and thanked, giving the mayor his own sword as a token of his esteem. Richard's wife was taken at St. Mich&#x00E6;l's Mount, and <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>, touched by her beauty and faithfulness, made her lady-in-waiting to his own queen.

Englishmen at Antwerp and other towns in the Low
Countries, whence he had gone to Portugal and taken service with Sir Piers Vacz da Cunha, and finally came with a Breton, Pregent Meno, to Cork, where he was persuaded to call himself the Duke of <placeName key="York">York</placeName>. Next year, <date value ="1498">1498</date>,

 taxes he advised his master to raise, and he made the monks angry by an inspection he made of the minsters and convents, where indeed he found much that needed correction and reform.  <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName>'s wife did not long outlive her son, dying in <date value="1503">1503</date>.  And now that he had overcome nearly all his difficulties, the king's own health began to fail, growing worse and worse till his death.  Yet he did not withdraw from business, but employed himself in treaties with foreign princes abroad, and in gathering treasures at home.  In <date value="1503">1503</date> he got Pope <persName key="Alexander VI.">Alexander VI.</persName>, who had sent him a sword and cap of honour, to lessen the privileges of sanctuary, which had little by little become a stumbling block in the path of justice, whereby offenders too often escaped the rightful punishment of their crimes.  In <date value="1504">1504</date> another busy Parliament met, in which large grants were made to the king; corporations, guilds, and fellowships were forbidden to make by-laws without the assent of the Chancellor or justices; maintenance and giving of liveries and badges were ordered to be judged in the Council or by the King's Bench.  In
<date value="1506">1506</date>, as the King of Castile, <persName key="Philip I.">Philip</persName> the Archduke, was passing
Dover Channel with his wife Joan, they were driven into
Falmouth by stress of weather.  <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> at once bid them to his court, and they were not able to refuse.  <quote>"Two miles out of Windsor they met, and <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> received <persName key="Philip I.">Philip</persName> in the goodliest manner, and each of them embraced the other in his arms.

Margaret as bride, and the English king thereupon gave up this match, and sought to wed Joan Queen of Castile,
<persName key="Philip I.">Philip</persName>'s widow, although she was mad. The marriage between <persName key="Charles VIII.">Charles</persName> and Mary also fell through, though there was much time spent in bargaining over it by the king's agents abroad. At home <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> worked chiefly through two of his councillors, Robert Dudley, a Warwickshire squire, and
Richard Empson, the son of a sievemaker. Bold men, careless of scorn, hated by the people as the king's <quote>"horse-leeches and skin-shearers,"</quote> they busied themselves in filling the treasury and their own pockets, by making men pay heavy fees for the privilege of being tried; by extorting large sums for charters of pardon; by fining jurymen for their sentences; by setting men (whom the people nick-named promoters and questmongers) to seek out those who had broken the laws in petty ways, and either frighten them into paying highly to be let off, or condemn them without mercy to excessive fines; by making corporations and guilds give enormous sums to allow their privileges and by-laws to stand. By which unjust doings the king, at his death, had more than &#x00A3;1,800,000 gathered in secret places under his own key. Twice when he felt ill and near his end, he showed that he knew of the evil ways by which his servants had amassed money for him, for he ordered the petty debtors who filled the prisons to be set free, and bade the judges hear complaints against his councillors. And on his deathbed he wished what he had unjustly gotten to be given back, but as long as he was well he did not check the wickedness going on in his name. On April 22, <date value ="1509">1509</date>, he died at Richmond, in the palace he had built. He lies in the fair chapel he made for his tomb in Westminster
Abbey.</p>
   <p>An exile or a prisoner from the age of five till he won his crown, <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry</persName> grew up serious, silent, suspicious, and reserved, neither hating nor loving, but using his fellow-creatures with no closer care than his own well-being, no deeper religion than a regard for his own soul. He is described as of middle height, spare built, with a long pale face, grey eyes, dark brown hair, and a red wart on the right cheek.
He loved fine clothes and glittering pageants.  In his search for wealth, it is worth noting that he risked a little money in sending Sebastian Gabato on a voyage to the
New World.</p>

  <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1"> Power of the Council. The Star Chamber.</note>
  During this century the constitution was little changed.
The long wars abroad and troubles at home left the king and nobles scant space for reforms. The rulers of the house of Lancaster made a show of great respect to Parliament, but it was under <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName> that the power of voting in the counties was denied to all those who had not a freehold worth 40s. a year. The wish to let old disputes sleep made the first king of the house of <placeName key="York">York</placeName> call as few parliaments as possible, and indeed men wanted neither fresh taxes nor new laws, but a strong prince who would see the old laws kept, and be mindful that justice was done as swiftly and cheaply as might be to rich and poor alike. To secure this, the king's
Council held many sittings, and in the end one of its committees, to which the special duty of seeing to the keeping of the peace and the upholding of justice was trusted, became a regular court, with rules and rights of its own, under the name of the Star Chamber. It got this name from the blue star-painted roof of the room at Westminster in which it was held. Just as the Chancellor gave redress in his court to-those who could not get it from the common law-courts in certain cases when their property was injured, so the Star Chamber took up those cases of criminal wrongdoing which the common law-courts could not or would not attend to. And those who strove to prevent a man from getting justice, or banded together against their neighbours, or fostered quarrels and kept up feuds, or, as jurymen, gave verdicts against the evidence they had heard and the oath they had sworn, were brought before the Star Chamber and fined or imprisoned. But the Star Chamber could not touch a man's life or lands as the common law-courts could, because its sentence was not given by a judge according to the finding of a jury in the old English fashion, but settled by the votes of the councillors upon their secret examination of the prisoner and the witnesses in the manner of the Roman Law. Now that the Council was so strong, little by little it began to use the bad foreign plan of torturing prisoners to make them tell what they knew, and it is said that the Duke of <placeName key="Exeter">Exeter</placeName> started it, for he had seen it used in France. But as yet none were tortured who were not open evildoers; and so, though the duke got



<pb id="p.360" n="360"/> as ill a name for cruelty to prisoners as Tiptoft had won for maiming and mocking dead men's bodies, men did not blame the Council, and at this time were glad that the
Star Chamber was strong and active enough to deal with many a powerful law-breaker, who, under the weak rule of
<persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName>, would have got off scot-free.</p>
  <p>2.<note place="foot" n="2">The Church rich and not reforming itself.</note>
  As for the Church, the bishops and abbots and priors withstood all ideas of reform from without, and were too busy over fighting heresy, managing their growing property, and working the Church courts, to bestir themselves in the matter. But though the failure of Sir John Oldcastle's plan made it dangerous to meddle with
Lollardy, there were not a few who, like Sir
John Fastolf, saw that things could not go on so with the Church for ever. We find that there was growing up, in quiet, a deep discontent against the greedy courts, the worldly lives, and the enormous and ill-spent wealth of the clergy. The bishops met this not only by burning heretics, but by founding colleges at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> and
Cambridge, where the young clergy might be brought up in their own views. Gascoyne, Chancellor of the University of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, has spoken plainly upon the evils of the Church in his day in his note-book, and the popular songs show small respect for the friars.  Even the learned book of
Bishop Peacock against <persName key="Wyclif, John">Wycliff</persName>was so bold in starting new views on the faith and life of the Church, that he was deprived of his bishopric, and imprisoned as a heretic in <date value ="1459">1459</date>.</p>
   <p>3. The fifteenth century was a flourishing time for English farmers and merchants. The seasons were fair, the crops good, the seas were safer than before, and the demand for
English goods never slackened. The customary rents being now paid at a fixed sum of money instead of in kind [that is, in corn or cattle or labour], and the practice largely used by landlords of stocking and letting small farms to leaseholders at low rates, the yeoman, copyholder, and farmer were all able to profit by the good years, and glad to do their best by their land, knowing that their labour would benefit themselves.  By <date value ="1450">1450</date> the land was better tilled and yielded larger crops than before the Black Death.</p>
   <p><note place="foot" n="3">Prosperity of yeomen, craftsmen, and merchants.</note>
   In the towns, in spite of the losses by war and pirates, and the foolish debasement of the money by
<persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName>, <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName>, and <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> (which, of course, tended to hamper foreign trade), merchants and workmen did well. The craftguilds were now at the height of their power and usefulness,

<pb id="p.361" n="361"/> they secured their members against many of the misfortunes that might befall them, encouraged self-help and kindly fellowship, rewarded thrift, kept prices steady, prevented sudden transfers of labour from trade to trade, discouraged extravagant profits, and kept a watch over the conduct of the craftsmen and the kind of work they turned out. Our foreign trade also largely increased, as might be guessed from the treaties of commerce with Brittany, Castile, Portugal, Florence, Flanders, and the Hansa or Trading League of the Baltic towns, made by <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry IV.</persName>, Edward
IV., and <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName> Shipbuilding flourished, and John
Taverner of Hull launched the biggest vessel yet built in
England, for his use in the North Sea trade. All kinds of ships (carvels, barges, balingers, cogs, and crayers) sail from
English ports with wool, corn, lead, tin, honey, and hides, and even such manufactured goods as saddlery, hardware, and guns. They come back to England laden with wine, wood, alum, bowstaves, spices, and dried fruits. Not onlydid
English goods fill the great fairs of Brabant, Flanders, and
Zealand, but London and Southampton were marts to which the long galleys of Florence and Venice brought paper,
Greek wine and sugar, Eastern stuffs and silk, turquoises, and balas rubies, which were paid for partly in wool and partly in silver. New trades grew up, Ireland supplied furs and dried hake and strong coarse cloths-frize and serges andfalding. In <date value ="1414">1414</date> William Canning and other northern merchants brought the Iceland trade from the east coast to <placeName key="Bristol">Bristol</placeName>, and, in spite of the Danes' ill-will, soon got hold of the market there, buying stock-fish and eider-down and brimstone, and selling wine and grain and timber in return.
The Merchant Adventurers had their factory, or tradinghouse at Bergen, side by side with that of the Easterlings.
The English kings began to keep up a fleet; <persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName>, like his great-grandfather, <persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>, built a large ship, called the Grace Dieu, and the Lord High Admiral, who had a court of his own to try crimes committed at sea, was one of, the chief officers of the Crown.</p>
  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="4">Perpendicular architecture in England.</note>
  There were perhaps fewer great buildings raised in
England at this time, but numbers of country and town houses, college buildings, chapels, town churches, and additions to older cathedrals, castles, and palaces remain to show the taste of the century. The style of these is called perpendicular, from the great use made of right angles and upright lines in its buildings. It is known by its flat arches, square-headed


<pb id="p.362" n="362"/>
 windows and doors, square-panelled walling, lofty pinnacles, low-pitched roofs, large broad window-lights, and elaborate ceilings delicately wrought with heavy carved pendants and thickly ribbed vaulting. The use of red and black brick for flat walling was increasing in the latter part of the century.
The college at Eton of <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName>'s foundation, the chapel of <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName> at Westminster, the tower of Magdalen College, <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> (early in the 16th century), built by Wolsey, and the same churchman's later palace buildings at Hampton Court, and college hall and choir roof at Christ Church, the Divinity School at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, and the tower of Gloucester
Cathedral, are fine examples of this style, which was more widely spread and used in England than in any continental country.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="5">Dress of the fifteenth century in England.</note>
  Change in architecture is nearly always a proof of a general change in taste, and so it was now, as folks' dress showed. The mantle and hood of the fourteenth century were disused, save by judges, mayors, bishops, and such great dignitaries. The dress of the men of the middle and upper classes was a long cloth gown with large sleeves, often fur-lined in winter at edge and wrist, girt with a narrow leather belt, from which hung the wearer's straight, broad-bladed, double-edged, ivory-hilted knife, his gypser [pouch], silver-mounted and silk-knotted, and his set or pair of large beads with a signet-ring at their tassel.
Late in the century <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> delighted in huge open sleeves, turned back on the shoulder, to show the rich lining of velvet or sable. Below this the short close-buttoned tunic, now called a doublet, and long cloth hose were worn as before. The hood in <persName key="Henry IV.">Henry IV.</persName>'s day was often worn as a cap, the face-hole fitting the crown of the head, while the neck-tippet hung down as a scarf, and the pipe of the hood wound round the flattened head part kept it in shape.  Later it was twisted into a scarf, and buttoned to the shoulder of the gown. Men's head-gear was a tight skull-cap of velvet or cloth, and over this, in public or out-of-doors, a <soCalled>"broad bonnet,"</soCalled> with jewel clasp and plume. This bonnet was simply the older tall cone-shaped beaver hat with its edges turned up all round and kept in place by a buckle of bronze or silver, and its top flattened into a broad crown. Sometimes only the back was turned up; the front edge then formed a peak, and shaded the eyes.  Beneath the gown a short tight tunic was worn, and long, tight cloth hose; the shoes were often peaked into long curling toe-pieces. High Spanish boots

<pb id="p.363" n="363"/> of soft leather were worn by travellers or huntsmen. The ladies also gave up the mantle and furred sur-coat, and took to a long-flowing, deep-sleeved gown, high and closely girt, with the collar thrown back over the shoulders, so that the tight necklace and embroidered linen collar could be seen. Married women wore their hair in large square-shaped nets or combs of silver wire, stiffly set on each side of the head, over which a lawn kerchief or cambric veil was fastened flat above and hanging to the shoulders behind.
Sometimes these side-nets were roll-shaped, and rose high on each side above the crown like horns. But later in the century the fashion changed, and the hair was worn in a mass at the back of the head under a stiff square or arched cap of velvet or fur, with embroidered lappets that hung down at the sides of the face and covered all the back of the head. The gown was now cut tight to the arms and waist, and a broad belt with silver studs clasped about the hips, at the hanging end of which swung the looking-glass or scent-box set with silver. Long Italian feather-fans, copied from Eastern models, came into use at the end of the century. Jewels were largely used-set in buttons, clasps, sewed into embroidered work on head-gear or gown, strung upon the necklace or let into rings. Large sums were spent in dress, and both <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> and <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName> took much thought and laid out much money upon their own and their wives' apparel. The old cuts and fashion of
<persName key="Edward III.">Edward III.</persName>'s days were still seen in the dark dresses of nuns and widows. The priest's robes had hardly changed since the thirteenth century.</p>
  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="6">Armour in the fifteenth century.</note>
  Armour was at its most complicated form in this century. Fresh pieces of plate strengthened the weak places which had formerly been guarded by mail, tuiles or skirt-pieces lapped over the thigh, pauldrons or shoulder-plates covered the shoulder and armpit, strong, flexible splints, jointed like the crawfish's tail, sheltered the throat, just above the breastplate, joined the elbow and knee-pieces to the arm and leg-plates, and formed the gauntlets and sollerets [metal shoes].
The left elbow-piece was broadened till it almost took the place of a shield; the breastplate was doubled in strength by a broad belt-piece covering the waist above and below.
Everywhere the plates were cunningly curved and shaped so as to turn a blow and let a thrust glide off, while they allowed their wearer to move as freely as possible under their weight of steel. But the increasing employment of

<pb id="p.364" n="364"/> gunpowder in war (especially abroad, where light, well-bored hand-guns were coming into use) was ere long to make all this skilful and thoughtful work vain; for it was seen that complete armour that would turn a bullet must be too cumbrous for real use.  In England the longbows, which would shoot far faster and nearly as hard as these hand-guns, still held their own for almost a century. The
18-foot Swiss pike had become a favourite weapon, for with it steady foot-soldiers could withstand the heaviest cavalry, though not a match for skilled Spanish swordsmen. The advantage of drill, and the regular training of soldiers in the use of their arms, was beginning to be acknowledged abroad, though it was not generally accepted in England till the next century. War was growing more costly than it had ever been before.</p>
  <p>7. <note place="foot" n="7">English writers of the fifteenth century.</note>
  During this century few English writers of note appear. Even the history of the time must be pieced together out of private letters, deeds, and account-books, rather than sought in State papers or minster histories. The long series of St. Alban's chroniclers ends with those of John of
<hi rend="italics">Amundsham</hi> (<dateRange from="1421" to="1440">1421-40</dateRange>) and an unnamed monk, and the register of the abbot, John of <hi rend="italics">Whethamstede</hi> (<dateRange from="1452" to="1461">1452-61</dateRange>).
<hi rend="italics">Thomas Otterbourne</hi>, a minorite, and <hi rend="italics">John Capgrave</hi>, an
Austin friar of Lynn, both wrote chronicles for the Lancaster kings; and <hi rend="italics">Thomas Elmham</hi>, prior of Lenton, penned prose and verse lives of <persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName> But the fashion now ran rather for princes and nobles to keep private historiographers, usually their heralds or chaplains, sometimes foreigners of learning. These men often wrote memoirs (we have one such of the Earl of Warwick); <persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName> and <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>'s chaplains wrote of parts of their masters' career; and <hi rend="italics">Bernard Andre</hi>, of Thoulouse, the poet-laureate, was <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName>'s chronicler, as <hi rend="italics">Polydore
Vergil</hi>, the Italian scholar, was <persName key="Henry VIII.">Henry VIII.</persName>'s. <hi rend="italics">Titus Livius,</hi> another Italian, was the historian of the <soCalled>"Good Duke
Humphrey,"</soCalled> for whom he wrote his brother's life. <hi rend="italics">William of Worcester</hi> (Sir John Fastolf's clerk and executor) wrote annals <dateRange from="1324" to="1491">1324-1491</dateRange>. <hi rend="italics">John Page</hi> wrote, in rough vein, of the
Sieges of Harfleur and Paris, which, as an attendant of
<persName key="Henry V.">Henry V.</persName>, he had witnessed. John Harding, a servant of the Percies, is the author of a full and well-composed history in verse. Private persons now began here and there to keep diaries noting the main public events they saw or heard of. There are also collections of correspondence come down to us, such as those of <hi rend="italics">Bekinton</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Pastons</hi>,

<pb id="p.365" n="365"/>
 the latter a mass of letters to and from John Paston or
Caistor (co-executor with William of Worcester to Sir John
Fastolf), and his family to the third generation, giving us much minute knowledge of the life and history of the times they cover.  For the story of the loss of France, the chronicles of <hi rend="italics">Jean de Waurin, Robert Blondel, Enguerrand de Monstrelet,</hi> and the French chronicles of the <hi rend="italics">Maid of
Orleans</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Realms of France and Normandy</hi>, give great help. The works of <hi rend="italics">Sir John Fortescue</hi> (c. <date value ="1400">1400</date>- c. <date value ="1485">1485</date>), the chief justice, especially the Praises of the Laws of England, and The Governance of England, give the opinions of an accomplished lawyer upon the English constitution of his own day.</p>
  <p>The poetry of the time was poor, written in imitation of
<persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>, or of the French <hi rend="italics">rhetoriqueurs</hi> (a school of poets with a forced and unnatural style), or even of the jog-trot makers of Rimes or Verse-Romances which <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName> had laughed at in his Sir Thopaz. <hi rend="italics">John of Lydgate</hi>, the monk of Bury (<dateRange from="1373" to="1460">1373-1460</dateRange>), whose long-winded Saints' Lives and
Story of Thebes exist, and <hi rend="italics">Thomas Hoccleve</hi> (<dateRange from="1370" to="1454">1370-1454</dateRange>), a more vigorous writer, who might in another age have done better work, were reckoned the best English verse-makers.
Dr. <persName key="Oswald">Oswald</persName> Bokenam, an Austin friar of Stoke-Clare, in
Suffolk, set several saints' lives into verse in <date value ="1443">1443</date>. There were others in the north and south of England who wrote similar works in regular but wooden verse; but the best collection of Saints' Lives was in prose by <hi rend="italics">John Mirk,</hi>
Austin canon of Lulshill, called the Festial, a book widely read and copied. There were also several sets of Mysteries or Miracle-Plays made in verse in this century, during which these popular Scripture plays were very popular.
One set was penned, c. <date value ="1470">1470</date>, by a canon of Chester. There were also no small number of ballads made, but we do not know the name of any that composed them, though they comprise far the best poetry of the century in England.</p>
  <p><persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>'s noblest followers wrote at the Scottish court.
<hi rend="italics">James the First</hi>, who had learned to love the English poet while a prisoner in England, wrote the <hi rend="italics">Kingis Quhair</hi>, c. <date value ="1420">1420</date>, a pretty love-poem, in his master's style.

Up to this time all books had been penned on parchment or paper, and there was a large class of <hi rend="italics">Scriveners,</hi> whose business it was to copy books or writings for their employers,-thus <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>'s scribe was named Adam, and the names of many others are met at the end of the books they copied. They wrote clear and regular hands; and at this time their skill was great, and they could turn out books well and quickly. But their art was to be almost entirely set aside by a new invention.</p>
  <p>Ever since <date value ="1300">1300</date>, regular block-printing had been known in
Europe; it had reached England as early as <date value ="1350">1350</date>.
<note place="foot" n="8">Printing brought to England by <persName key="Caxton, William">William Caxton</persName>.</note>
Upon flat-faced wooden blocks a drawing was made or a sentence written in black, all the white surface was then cut away so as to leave the pattern in relief; this was smeared with an oily ink, and then pressed upon pieces of paper or parchment, upon which it <hi rend="italics">printed</hi> the design.  In this way cards and placards and little books were made, as had been done long before in Japan and China (whence the art probably spread into the west) ; and it is in this way that <hi rend="italics">woodcuts</hi> are now cut and printed.    But these
<hi rend="italics">block-books</hi> are not printed books in the sense we now use those words, for there were as yet no types (that is, separate bits of metal, each cut into the pattern of a single letter), which could be set up together into any set of words, and then, when they were printed off in any number of copies, set up again in a fresh set of words, and so on. This discovery, which made printing cheap and easy, was made by a citizen of Mainz, one
<persName key="Guztenberg, John">John Guztenberg</persName> (<dateRange from="1400" to="1468">1400-68</dateRange>), who invented a means of casting correct and clear metal types about <date value ="1450">1450</date>. He entered into a partnership with a fellow-citizen, John Fust, a money-lender, and before <date value ="1455">1455</date> was able to put forth the first and also the most beautiful book that was ever printed-the
<hi rend="italics">Gutenberg Bible</hi>.  Though <persName key="Guztenberg, John">Gutenberg</persName> gained little by his skill, for he was cheated by his partner, his wonderful invention soon spread, and before <date value ="1500">1500</date> there were printing-offices hard at work in all the great towns of Western
Europe. The first English printer was <persName key="Caxton, William">William Caxton</persName>
(<dateRange from="1422" to="1492">1422-92</dateRange>); he had been apprenticed to the Lord Mayor of London, and when he became a master he settled in
Bruges as a merchant, and grew into such good repute that he was made Governor of the Company of Merchant

<date value ="1474">1474</date>, the <hi rend="italics">Game and Play of the Chess</hi>. Soon after this he moved to England, and, under the favour of the king and the Abbot of Westminster, set up his press in Westminster
Sanctuary, whence he issued such books as he thought best and most useful, both in English and Latin. Among them were <hi rend="italics"><persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName>'s Works; the Polychronicon</hi> (to which he made additions, thus bringing the history of England down to his own day); the <hi rend="italics">Recuyell</hi> [compilation] of <hi rend="italics">the History of
Troy</hi> (which he had first undertaken to translate for the
Duchess of Burgundy); the <hi rend="italics">Morte d'Arthur </hi>(founded on the
French prose, romances, and North English poems of the
Arthur cycle, and put into English prose by Sir Thomas
Malory, a priest); <hi rend="italics">The Dictes and Sayinges of the Philosophers</hi>
(Englished by Anthony Lord Rivers, brother-in-law of <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName>); the story of Reynard the Fox (turned from the
Flemish by <persName key="Caxton, William">Caxton</persName>); and <hi rend="italics">the Golden Legend</hi>, an edition of
Mirk's Festial, founded upon a body of Saints' Lives made by James of Viraggio (<dateRange from="1230" to="1298">1230-98</dateRange>), and Englished in <date value ="1438">1438</date>, a book often reprinted by <persName key="Caxton, William">Caxton</persName> and his successors. <persName key="Caxton, William">Caxton</persName>, who was himself a good scholar, knowing Latin and French as well as the Dutch tongue, tells us in the prefaces of his books something of his patrons (chief and most learned of whom he reckons Tiptoft, the Earl of Worcester), and of the difficulties he had in choosing books to be Englished for their behoof, and in translating them in such style as should content them. But his example was soon followed by other printers, such as T. Rood of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName>, his rival, and the busy Wynkyn de Worde of Westminster, his successor.
By the end of <persName key="Henry VII.">Henry VII.</persName>'s reign printing was firmly established in England. And that the <quote>"new art"</quote> was soon reckoned a power in the world is proved by the check held over the press by the Council and the Church, obliging the printer to get a licence for every book he wished to issue, and keeping strict watch to prevent the entry of foreign printed books without examination into the country.</p>
  <p>9. <note place="foot" n="9"> The English language changes in the fifteenth century.</note>
The early printers, as <persName key="Caxton, William">Caxton</persName> tells us, after a little wavering, determined to make the <hi rend="italics">midland</hi> dialect, the book English, the standard of speech, leaving the northern dialect to the poets and printers of Scotland, who used it for many a long year yet, and altogether passing over the southern

<pb id="p.368" n="368"/>
 dialect, which was never again to be used by men of letters.
In the latter part of the fifteenth century English was undergoing a deep and broad change; it was dropping the inflections which made <hi rend="italics">Middle-English</hi> such a tongue as
German is now, and passing into the uninflected modern
English tongue we now speak and write. But this striking change is disguised for us by the early printers who copied the hand-written books of the end of the fourteenth century and beginning of the fifteenth century, and used their spelling and inflections as a pattern. And this is how we get the final <hi rend="italics">mute or soundless <quote>" e,"</quote></hi> and many other difficulties of our present spelling. There were other changes to come which would mark off the English of the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries from that of the nineteenth century, but they were changes of <hi rend="italics">pronunciation and structure,</hi> not of <hi rend="italics">substance,</hi> like this change of the fifteenth century, which forms the true boundary between Middle and Modern English. It is to be noted that French ceased to be a spoken tongue in
England in this century.</p>

  During the early years of this century population increased till in <date value ="1500">1500</date> it was about 4,200,000. For there being plenty to eat, no plague, and light taxes, while prices and wages were steady (save for the slight fall for a few years following the debasement of the coinage), the progress of the country and its happiness were not hurt by the wars abroad nor the struggle that followed them at home. And as
Commines the French historian noted, these Wars of the
Roses caused no hurt save to those who were in the battles, for neither side could afford to risk its popularity by acts of plundering or oppression.</p>

  <p><note place="foot" n="11">A Retrospect</note>WE have now reached a line of real division in English history, the line at which the Middle Ages, with their forms of life and thought, and their systems of church and state, land and labour, close; and the age of the New Learning and the New Faith, which are known as the Renascence and the Reformation, is coming in to reshape and recast the life and thoughts of men. So deep is this dividing-line, that it is certain there was more in common between <persName key="AElfred">&#x00C6;lfred</persName> and <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName>, or <persName key="Dunstan,Saint">Dunstan</persName> and
William of Wykeham, though severed by centuries, than between <persName key="Edward IV.">Edward IV.</persName> and <persName key="Henry VIII.">Henry VIII.</persName>, or Warwick and
Wolsey, who are only a generation apart.</p>
  <p>At such a place it is well to pause for a moment, and try to sum up in a few lines the story of England as far as it has been traced in these pages.</p>
  <p>It begins with the English immigration-a set of small



<pb id="p.370" n="370"/>
 tribes (each strongly knit within itself by personal ties, but only held to its neighbours by the use of a common tongue) coming into a land and dealing (mostly in bitter warfare, it is true) with a people full of the traces of a higher civilisation than they, the new-comers, had hitherto known. After nearly three centuries of buccaneering and border warfare, the English tribes, having won enough land for their needs, are first stirred to new thoughts by the zeal of a few single-hearted Scottish saints, such as Aidan, Finan, and Fursay, and then happily drawn by the wise foresight of Gregory,
<persName key="Wilfrith">Wilfrith</persName>, and Theodore into the fold of the mighty Western
Church, <quote>" the nobler heir of Rome,"</quote> to share in all its light and learning, and to feel and show forth in turn the benefits of that spirit of order and union and sympathy which were among its noblest gifts to the Teutonic peoples. The tribal governments, leaving behind them a living legacy of a habit of local self-government, now break up under the violent pressure of three successful foreign invasions, which weld the local <soCalled>" folks "</soCalled> of the English together with the incoming armies of Northmen, Danes, and Normans into one English people, with vigorous dynasties of kings and ministers at their head in church and state, and a central government strong enough to serve as the foundation of a constitution which was to keep England free and united through the changes and shocks of more than three hundred years.</p>
  <p>With <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> English history takes a fresh start. England appears as part of a great empire loosely linked together by the family ties of the ruling house, and only held by deep statecraft, and the power of the spear and the bow, to swell the gains of the trader and the pride of the English people. But this close and constant bond between
England and the Continent enabled the English to share more fully than they could otherwise have done in all the deep movements which make the most glorious period of the Middle Ages memorable. Englishmen fill high places in the roll of medieval saints, churchmen, and philosophers, and Englishmen also take high rank among the chroniclers, poets, builders, artisans, and merchants ofthethirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. The court of London and
Bordeaux was only less brilliant than those of Paris and Italy, and the University of <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> is the fairest daughter of the
Schools of Paris round which the highest thoughts of the
West centred for three hundred years. Again, it is to the reign of <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> that we must look to witness the first putting into force of those imperial claims of the English


  <pb id="p.371" n="371"/>
 kings which were not satisfied to the full till long after the days we are now dealing with, although for a few months
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName> was the sole monarch of Great Britain and
Ireland. However, the conquests of Ireland and Wales were as yet, it must be acknowledged, of greater import to the Irish and Welsh themselves than to England or
Englishmen, and their whole results were not felt till a later time. But it must be kept clearly in mind that it is to
<persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName>, and his ministers Lucy and Glanville, that we owe the wise direction of the royal power through regular officers, and the fit ordering of a system of law which should carry with it the weight of the king's name, while keeping all that was worthy to be kept in the old system of local courts.</p>
  <p>The constitution as left by <persName key="Henry II.">Henry II.</persName> was further secured by that double bulwark of the charters which was raised by
Robert Fitz Walter and Stephen of Langton, and made safe and sure for ages to come by the steadfast unselfishness of <persName key="de Montfort, Simon">Simon de Montfort</persName> and the reasonable wisdom of his conqueror and pupil, <persName key="Edward I.">Edward I.</persName> For it was <persName key="de Montfort, Simon">Simon</persName> and
<persName key="Edward I.">Edward</persName> who, by due use of the fruitful principle of <hi rend="italics">representation</hi>, turned the <hi rend="italics">Great Council</hi> of the Elders into the
<hi rend="italics">Parliament</hi> of the Commonwealth, creating a body which should, as far as was practicable, reflect the feelings of the whole nation upon all matters of general concern. Very soon, in spite of the fierce passions of the ruling classes
(which left such dark stains over the reign of Edward's own son), debate and arguments and votes replace the show of swords that carried the day at <placeName key="Runnymead">Runnymead</placeName>, and the brutal violence which crushed William of the Beard. Liberties are bargained for at Westminster, till the savings of the poor buy from the king even the right to control and replace the officers of his own choice, and to refuse him the money he believed he needed to carry out his plans. It was in the reign of Edward's grandson that the Good Parliament reached the highest mark of constitutional progress attained in the
Middle Ages. For though <persName key="Richard II.">Richard II.</persName>'s attempt to put an end to the cruel jealousies of the royal house by getting a partisan parliament to grant him despotic power was ruinous to himself; yet, on the other hand, the constitutional pretences of the poverty-stricken Lancastrian kings could neither carry out any feasible reform nor check the dissensions of the nobles, nor prevent the government of the country from slipping, after the death of <persName key="Henry VI.">Henry VI.</persName>, into the hands of a close and little controlled Royal Council,




<pb id="p.372" n="372"/>
 composed of the king's friends. And, in fact, it was to this
Council, rather than to Parliament, that at the close of the fifteenth century the nation looked for the enforcement of justice and the reform of church and state.</p>
  <p>The causes of this palsy of Parliament, which was to make safe constitutional progress impossible for two hundred years, and to leave to the Long Parliament the task of taking up the work the Good Parliament had left half-done, are not far to seek. The whole power of the governing classes was wasted in glorious but futile foreign conquests, alternating with cruel and treacherous civil wars, till the nobles of England perished in their folly, and the headsman's axe cut off the remnant that the sword had spared.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, the governed classes, the artisan, the merchant, the yeoman, the tenant-farmer, the serf, were left alone to work out their own fortunes. The awful Black
Death, which had seemed so relentless and cruel in its attacks, turned out in the end to have been one of the chief means of changing the old order of land owning and tilling for an easier system, and of making men in their own interests do tardy but needful justice to their fellows. The men who died for the bettering of the commons of England after Hurlingtide did not altogether perish in vain. The fifteenth century was happier for the poor man than the fourteenth, though the happy balance of causes which allowed of this prosperity was necessarily overthrown in the changes which came about at the outset of the Renascence and Reformation.</p>
  <p>The whole story witnesses to slow but steady upward progress. We have been trying to trace the birth and infancy of a great people.  We have been, as the poet says-
               <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"noting the efforts of heroes--</l>
<l>  Is the deferment long ? bitter the slander, poverty, death ?</l>
<l>  Lies the seed unrecked for centuries in the ground ? lo, to God's
     due occasion</l>
<l>  Uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms,</l>
<l>  And fills the earth with use and beauty."</l></quote></p>

<p>The conclusion, too, must be that of the poet:-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Roaming in thought over the universe. I saw the little that is good
     steadily hastening toward immortality,</l>
<l>  And the vast all that is called Evil I saw hastening to merge itself
     and become lost and dead."</l></quote></p>
