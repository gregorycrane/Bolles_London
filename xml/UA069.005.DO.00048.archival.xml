<p>        SEVERAL of these essays have, in substance at least, been printed before.
    I have to thank the Editor of the
           Guardian for kindly allowing me to use
those contributed to his journal. The second essay
and that on St. Helen's appeared in the late
People's Magazine, and the St. Olave's in Long Ago,
-another magazine which must be numbered
with things of the past: I have to thank Mr. John
Piggott, F.S.A., for leave to use it. And I have
also to thank the proprietors of Cassell's Magazine
for leave to use an article on <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, which, in
part at least, is incorporated with "London a
Century Ago." The bulk of this essay, however,
formed a lecture delivered five years ago for the
benefit of a South London church building fund,
and has not been printed before. The articles on
London Geography, Northumberland House, and
Berkhamsted are new, and that on "Dr. <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName>
and the Savoy," although a considerable part of it
was used in a recent sermon at the Chapel Royal,
is also now in print for the first time.

<p>     LONDON has become more than a city:
     it is a country, a kingdom in itself.
       With a population already greater than
          that of Holland or Portugal, almost as
great as that of Sweden and Norway together, it
increases every day. It spreads north, south, east
and west, creeping onward like the tide of the sea,
slowly but surely, year by year, and obliterates, as
it goes, all the original features of the country.
The green fields and orchards are first swallowed
up. Next, the old houses and all historical associations. Lastly, the face of the ground is so covered
over with brick and mortar, that the geographical
landmarks-hill and dale, brook and marsh-are
wiped out, and can never reappear. Who can show
us the fen in Finsbury, or the islet at Hay Hill ?
Not only are they gone, but they will never come
back. Supposing even that London became a desolate






<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>
plain, these natural features would not be
restored.  The thought gives something of a
melancholy interest to the subjects of which I have
endeavoured to treat in this volume; and there is
melancholy enough without it. To the clergyman
there is, in the every-day aspect of London, a
sadness which, when he goes into the streets and
lanes where his work lies, is redoubled in intensity.
To influence London is to influence the world; but
to grapple successfully with the terrible problems
everywhere presented by London life, is at best
a hopeless task. The faithful minister may do
something, but it is not much; and moments of
hopelessness and discouragement come upon him,
the harder he works and the more he accomplishes.</p>
<p>  Hard work is much alleviated by the possession
and cultivation of a taste. We have scarcely yet
sufficiently calculated on the power of the lighter
arts and sciences in the education of the young.
But the man whose life is passed in labour, whether
manual or intellectual, has within him the possibility of great happiness, and the certainty of
relaxation without vice, if he early take up, as the
amusement of his leisure, art, archaeology, zoology,
or some other scientific or asthetic pursuit.
</p>  <p>London is full of interest; and the country
within half a day's journey of London is the most






      <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>

interesting part of England. The man who knows
something of the history of Kent, Surrey, and
Hertfordshire, knows something tangible of the
history of his country. He can connect events
with places; and the places are often beautiful,
while the events are often the greatest in our history.
And the working men of London-be they clerks
priestly or lay, be they merchants or mechanics-
can find, within the limits of a Saturday afternoon's
excursion, scenes and places which a tour on the
Continent will not exceed, for the Englishman,
either in interest or beauty.</p>
  <p>I have endeavoured, in these pages, to describe a
few of the places which may be thus visited. Some
of them are in town, some in the country, but all
are within easy reach. And many places remain
of which, though they are within the limit of an
afternoon, I have said nothing. Such are <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName>
and the Tower, Westminster and St. Paul's, and
many others within the town; while, a short way
out, Windsor and Eltham, King's Langley and
Chertsey, Hatfield, and a hundred more would have
been accessible. But I am not writing a guide-book,
and have selected my subjects rather on the principle that no place near London is so uninteresting
that something may not be found in its history, or
its situation, or its buildings, worth thinking over.
Among the localities less often visited, I might have


<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>

mentioned Dunstable, with its priory; or Burnham, with its abbey and its beeches; or Cobham,
with its hospital and its brasses; or Stoke d'Abernon,
where a visitor will find scenery and antiquity
combined in such equal proportions, that probably
no other spot within a short distance from London
will better repay him. Richmond and Hampton
Court, too, are full of historical associations.
Greenwich and Tilbury to the east, Brentford and
Harmondsworth to the west, Harrow and Pinner to
the north, all afford material for pleasant half-days'
excursions, and might have been included in my
book.</p>
  <p>And without wandering so far afield, the London
archaeologist has numberless objects, besides those
I have described, worthy of notice close at hand.
The topography of Clerkenwell, with the monastery
of the Knights of St. John, still offers points but
half explored. The gate is only one, and that the
latest in date, of the buildings which remain. The
crypt is not so easily seen, but it will reward a
visitor. Then St. Bartholomew's Priory, with its
noble church and cloisters, which may still be
traced; or Austin Friars, one of the few relics of
the Pointed style spared by the fire; or Bermondsey
Abbey, of which something, if very little, remains;
or St. Giles's, Cripplegate, with its neighbour, Syon
College; or St. Saviour's, Southwark; all may be






                                <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>

easily visited and are worth visiting. I might suggest
to anyone ambitious to do good work, a collection
of the quaint epitaphs of the seventeenth and
previous centuries which may yet be found in
London churches; or, what would be better still, a
careful study of the churches older than the fire, of
which so few are left to us. Such a pilgrimage
might begin within the Tower, at St. Peter ad
Vincula, and might include All Hallows, Barking;
its neighbour, St. Olave's, Hart Street, of which I
have said something; St. Andrew, Undershaft;
St. Etheldreda's and St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, of
which I have endeavoured to give a short account;
the two or three old churches mentioned above ;
and further west, the Temple; the Savoy, from
whose curious history I have taken one chapter;
and above all, Westminster. These ancient Gothic
buildings of London would form the subject of an
interesting volume.</p>
  <p>If any of my readers take up such a task, let me
beg of them to remember, in their investigation,
the great importance of exactness in minute details;
and of constant reference to, and acknowledgment
of, authorities. Half the collections of epitaphs, for
example, are of no historical or antiquarian value
whatever, because chapter and verse, place and
date, are not given. The young archaeologist should
accustom himself never, if he can help it, to take


<pb id="p.20" n="20"/>

anything at second-hand; but at the same time,
never to neglect any means of adding to his
information, however humble it may at first
appear.</p>
  <p>In the following chapters I have endeavoured to
give, first, a picture of the natural features of the
district on which London has been built; next,
one of London as it was in the early years of the
fifteenth century-say in the reign of Henry V.;
then a brief sketch of what it was only a hundred
years ago. These chapters may be taken together
in support of a proposition I think it well worth
while to uphold, namely, that our progress has been
greater in the last hundred years than in many ages
before them. Our progress has not always been
made in times of perfect peace; but war has
invariably tended to national declension in art, in
science, in social improvement, and above all in
true religion.</p>
  <p>The chapters on Old London generally are
followed by three sketches of ancient churches, and
one of an old river-side palace,-St. Olave's, Hart
Street; St. Helen's, Bishopsgate; the Chapel
Royal,  Savoy;   and  Northumberland   House,
<placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>.   In the cases of the first and
third of these, I have connected with them the
name of a prominent character of the seventeenth
century.</p>







         <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>

  <p>I next take two ancient suburban.residences, one
ecclesiastical and the other civil; and lastly I trace
some more extended wanderings, one in Kent, one
in Essex, one in Herts, and one in Surrey; ending
with a notice of St. Albans Abbey, which recent
events have brought into such prominence.

<p>THE natural features of the eastern parts
           of Middlesex are covered by an impenetrable veil. Rivers and ravines
           are masked, hills are levelled, marshes
are hidden. A flood of brick fills up the hollows.
The brooks run far underground. The flats are
elevated, and the heights depressed. The tide of
buildings surges on, swallowing up in its course
fields and gardens, parks and woods; uprooting
trees, blasting flowers; shutting out even the air
and the winds of heaven. There is something
appalling in the resistless growth of London.
Middlesex is nearly eaten up. Surrey and Kent and
Essex have been largely contaminated. It spreads
like moths fretting a garment. The old form of
the country, as it lay bare to the sky, is wholly lost.
It is overwhelmed and obliterated. Even when the
houses fall and London becomes ruinous heaps, the
old geography will not be restored. The rivers will
never flow again. The valleys and the hills will
alike have disappeared, and men shall some day
talk of the plains of London as we talk of the
plains of Babylon. If we could look on the land


<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>

we live in as it was before our city was made, we
should not know it. We may still identify the
seven hills of Rome, but who will find for us the
seven streams which traverse London ? We can
neither find the Langbourne on the east nor the
Kilbourne on the west. Who can define the extent
and the boundaries of the fields of St. Martin and
St. Giles, or tell us where the mount stood in Mount
Street, or the conduit in Conduit Street ? We have
all a vague idea that there is a stream running
under Buckingham Palace, to account for the fog
which never rises from off those dreary gardens.
We are in the habit of taking strangers to Panyer
Alley, as to the <soCalled>highest ground in the City,</soCalled> and
we do not yet forget the steep ascent of Holborn
Hill. But our information seldom extends much
further. We are unacquainted with the soil in our
own street. We have no notion how many feet it
is above or below the level of the Thames. We
have never remarked whether Park Lane slopes to
the north or to the south. We have not the slightest
idea over what river Battle Bridge was built, nor
why we should have to go down steps from Threadneedle Street to Broad Street. All these things
depend more or less directly on the physical geography of the region which we have covered over
and disguised with pavements and rows of houses.</p>
  <p>The London district, at least the more thickly
inhabited portion of it, consists of a series of low
hills rising from the sloping bank of the Thames.






<pb id="p.25" n="25"/>

These hills are divided from one another by brooks
or bournes of varying importance, which flow into,
the river between Milbank and the Tower. The
line of hills is not uniformly parallel with the river's
edge, as it stands east and west, while the Thames,
which flows from west to east when it passes London,
flows from south to north when it passes Westminster. There is thus a long tract of level ground-
south of Notting Hill and west of the river Thames,
where the elevation is very slight, and where in
places there is even a depression. On this tract an
enormous population is now gathered. The villages
of Kensington and Brompton were formerly separated
from the water's edge by an unwholesome morass,
but even this has been built upon, and Pimlico,
which contains some of the worst, contains also
some of the best, streets in London. We are surprised to notice the great differences of level and
also of soil which occur. While north of the Park,
in places, the ground rises to nearly a hundred feet
above the sea, at Milbank it only stands twelve feet
above the river. The highest ground in the City is
in Cannon Street, where it reaches sixty feet, and
not in Newgate Street, where it is only fifty-eight;
for the old rhyme in Panyer Alley is untrue, like so
many other things we have believed in from our
youth up. The slope falls rapidly towards the east.
Stepney is only thirty-five feet above the river, and
a short distance beyond we are again at the level of
Brompton. But if we look further into the matter


<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>

we find that the slope from the Thames and its
adjacent morass is not uniform, that it is broken
into a number of different eminences, and that each
ridge is separated from the next by a running
stream. If we could divest Oxford Street, for
instance, of its houses, we might see that the whole
line of thoroughfare from Newgate to Notting Hill
goes up and down hill alternately not less than
three times. Instead of a long piece of almost
level road, bordered on either side by houses, we
should see a steep hill when we had crossed the
Fleet, round which the river would run on the north
and east, and arriving at the summit should find
ourselves on a ridge elevated perhaps as much as
eighty feet above the Thames, towards which, on
the left, there would be a continuous slope, while on
the right a valley of slight depth, but considerable
steepness, would mark the north-westward winding
of the Fleet. This valley, of which the head would
be at Euston Square, would correspond with a
similar depression on the west of a large tract of
the most dense clay known to geologists. This
tract is now the Regent's Park, and from it the
principal streams of which we speak take their
source. The Fleet and the Old Bourne on the east,
the Marybourne on the south, the Tybourne on the
west, all either flow directly from it, or are largely
fed by the waters gathered in its tenacious grasp.
We wonder to find the Zoological Gardens damp
even on a fine day, and cold on a warm day, but a

  <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>

more unfortunate situation in which to place an
acclimatising establishment could hardly have been
found elsewhere in Middlesex. What suits flowers
and trees does not suit Bengal tigers and <soCalled>exotic</soCalled>
birds.</p>
  <p>The ridge which begins at <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName> reaches its
highest point near the Regent's Circus. Thence
to Bird Street we find a slope which, if we could
strip off the granite and bricks, would be seen to
be part of a long ravine extending from the
Church of St. Mary <soCalled>lebone,</soCalled> southward to Westminster, the little brook which marks its course
being still acknowledged in the right name of the
parish, and in that of Brook Street and of Engine
Street, <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, where probably a waterwheel
or <soCalled>engine</soCalled> was turned by the stream. It is not
very easy to trace the depression caused by the
bourne. The windings of Marylebone Lane perhaps represent the earlier windings of the stream
along whose banks it ran. At Stratford Place, a
few centuries ago, there was a conduit connected
with the stream, and standing on its left bank, and
this is still the boundary between the territories of
the Corporation and the Duke of Westminster.
The brook turns to the left on crossing Oxford
Street; then, winding round the base of a mount,
and feeding another conduit, it turns almost at
right angles past Hay Hill, and thence under Lansdowne House by Engine Street into the Green
Park, across which its path is marked, especially at


<pb id="p.28" n="28"/>

sunset, by a line of mist. Emerging very near, if
not actually under the spot on which Buckingham
Palace stands, it turns again to the right, and
finally falls into the Thames at Westminster, forming in the last few hundred yards the delta of
Thorney. In all probability this brook was the
original <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>: and the place of Mortimer's
execution in <date value="1330">1330</date> cannot have been far distant
from Stratford Place. So lonely was the neighbourhood, that St. Mary's Church having been
repeatedly robbed, Bishop Braybrook removed it
from the foot of Marylebone Lane to the High
Street early in the fifteenth century, though, with
characteristic immobility, the vestry remained,
where it still stands, close to the original site.
From this point again there is a considerable ascent,
the highest ridge being just opposite the Marble
Arch; and here the traditional <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, the bourne
in particular from which so many travellers never
returned, has usually been placed. The sandy and
gravelly soil must have been found unsuitable for
gardens. The hill was probably little more than a
bare heath, favourable, no doubt, except under
peculiar circumstances, to human life; for, standing
as it does almost a hundred feet above the Thames,
surrounded on all sides by valleys, more or less
depressed, and bounded on the east and west by
the Tybourne and the Marybourne, the hill, although
without a name of its own, has always been remarkable in later times for its low death-rate, a blessing

<pb id="p.29" n="29"/>

duly acknowledged by the inhabitants, who built St.
Luke's Church in Nutford Place to commemorate
the absence of cholera from the district during
the visitation of <date value="1849">1849</date>. Though the Tybourne or
<placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> has as many aliases as some of the heroes
who passed their last moments upon its banks, we
can trace its course more easily than that of the
companion stream. Rising originally in the clay
north of the Regent's Park, it takes a southwesterly course, and, having been augmented by
the Westbourne, it reaches the boundary of Hyde
Park, where the old burial-ground of St. George's,
Hanover Square, was placed to be well away from
the houses. Traversing the Park by a winding but
well-marked course, it is now lost in the Serpentine;
but time was, no doubt, when the junction of the
two bournes gave its name to the abbey manor of
Ey or Ait, now, by the Middlesex pronunciation,
corrupted into Hyde.</p>
  <p>If, instead of turning west at the Fleet below
Holborn Hill, we try to examine the geographical
features of the City itself, the difficulties in our
way are even greater. The hill of which St.
Paul's is the crown never rises much more than
half the height of that on which the gallows stood
at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>. And some <num value="15" type="sub">fifteen</num> or <num value="20" type="sub">twenty</num> feet of even
this moderate elevation must be accounted for by
the successive destructions of a series of cities
which have stood on the same site, and which have
contributed to the salubrity of their modern representative






<pb id="p.30" n="30"/>

by raising it on a deep layer of ashes
and adventitious soil of all kinds. We are not concerned here with the exact place occupied by Roman
London. Recent discoveries have added to the
proofs adduced by Mr. W. H. Black, in <date value="1863">1863</date>, to show
that it stood west of the Wallbrook. If the masonry
just uncovered at Newgate be in reality Roman, it
reached just as far north-west as he would have
had us believe. His view, notwithstanding certain
discoveries of Roman remains on Tower Hill, would
have finally disposed of a theory seldom now held as
to the origin of the Tower. Two streams crossed the
site of the City. Both have disappeared, like the Fleet
itself. The Langbourne only survives in the name
of the ward through which it ran, and Sherbourne
Lane marks its later course before it fell into the
Thames at Swan Wharf. The Wallbrook also had
at least two names, whether as the Dour it gave a
name to Dowgate, and whether as the Wallbrook it
really marked the eastern boundary of the ancient
city. Barges at one time sailed up it at high water
as far as Bucklersbury, and a boat-hook of Roman
make has been found in Coleman Street. Bridges
crossed it at the same period and later, one of them
connecting the two streets which are now the two
ends of Cannon Street. The ship which formed
the vane of St. Mildred's in the Poultry has been
referred to the stream  which flowed under the
church; St. Mary Bothaw has been explained as
St. Mary Boat-haw, and the course of the brook


<pb id="p.31" n="31"/>

may be traced across Princes Street, behind the
Bank, along Broad Street, until, like the Langbourne, it reaches Finsbury. The marshy ground
in Moorfields is to the City what the Regent's Park
clay is to the west end; and though Threadneedle
Street is thirteen and Broad Street six feet above
the ancient level of the land, they preserve in a remarkable manner evidences of their respective
positions when suburban villas lined the banks of
the Wallbrook, and corn grew upon Cornhill.</p>

<p>WHEN  we consider the   extraordinary
       growth of London, both in size and
  population, within the last few years,
         and that this growth is not the only
way in which it has altered within the memory






<pb id="p.33" n="33"/>

of many still living, we cannot be surprised that
the changes of all kinds in four hundred years
should be much greater. This consideration does
not, however, diminish the interest we feel in
tracing those changes. Londoners are not alone in
their feelings about their city. All England shares
in their pride. And now-a-days the great increase
of facilities for locomotion has rendered the features
of the Metropolis more or less familiar to almost
everyone, even in remote parts of the kingdom; and
most of those who have visited it will confess to
having experienced a feeling of something very like
awe when they saw for the first time those thoroughfares whose names were already household words
to them.</p>
  <p>To an Englishman, Westminster Hall and the
Abbey, St. Paul's and the Tower of London, are
crowded with associations; but not only in such remarkable places as these does he feel an interest, but
even in the very streets, alleys, and turnings which
conduct him to them. It is impossible to pass
Whitehall without thinking of Charles I. It is hard
to pass the Marble Arch without thinking of <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>.
The open space of Lincoln's Inn Fields constantly
reminds us of William Lord Russell and his execution there; we think we see the great square filled
with anxious faces, and the mourning coach which
conveyed the dying patriot turning out of Queen-
street; we fancy we hear him repeat, as he sees the
great assembly, the opening lines of the 149th Psalm







<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>

     <quote>0 praise ye the Lord, prepare your glad voice
        <lb/>His praise in the great assembly to sing;</quote>
and adding, <quote>I am about to praise Him in a greater
company than this.</quote> Nor as we pass along the
Strand and under Temple Bar, can we forget how
often Johnson and his friends walked along there
and under the same arch, and especially the walk
he and Goldsmith took to Westminster and back,
and how they looked up at the heads of the unfornate Scots rebels of <date value="1745">1745</date>, which still grinned from
their spikes on the top of the gate. Nor can we
repress a shudder as we glance from Ludgate-hill
along the Old Bailey; nor a sigh of pity when King-
street, Westminster, reminds us of Edmund Spenser,
who died there <quote>for lake of bread;</quote> or when
Brooke-street, <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, recalls the death in similar
circumstances of the boy Chatterton. Almost every
corner in London teems with such recollections, but
I will endeavour in the present paper to confine my
attention to a view of the size and state of the city
-say in the commencement of the reign of Henry V.</p>
   <p>One sentence will show how very different its
aspect was then from what we see now. The inhabited portion was almost confined to the City proper.
Although the population of that portion was large-
considerably larger than it is now-the area was
very small, the houses being for the most part
within the walls. The merchants lived in their
places of business, and every house and street was
crowded with citizens. They did not, as now, resort




 <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>

to the City only in the day-time for business, and
keep villas in the suburbs. Few except the monks
dared to live beyond the protection of the City walls.</p>
  <p>These walls commenced at the Tower, between
which and the wall there was a ditch; and we read
of Edward III. ordering the ditch to be cleared lest
it should overflow into that fortress. No wonder that
we find about the same time a bill for medicines
supplied to the unfortunate King of Scots, who had
been imprisoned there for eleven years. The bill
amounts to &#x00A3;2 12s. 9d.   This sum   represents
between &#x00A3;40 and &#x00A3;50 in our money. From the
Tower the wall passed northward as far as Aldgate,
which was really a gate in those days. A gate was
still standing on the spot a hundred years ago; in
fact, very few of the City gates had been demolished
when George III. came to the throne.</p>
  <p>Outside Aldgate there was a small village or
hamlet called Whitechapel, and near it a monastery
of the White Friars, or Friars Minors, which has
given its name to the Minories. A little farther to
the north there was another monastery and hospital
dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, and the open
country round was known as the Hospital or 'Spital
Fields. Shoreditch lay a little to the west, and was
the estate of an honourable family of the name of
Shore, many of whom were City merchants. One
of them, a jeweller, was husband to Jane Shore.</p>
<p>Then outside Moorgate was a moor or heath, and
in the hollow nearer the City wall a piece of marshy


<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>

ground which is often said to have given its name to
the district of Finsbury. The street now called
London-wall still shows the marks of the great foss
which ran under the wall; and parts of the fortifications themselves may still be seen a little to the
west of Moorgate, at Cripplegate churchyard. In
the same direction there was a small gate or barbican, which has given its name to a modern street;
and to the number of beggars who assembled here

<figure id="Fig.005" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.023.DO01.00005"><head>MOORGATE</head></figure>

we may attribute the name of the neighbouring
church, which stood outside the walls, and was

<pb id="p.37" n="37"/>

perhaps resorted to by mendicants because they were forbidden the exercise of their
trade in the
City.</p>
<p><figure id="Fig.006" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.023.DO01.00006"><head>Cripplegate</head></figure>Aldersgate
stood close to
where the
General Post-
office has been
built; and next
came Newgate,
which seems to
have been used
as a prison for
London and Middlesex as early as <date value="1218">1218</date>. Holborn
Bars were a kind of outwork to Newgate, and
there was some fortification near them, the site
of which is indicated by Castle-street.   Then
came Ludgate, and, as an outwork, Temple Bar,
within which was the river Fleet and the Fleet
Bridge where now is Farringdon-street; and the
wall ended close to where Blackfriars Bridge now
stands.</p>
  <p>There was some protection also along the river;
and we hear of Dowgate and Billingsgate among
other modes of access to the water; but except a



<pb id="p.38" n="38"/>

strongly fortified castle at each end of London Bridge,
there were few attempts at defence on that side.</p>
  <p>If we return to Ludgate and pass out through the
gate (which was said to have been called after a
mythical personage ever so many centuries before
Julius Caesar, but which more probably is called
from the river or flood), we find ourselves at the
small bridge which conducts us over the Flood, or
Fleet. Vessels are moored in this little river as high
as the bridge; on the right we have the pleasant
gardens and gentle slope of the Earl of Lincoln's
grounds; and beyond, at the top of the ascent,
we see his house. About the time of which I speak
it was no longer in the Earl's hands, and the lawyers' chambers were very soon to convert it into
Lincoln's Inn.</p>
  <p>More than a hundred years before, or in <date value="1307">1307</date>, we
find the Earl of that time complaining to Parliament-which sat then at Carlisle on account of the
King's expedition to Scotland-that vessels could
hardly reach the bridge on the Fleet, so much was
it impeded by rubbish thrown into it; and reciting
that hitherto they had been able to go up as far as
King's Cross, where there had been wharves for the
reception of merchandise.</p>
  <p>If we pursue our way along what is now Fleet-
street, we pass on the left, just before we reach
Temple Bar, the great monastery of the Knights
Templars, then called the New Temple, to distinguish it from their former habitation near <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>.


   <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>

In this place the King's jewels or <soCalled><foreign lang="LA">jocalia</foreign></soCalled> were
deposited for safety by most of the sovereigns until
the time of Henry III. King John had begun to use
the Tower for this purpose, and thither the regalia
were finally removed in <date value="1252">1252</date>.</p>
  <p>Passing through Temple Bar, we find ourselves
in open country. The road, now the Strand, is a
mere muddy track, overgrown with bushes, and
skirted on the right by gardens and thickets. On
the left, between the road and the river, are a few
half-fortified town houses of the great nobility,
Arundel House, which came first, being perhaps the
most important. Pleasure grounds and gardens are
round them and the Temple, and walks along the
Thames, like what we still see at Richmond and
Twickenham. At St. Clement's Church there are
a few houses, said to be the remains of a colony of
Danes who settled here before the Conquest; many
of them are pleasure houses and taverns, much
resorted to by the youth of the City, who come to
drink of the water of the neighbouring holy well,
and to play at various games in the open fields of
Lincoln's Inn. And probably here they are often
entertained with stories about the grim Danish king,
son of Canute, who lies buried in the neighbouring
church; how, when he had killed himself by his
gluttony at <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName>, his body was buried in Westminster Abbey, and was dug up again by his brother
and successor and thrown into the Thames; and
how one day a fisherman, drawing his net to shore,


<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>

was astonished at the unusual weight until the
royal body was discovered; and how it finally found
a resting-place under the fane of St. Clement.</p>
   <p>Going on still to the westward, we come to what
was called Aldwych-road, where now stand Wych-
street and Drury-lane; and leaving on our left the
garden of the Convent of Westminster, we pass on
the right the church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and
emerge in the Oxford-road, near the pleasantly
situated village of <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>.</p>
  <p>As we pass through St. Giles's Fields we shall
probably see a body of soldiers encamped in the
open ground, and perhaps encounter a gang of poor
wretches marching towards the City in chains. For
here, within a few days, has been held a meeting of
the followers of Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham;
and here they have been set upon by the young
King, Henry V., in person, and made prisoners.
The King has been told by his religious advisers
that the followers of the new religion design nothing
less than the subversion of his throne; and, therefore,
short time is allowed for question or investigation:
thirty Lollards expiate their supposed crime on the
gallows, while their leader escapes to Wales. Nor is
his fate eventually preferable to theirs, for in a year
or two he is taken, and, his legs having been broken,
he is hung up in his armour and roasted to death
over a slow fire.</p>
  <p>Beyond the road by which we have arrived at
<placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName> from the Strand, and running nearly parallel




        <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>

 to it, is St. Martin's-lane. Commencing at the
village of Charing, it passes St. Martin's Chapel, on
the site of which a church was erected by Henry
VIII., then really <quote> in the fields,</quote> like St. Giles's,
and a little farther on, the entrance to the great
Reading-road, now <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>. The foot of the lane
at Charing is marked by a cross, sacred to the
memory of Queen Eleanor, the wife of Edward I.
Some have fancifully derived the name of Charing
from  the French words chere reine, referring to
Edward's love for his queen; but, unfortunately
for such a pretty idea, the village has borne the
same appellation from Saxon times. Near the cross
is the magnificent palace of the Archbishops of
York, surrounded by pleasant gardens, and a park
which stretches away to Westminster. This palace
was afterwards known as Whitehall, the gardens as
Spring Gardens, and the park as St. James's.</p>
  <p>Near the cross, where now stand the Nelson
Column and Sir Edwin Landseer's lions, was an
aviary or mews for the King's hawks. The word
<soCalled> mew</soCalled> signifies, in the technical language of falconry, a moulting-place.  That falcons were in
great esteem in those days will be proved by the
fact that,-unless the law has been very recently
repealed-it is still felony, by Act of Parliament, to
steal a hawk. The following extract from the Wardrobe Accounts of Edward I. relates to the royal
mews at <placeName key="Charing-cross">Charing-cross</placeName>:--<quote>For timber whereof to
make the King's mews, and carriage of the same




<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>

from Kingston to the said mews as well by land as
by water: divers keys for the same, and for repairing the keys of the gerfalcon's bath: for iron rings
for the curtain of the mews before the said falcons:
and for turfs bought for the herbary of the said falcons . . . &#x00A3;25 . Os. . 2d.</quote> This sum represents no
less than &#x00A3;500 of our money, not counting the
twopence. It was in the same days that the Bishop
of Hereford paid his falconer 3s. 4d. a half-year!
The royal mews remained here as stables until the
reign of George IV.</p>
  <p>We must pass for the present the great palace of
the Savoy, of which the twice-restored chapel still
remains to this nineteenth century; and returning
towards the City by the Oxford-road, we find ourselves at the top of <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>-hill. In the valley
below runs the Fleet, and frowning from the opposite steep we see the city towers, and high above
them all, to the right, the spire of St. Paul's, at that
time the tallest steeple in Christendom, if, as some
say, it was 180 feet higher than the ball and cross on
the top of Sir <persName key="Wren, Christopher">Christopher Wren</persName>'s dome. Immediately opposite us we see the tower of St. Sepulchre's, just at the top of the hill, and outside the
fortifications of Newgate; and as we begin to descend,
we pass St. Andrew's on the right and the palace
of the Bishop of Ely on the left.  This palace was
famous for its gardens, which are referred to by
Shakespeare.  Hatton-garden and Ely place preserve for us indications of the site.</p>




                  <pb id="p.43" n="43"/>

  <p>A little farther up on the slope we pass through
crocus beds (now Saffron-hill), and find ourselves at
the entrance of Cow-lane, by which we ascend the hill
and enter <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName>. Cow-lane has but few houses
in it. It is not a pleasant place in which to live;
for just at the end, as we emerge on the open
space, we pass a spot known as the Elms; and
if you are curious in such matters, you may
see the great elmwood gibbets, placed here by
Henry III. Perhaps as you go by some of Lord
Cobham's unhappy followers are still suspended on
them.</p>
  <p>Crossing <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName>, we come to the porches of a
magnificent church, the west end of which projects
far into the open space. It is St. Bartholomew's
Church, and the priory buildings surround it. A
beautiful doorway leads into the south aisle of the
nave. This doorway is destined to remain a witness
to the splendour of the other buildings, and in the
days of Queen Victoria to form the entrance to St.
Bartholomew's Churchyard. But you care little to
look at the church or priory, for opposite the gate is
a post about three feet thick and eight high. It is
charred all over, as if it had been partially burnt.
It is sunk deep in the ground at the foot, and has
two or three iron staples and rings driven into each
side. You shudder and pass on.</p>
  <p>Turning to the right, with the wall on your left
hand, you follow what is now Giltspur-street, where
probably races were held, as well as tournaments.






<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>

We must not delay to tell any old stories of the
joustings here, but proceed at once past St. Sepulchre's Church, to enter the City through the New
Gate, which King Henry has just completed, and
which is already full of prisoners. If you are charitably disposed you will stop to put a farthing or two
into the bag which you see hanging by a long string
from one of the windows; and if you are rich, perhaps you will put in a penny, equal to a shilling at
least of modern coinage. The bag is quickly drawn
up and emptied by the poor starving wretches above.
Frightful stories have been told of the condition of
Newgate and all the prisons of those days; nor did
they much improve until a period but little removed
from our own. Strange to say, they were almost
all either private property or were leased to a private individual, who made what he could out of the
necessities of his miserable charge.</p>
  <p>As you proceed through Newgate-street, you perceive that all along the left hand of the way the
space is occupied by another monastery. This time
it is the Grey Friars. The church, which is at the
extremity of the street, is very magnificent. In
later times, after the great fire, it was pulled down,
and the present Christ Church built on part of the
site; but in the reign of Henry V. the visitor was
able to see some very remarkable tombs within its
walls. These tombs were wantonly destroyed by a
Lord Mayor of Queen Elizabeth's time. Among
others, you might have seen the monuments of four






                 <pb id="p.45" n="45"/>

queens-Margaret of France, the second wife of
Edward I.; her niece, the wicked Isabella, whom
Gray calls the  <quote>She-wolf of France;</quote>  her daughter,
Joane of the Tower, Queen of Scotland; and Isabel
Fitzwarren, in her own right Queen of the Isle of
Man. Near them lies the body of Roger Mortimer,
Earl of March, the infamous companion of Queen
Isabella; to whom belongs the unenviable distinction of having been the first person hanged at
<placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>. As if in mockery of death, we read that
upon Queen Isabella's breast, in the tomb, was
deposited the heart of <quote>her murdered mate </quote> in a
golden vase.</p>
  <p>Opposite the Grey Friars stands the town mansion
of the great Earls of Warwick. Here in a few years
will be held the semi-regal court of the King-maker,
to whom the estate has descended by his marriage
with one of the heiresses of the last of the Beauchamps. A few steps farther and we are in Paternoster-row, so called from the number of text-writers
who lived there and in the neighbourhood of Ave
Maria-lane, Amen-corner, and so on. Here also lived
bead or rosary makers, which were popularly called
paternosters and aves. The row was, if possible,
narrower than it is now, and was bordered on one
side by the wall of the great Cathedral-close. The
wall is overhung with trees, probably belonging to
gardens of the great Earl in Warwick-lane, and of
the great Bishop whose palace formed part of the
cathedral buildings. Among the Public Records is






<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>

one of an inquest held on a boy who was killed by
falling from the bough of an apple-tree in Paternoster-row.</p>
  <p>At the north-east end of the Close is an archway;
and here, if you are so disposed, you may enter to
hear the sermon at Paul's Cross. Any description
of the great cathedral would require a paper to
itself; so we will not pause now, but enter Cheape
or Cheapside, the great market-place of the City.
It is very narrow; there is hardly room for one
horse to pass along the centre of the street in most
places; yet this is the chief thoroughfare towards
St. Paul's and Ludgate-hill, as well as towards
Newgate. The best way in those days, although the
longest, was to turn down Old Change and through
Carter-lane and Creed-lane; the way through St.
Paul's Churchyard was altogether stopped by the
cathedral precincts. Cheapside is full, in the wider
parts, not only of shops, but of open stalls where
all kinds of merchandise are exposed for sale.</p>
  <p>London was already famous for the importance
of its trade. The Hall of the Mercers' Company,
one of the chief guilds of the City, stood about halfway along the street upon the site of the house in
which the great <persName key="Thomas, a Becket">Thomas Becket</persName> was born.   His
father was a citizen and mercer of London, but
there is no truth in the romantic story of his
mother's Saracenic origin.</p>
  <p>At the entrance to Cheapside, where a road or
street leads towards Aldersgate, is the market cross;





                  <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>

and as you go along you see the localities devoted
to the different wares which are sold here: Bread-
street, Milk-street, Honey-lane, and at the farther
end the Poultry market, may be noticed. There is
no open space opposite the Mansion House; in
fact there is no Mansion House; the Lord Mayor
lives in his own house, and entertains in the hall of
the Company to which he belongs. Half way up the
street is Guildhall, and opposite it Bow Church. In
the open space between a great tournament was
held in <date value="1329">1329</date> by Edward III., when a scaffolding
fell, by which several persons were injured. Edward
in a fury ordered the carpenters to be instantly
hanged, but released them on Queen Philippa's
intercession. At the extremity of Cheapside stands
a church, where the Royal Exchange was built
three centuries later; and another, St. Christopher's,
where the Bank of England afterwards rose.</p>
  <p>You will have perceived that the number of
churches in London is very great. Two centuries before the time of King Henry V. they were
reckoned at 126 parish churches, besides the chapels
of thirteen convents, and no fewer than seventy
chantries and chapels attached to St. Paul's. The
steeples of some of these churches were higher than
any in modern London; and as there was not much
smoke to obscure the view, the City must have
looked very beautiful from a distance. That there
was little smoke we infer from the fact that coal
was still rare in London, and that, so unwholesome






<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>

were its fumes considered, we hear of a man having
been hanged for using it in the reign of Edward I.
Indeed, nothing strikes us more when we study
those times than the ease with which a man might
get himself hanged; and it seems strange that three
centuries were passed before our legislators learned
the wisdom of the saying, <quote>It is the worst use to
which you can put a man.</quote></p>
  <p>Proceeding on our way through Cornhill, we pass
St. Michael's Church, and, a little farther on, the
street which leads to one of the outlets of the wall
at Bishopsgate. Just within the gate we see the
magnificent mansion which Sir John Crosby has
almost completed. A bystander will perhaps inform
us that the ground belongs to the prioress of St.
Helen's (another convent !), and that Sir John pays
her &#x00A3;11 6s. 8d. per annum for the lease. In the
hall of the mansion you may see one of the first
fireplaces used in England in such a building. Logs
were usually burnt in the centre of the floor, and
the smoke escaped-or, more probably, did not escape-by a hole in the roof. It was, therefore,
customary on great occasions to burn spices and
sweet-scented wood in those places. During the third
mayoralty of Sir Richard Whittington, in <date value="1419">1419</date>, he
entertained King Henry and his bride Katherine of
France at a sumptuous banquet in Guildhall; and
when they remarked upon the sweet perfume of the
fire which burned in the centre, Sir Richard replied

                   <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

 more pleasant; and drawing forth the bonds which
 he held of the King for more than &#x00A3;60,000, which
 the King had borrowed towards his French expedition, he threw them into the fire. This story must
 be taken for what it is worth; it is told of other great
 kings and merchants, at home and abroad, and is probably no more true than the other famous story of
 the same Sir Richard's cat, or the collateral one that
 he let all his lands upon leases for nine lives! It is,
 however, true that King Henry obtained large sums
 of money in the City for his French wars, and that
 he even pawned the royal crown of England for
 20,000 marks to the Bishop of Winchester.</p>
   <p>Pawnbroking was not confined to the natives of
 London in those days; and if we turn to the right
 out of Cornhill, through Gracechurch-street, we
 shall pass the head-quarters of the business in
 Lombard-street, so called on account of the immigration of Italian jewellers and other merchants,
 who here drove a thriving trade in money-lending.
 The sign of the pawnbroker-the three golden balls
 -is derived from the arms of the great Medici, Dukes
 of Florence, which some of these merchants have
 hung over their doors in honour of their native
 sovereigns. This reminds us to observe that none of
 the houses are numbered, but that every shop has its
 sign, as taverns, brokers, barbers, and gold-beaters
have still. The lighting of the streets as well as the
numbering has been neglected hitherto; but in the
beginning of this King's reign, Sir Henry Barton,






<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>

the Lord Mayor, ordered the streets to be lighted
with lamps, which was first done in the year <date value="1416">1416</date>.</p>
  <p>Passing the end of Lombard-street, we find ourselves in another market, called Eastcheap; and
among the taverns which surround it we shall probably be shown the <soCalled>Boar's Head,</soCalled> in which, according to the popular belief, King Henry in his
younger days has had many a frolic with his fat
friend Sir John Fastolf. Sir John, however, has
married a rich widow at Castle Combe, in Wiltshire,
and settled down as a country gentleman, and is just
now engaged in a lawsuit with his step-son, whom he
hopes to keep out of the inheritance during his own
lifetime; and King Henry has not less altered his
manner of life, and is feasting, as we have seen,
with the Lord Mayor instead of Dame Quickly.</p>
  <p>From Eastcheap to the Tower is but a short way,
and at the period we speak of, Tower-street would
probably be full of young men on their way to join
the great army which the King requires in France.
Henry V. probably resides at the Tower just now,
and with him his bride, Katherine of France. You
had better not ask too many questions about the
other queen, Henry's step-mother, who also perhaps
is in residence here; those who show too much
interest in her will probably be suspected of Lollardism; as Joan of Navarre has been lately accused
of sorcery on account of her well-known leanings
towards the followers of Cobham and Wickliffe.</p>
  <p>We must not now delay to visit the Tower, but






<pb id="p.51" n="51"/>

 proceed at once to London Bridge in order to reach
 the Borough before dark. This bridge is the only
 one over the Thames in London. You cannot cross
 otherwise , except by boat. The bridge is covered
 with buildings, a gateway being at each end; and
 as you pass in through the archway and pay your
 toll, you could imagine yourself in a street and forget the river altogether, but for the noise of the
 mill-wheels which are worked under every arch by
 the rush of water through the narrow aperture. A
 roaring sound like this would be most appropriate
 in a modern street; but we must remember that
 in those days there were few or no carts or carriages, especially in the streets, and that the only
 sounds were those of human voices, or the trampling of horses, with the occasional clanking of a man
 in armour as he rode along.</p>
 <p>Half way across is St. Thomas's Chapel, in which
 the engineer who built the bridge, Peter, curate of
 Colechurch in the City, lies buried.  He died in
 <date value="1205">1205</date>, and his bridge stood until <date value="1832">1832</date>!    The
 housess built upon it were crowded with inhabitants.
 In the reign of Richard II. they fell into deep disgrace, for the King's mother, the widow of Edward
 the Black Prince, was insulted and pelted as she
 passed under one of the arches in a boat. Richard,
 who was always glad of an excuse for getting money
It of the citizens, made them pay a heavy fine for
  This offence.  The same insult had been offered
  many years before to Eleanor of Provence, the


<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>

mother of Edward I. Over the gate at the Southwark end you will see the blackened skulls of some
of the victims of the usurpation of Henry IV.; and
will perhaps remember that, like the water gate at
the Tower, this is called the Traitor's Gate.</p>
  <p>If you look back at the City from the southern
end of the bridge you get a very fair idea of the
extent of it, and of the comparative sizes of the
various buildings with which it is adorned. The
limits are very sharply defined by the Tower on the
right or eastern side, and the buildings of the
Temple on the left. In the centre, towering above
all competition, stands the great cathedral, with its
glorious spire; while the other most prominent
churches are those of St. Mary-le-Bow, in Cheapside; St. Michael's, in Cornhill; and the Grey Friars,
near Newgate. Nearer the water's edge you observe
the great pile of Baynard's Castle, within the City
walls, near Blackfriars; and outside, the New
Temple, Arundel House, the Savoy, Whitehall, and
far in the west the clock tower of the royal palace
at Westminster, the huge spireless shape of the
Abbey, and the roof of Westminster Hall.</p>
  <p>Of these, Arundel House is the seat of the great
Earls of Arundel and Surrey; and Baynard's Castle
is the present domicile of a lady whose children are
to play a very prominent part in the affairs of the
kingdom during the next forty years of the fifteenth
century. Here Cicely, Duchess of York, mother of
Edward IV., keeps a kind of court. She is cousin






                   <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>

of the King-maker, being herself a Neville, the
daughter of his uncle the Earl of Westmoreland. I
speak more at length of her in my chapter on
Berkhamsted.</p>
   <p>Near the foot of London Bridge stands the church
 of St. Mary Overies, otherwise called St. Saviour's.
 It is one of the largest and handsomest churches in
 London; and is destined to be the only one of any
 importance, after Westminster Abbey, which will
 survive till the nineteenth century. It forms a kind
 of cathedral for the Bishop of Winchester, who resides in a magnificent palace not far off, and who
 holds occasionally a court in the Lady-chapel for
 the trial of heretics. In the church is a monument
 over the burial-place of Sir John Gower, the poet of
 the reign of King Edward III.</p>
   <p>Surrounding the church are some of the oldest
buildings in London; and in fact some antiquaries
have been of opinion that Southwark is more ancient
than the City to which it belongs on the opposite
bank:. In the principal street you will see an inn,
just then becoming famous as the scene of part of
a poem by one <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Geoffrey Chaucer</persName>. He was Clerk of
the Works at Westminster, and has recently died
      been buried near his royal master, Richard
   II., whose bones the young King had removed
       Langley, in Hertfordshire, and laid beside
       of his wife in the Confessor's Chapel. The
     <soCalled>Tabard</soCalled> Inn, as you pass by, is probably crowded
     pilgrims setting off for a visit to the shrine of






<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>

St. Thomas of Canterbury, and some of them have
perhaps taken the opportunity to say a prayer and
leave a gift at the same saint's chapel on London
Bridge.</p>

<p>IT is difficult now-a-days to arrive at any very
distinct idea of the condition of our forefathers a few
centuries ago. The progress of antiquarian research
within the last fifteen or twenty years has, however,
been so great, that it is easier for us to form some






                  <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>

conception of their mode of life, especially in large
towns, than it would have been before so many
volumes of research had been made public. This is
particularly the case with respect to London. We
have very full accounts before us of the architecture,
the laws, the customs, the dress, the language, and
even the food of the people of the Metropolis in the
Middle Ages; and from them we should be able to
approximate to those of other parts of England at
the same period, always allowing a few years for the
higher civilisation of places near to, than of places
more remote from, the great centre of progress and
activity.</p>
  <p>Still, with all the help these archeological investigations afford, it is hard to conceive the state of
people who lived without what to us are such ordinary things as glass windows, or oil paint, or
writing paper, or printed books. Yet in London, in
the year <date value="1400">1400</date>, such things were almost, some of
them quite, unknown. Street lamps were introduced
by Sir Henry Barton, Lord Mayor in <date value="1416">1416</date>. Chimneys were often made of wood before <date value="1419">1419</date>, when it
was ordered that any henceforth constructed except
of stone, tiles, or plaster, should be pulled down.
Glass was very dear, and only made in small pieces,
so that few completely glazed windows were to be
seen except in churches; and the poorer citizens
were obliged to content themselves with lattices, of
with very small windows almost filled up with stone
or wooden tracery. In the houses of some of the






<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>

wealthy nobility, sets of glass windows were removable, and were taken from place to place, as their
owner changed his residence. Crockery was almost
unknown, except as a great rarity from Italy; and
a glass or majolica basin or drinking cup was worth
more than its weight in gold. The common people
used horn, or perhaps in some cases iron cups and
drinking-vessels, and the richer sort silver, silvergilt, and even gold.</p>
  <p>Crosby Hall, which still remains, and is now
very appropriately turned into an eating-house,
gives us a fair idea of what the houses of the upper
class in London were like in the time of Richard
III.; but this is an extremely magnificent example,
and the houses of people in an inferior rank were
very different. Not, indeed, that such a house as
Crosby Hall would be considered comfortable now-
a-days. The vast rooms, the thorough draughts,
the badly fitting doors, the smoky chimneys, and
the very imperfect drainage and ventilation must
have more than made up for the beauty of the
carving, and the magnificence of the hangings on
the walls-or for the general splendour of the
furniture, and richness of the stained glass. The
town house of the Earls of Warwick in Newgate-
street; Baynard's Castle, in which the Duchess of
York, mother of Edward IV., lived; Pembroke Place,
on the site of which stands Stationers' Hall; and
Arundel House, in the Strand, were all very similar;
varying more in size than in general arrangement.</p>






                  <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>

  <p>In these fine mansions a visitor would have found
a strange mixture of luxury and barbarism. He
would have seen the great hall used as a sleeping
place by the servants of the family-the bare floor
being their bed, and for a pillow a sheaf of rushes
or straw; while in the chambers of the master and
his equals he would have seen the most elaborate
and sumptuous couches, ornamented with heraldic
devices of the richest kind, hung with velvet or silk,
and constructed of the softest down. Linen sheets
would not be so common, and in many instances
he would only find the bed arranged for lying upon,
not in; but in others he would see counterpanes of
damask or satin, and sheets of the finest cloth of
Cambray, or cambric. The word counterpane is
derived from the practice of <soCalled>paning</soCalled> or striping
various rich stuffs one with another. Our words
panel and pane are from the same source. The
walls would be hung with tapestry, generally ornamented with heraldic badges, but sometimes
embroidered with representations of scenes from
the romances and ballads which were popular at
the time.</p>
  <p>For furniture he would probably see in each
chamber a chair or two-generally what we should
call arm-chairs-or stools without any back; also
a seat in the thickness of the wall under the
window; and a wardrobe, sometimes of great magnificence, but often a mere curtained recess, in
which to hang clothes. A more important article




<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>

of furniture would be the chest, or cabinet, which
would also serve for a table, and would be richly
ornamented with hinges, and perhaps painted or
carved with shields of arms. The visitor would
probably see no looking-glass, or else only a small
hand-mirror of metal; he would not find any
washhand-stand-though there might be a bath-
and he would miss a fireplace, though he might
see a brazier with charcoal. The door would be
protected with heavy curtains, and the window
would not be made to open and shut; nevertheless
he would find a plentiful supply of the outer air
circulating in the room, some coming through
the imperfectly leaded window panes, some under
the ill-fitting door, and a great deal through the
boards of the floor, from whatever room chanced
to be beneath, as ceilings were seldom plastered,
and floors seldom carpeted. Carpets were more
commonly used for wall hangings, though we read
of their use for the floors in the king's palace as
early as the reign of Edward III. There would be
no hair brushes, though combs were in common
use; and no pins, though brooches like skewers,
but ornamented with jewels, would be found; metal
pins were first made about the reign of Edward IV.
A smaller bed would probably be found at the foot
of the great one, for a servant or a guard; and a
little oratory would probably occur in one corner,
fitted with an image, a little reliquary, containing
perhaps a piece of the <soCalled>true cross,</soCalled> and a <soCalled>pater-noster,</soCalled>







                 <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>

or rosary of beads. In a few cases you
might also find a volume of prayers, or the <soCalled>Book
of Tribulation,</soCalled> containing the seven penitential
psalms; and in another part of the room, a volume
of the Romaunt of Sir Lancelot du Lac, or a
Chronicle of the Wars.</p>
  <p>Descending to the reception rooms of the house,
you would be struck by the general want of furniture everywhere apparent. In the great hall there
would be forms at either side of a long table, which
itself would consist of boards laid upon trestles, and
removed after each meal. The forms would then
be set back against the wall, or taken away altogether. A cross table at the upper end of the hall
would be provided for the lord of the mansion, who,
with his wife and the principal guests, would sit
under a canopy, which would be not so much a
matter of state as of necessity, for protection from the
draughts. The servants, and indeed all the family,
high or low, except those actually engaged in cooking or waiting, would dine together; and dinner
would be the principal meal of the day, a slight
breakfast and a slighter supper preceding and
following it. The Duchess of York dined at eleven
in the forenoon, and supped at five. These early
hours were general: the Judges at Westminster
sat only from eight in the morning until eleven,
when they adjourned for the day. No doubt the
difficulty of performing any labour, literary or
manual, except by daylight, led to these arrangements.



<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>

Candle-light was bad, and candles dear;
the only light always available during the short
days of winter being that of the fire which burnt in
the middle of the hall-the smoke escaping by the
louvre in the roof. The hall of Westminster School
was warmed in this way until the year <date value="1850">1850</date>, if not
later; and the same old method may still be seen
in occasional use at Penshurst Place, in Kent.
Crosby Hall gives us the earliest example of a great
hall with a fireplace. It was almost impossible,
without a chimney or any certain exit for the
smoke, to burn coal; and we have already seen
that the smoke of coal was considered so unwholesome that its use was prohibited in London by the
severest enactments until the middle of the fourteenth century, and was by no means common for
a hundred years later.</p>
  <p>Westminster Hall was completed by Richard II.
in <date value="1390">1390</date>. Accounts of the <soCalled> house warming</soCalled> which
he gave in celebration of this event have come
down to us, and give us a lively picture of the
table arrangements of the period. The prices of
provisions may also be easily ascertained by a
reference to the market regulations made at different
times. These prices were always much affected by
the visitations of the plague, which were so common
in Old London. For example, after the plague of
the year <date value="1348">1348</date>, in which 100,000 persons are said
to have died, a fat ox might have been bought for
4s., and a fat wether for 4d. A lamb was 2d., and






                 <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>

a pig 5d. Even if we allow that money is now
fifteen times more valuable, these are exceedingly
low rates. The usual prices were much higher.
One schedule gives us these particulars: between
Easter and Whit-Sunday a fat goose was to be had
for 5d., at other times for 4d., or even 3d. Three
pigeons came to a penny; which is not very cheap
if we calculate a penny as worth between 1s. 3d.
and 1s. 8d. of our money. The swan was much
esteemed at the great City feasts, and cost the prodigious sum of 3s., equal to nearly &#x00A3;2 10s. in
modern currency. There were many swans on the
Thames; the King's birds and those belonging to
the citizens being distinguished by markings annually made on their bills. The common tavern
sign, a swan with Two Necks, properly nicks, has
its rise from this circumstance. Salmon were from
3s. to 5s. each, which multiplied by 15, answers pretty
nearly to the present price; whilst oysters were at
2d. a gallon, which, on the same calculation, is
certainly cheap. A prominent feature at all great
entertainments was a peacock served <quote>in his
pride,</quote> with the feathers and train; as we still see
pheasants at table, with the tail-feathers by way of
garnishing.</p>
  <p>When Richard II. gave the feast at Westminster
Hall of which I have spoken, he employed, we
read, 2,000 cooks, and is said to have feasted at
one time above 10,000 persons. Many particulars
have come down to us of this and other extravagant





<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>

banquets of the unfortunate Richard, but none
seems to have exceeded the magnificent pageant
displayed by the City of London at the time of his
coronation; when, among other things, we read of
the following <soCalled>sotylty</soCalled> or device which was exhibited in the street at Cheapside. <quote>At the upper
end of Chepe,</quote> says the chronicler, <quote>was a certaine castell made with foure towers, out of the
which castell, on two sides of it, there ran foorth
wine abundantlie. In the towers were placed
foure beautifull virgins, of stature and age like to
the King, apparelled in white vestures, in every
tower one, the which blew in the King's face, at his
approaching neere to them, leaves of gold ....
When he was come before the castell, they took
cups of gold, and, filling them with wine at the
spouts of the castell, presented the same to the
King and to his nobles. On the top of the castell,
betwixt the foure towers, stood a golden angell,
holding a crowne in his hands, which was so contrived that when the King came, he bowed downe
and offered him the crowne.</quote></p>
  <p>This was a <quote>sotylty</quote> on a very large scale, but
similar devices were common at table; heraldry
being called in to help, and great pains, if not great
taste, being shown in their composition. Thus at
the coronation feast of Queen Katherine, wife of
Henry V., we read that there was <quote>a sotylty called
a pellycan, sytting on his nest, with her byrdes and
an image of Seynt Katheryne holdyng a booke, and






                 <pb id="p.63" n="63"/>

disputynge with the doctours, holdyng a reason in
her right hande.</quote> This feast, which was held in
Lent, was remarkable. It consisted entirely of
fish, dressed in various ways; and included, besides
many kinds of salt and fresh water fish, the names
of which it is not very easy to identify, <quote>porpies
rostyd,</quote> and <quote>mennys fryed</quote>-porpoises and
minnows. At a feast given a few years before,
there were served at table, besides wild boar and
venison dressed in several ways, peacocks, cranes,
bitterns, egrets, curlews, partridges, quails, snipes,
and <quote>smal byrdys </quote>-perhaps sparrows.</p>
  <p>After this account of the high feeding of the
period, it may not be amiss to say something of
the state of medicine. The monks were the chief
physicians, and seem to have been but moderately
successful. Henry V. was, probably, killed by the
unskilfulness of his medical advisers. Their prescriptions are of inordinate length, and seem to be
compounded in a sort of wild hope that if one drug
fails, another may succeed. During visitations of
the plague, or any epidemic sickness, they appear
to have been utterly powerless; although they did
guess at the real cause of these disorders, as we
see from the many ordinances for the better cleansing
of the City, and for the abating of nuisances.  It
was unlawful, for instance, to keep pigs within certain
boundaries. But, no doubt, the stagnant moat
which surrounded the City walls, to say nothing of
that which protected the Tower, was enough to







<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>

account for the awful visitations of pestilence to
which the people were so frequently subjected.</p>
  <p>The names of two or three of the eminent physicians of those days have come down to us. Master
Lawrence was Queen Isabella's medical adviser;
but we cannot say much for his skill when we read
that his royal patient's death was occasioned by a
too powerful dose of some medicine which, although
at her desire, he had administered to her. We
find that he was paid &#x00A3;2 for a whole month's
attendance. Another eminent practitioner was
Master Gun, or Quin, a monk at Bermondsey
Abbey, to which many royal and noble personages
resorted for the benefit of his advice. During one
such visit Queen Elizabeth Woodville, widow of
Edward IV., died.</p>
  <p>Surgery was no further advanced than medicine,
and a very slight wound was sure to be fatal.
Amputations were seldom attempted, and when
attempted were almost always unsuccessful. We
cannot wonder at this when we read that it was
customary, after a man's leg or arm had been
lopped off with an axe, to plunge the stump in
boiling pitch, in order to stop the bleeding. No
doubt this object was effectually accomplished!
There were some surgeons, nevertheless, not unskilful in reducing fractures and dislocations. A
magnificently illuminated MS. in the National
Library of Paris contains the English translation
of the treatise of Guy de Chauliac, an eminent






                 <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>

French surgeon, on the "Restorynge of Broken
Bones."</p>
  <p>The overcrowding of the poor in miserable hovels
in the City; and the want of pure water, are quite
sufficient to account for the fearful mortality caused
by the plague in various years. The worst visitation seems to have been that of <date value="1348">1348</date>, in which
100,000 are said to have died, as I mentioned
above; and it was rendered further memorable by
the munificence of Sir Walter Manny, who purchased a piece of ground outside the City walls,
and had it dedicated as a cemetery for those who
died of the plague. Fifty thousand corpses are said
to have been interred here during the prevalence of
the visitation; but this number is probably inaccurate and exaggerated. Sir Walter, who was
one of the first Knights of the Garter, and a famous
hero in the wars of Edward III., died in <date value="1372">1372</date>, and
was buried in this cemetery. He had given it into
the charge of a society of monks, of the Chartreuse
or Carthusian Order, who were afterwards violently
suppressed by Henry VIII. Their last prior was
hanged, drawn, and quartered at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, in <date value="1535-05">May 1535</date>;
and the site of the priory and burial-ground, by a
new foundation, became the famous Charterhouse
School, at which so many eminent men were educated in after years.</p>
  <p>Mention of Henry VIII. and his cruelty to the
Carthusians reminds me to say a few words about
what was a much more prominent feature in the

<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>

every-day life of London four hundred years ago
than it is now. Executions were at all times very
frequent. The English laws were very sanguinary,
and they seem to have been carried out with the
utmost rigour. There was hardly any punishment
for crime of all shades except death, the cruelty of
the mode of execution alone marking the heinousness of the crime. For ordinary offences hanging
was the usual punishment; but for heresy burning
alive at the stake, and for treason drawing and
quartering, were the regular formule. By an excess
of barbarity, women guilty of capital crimes were
usually burnt alive; and burning the body
after strangling continued to obtain in England
until the end of the eighteenth century. On this
subject I shall have more to say in the next paper.</p>
  <p>The continual shedding of blood by the English
law seems to our modern ideas very horrible; but,
in reality, there was in those days little choice
between death and imprisonment. The City prisons
were in so shocking a state of unwholesomeness
and filth, that pestilence was constantly raging
within their walls. In the year of the accession of
Henry V. sixty-four prisoners at Newgate, together
with all the turnkeys and the chief jailor, were
carried off by one such fever. After Whittington's
death his executors rebuilt Newgate Prison, as an
act of charity, under the provisions of his will.
But the condition of poor prisoners was not much
ameliorated, and pestilence and misery reigned






                   <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>

supreme for more than two centuries longer. Besides
Newgate, there were two smaller prisons, under the
control of the sheriffs. One of them was in Cheapside, and the other, which remained until a few
years ago, in Giltspur-street. There was also the
King's Bench Prison, which was situated in Southwark. To it Chief Justice Gascoigne is said to
have committed Henry V. when Prince of Wales.
Notwithstanding the general opinion to the contrary which has so long prevailed, it is perfectly
certain that one of Henry's first acts at his accession was to deprive Gascoigne of his elevated office.
Nearly adjoining the King's Bench was the Marshalsea, so called from its being under the control
of the Marshal of the King's Household. Prisoners
for debt, and along with them, by a curious though
not unaccountable regulation, pirates, were confined
here until the time of its final discontinuance, in
<date value="1842">1842</date>.</p>
  <p>But the most remarkable as well as the largest
of the old debtors' prisons-the Fleet-stood close
to the spot at which the railway bridge now crosses
Ludgate-hill. The misery and misgovernment for
which this prison was notorious began almost at its
first institution; and many efforts to improve the
condition of the prisoners and the aspect of the
prison were made by charitably disposed persons
from time to time. The most remarkable during
the period of which we have been speaking was
that of Sir Stephen Foster and Dame Agnes, his






<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>

wife. Foster, who had been a small tradesman in
the City, was imprisoned in the Fleet for debt; and
it happened that one day, when he was begging at
the grated opening through which the unfortunate
debtors were permitted to behold the outer world
and to excite the compassion of the charitable,
a certain widow, who possessed wealth and was
willing to do good, asked him what sum would set
him  at liberty.  <quote>Twenty pounds,</quote> he replied.
The money was paid, and Foster became the servant of his benefactress; and in due time, having
by his diligence and integrity greatly advanced her
interests, he married her, and became a wealthy
citizen, serving the office of Lord Mayor in <date value="1454">1454</date>.
But in his prosperity he did not forget his sufferings
in the Fleet: he and his wife, having purchased
the adjoining houses, pulled them down, and enlarged the prison by the addition of a chapel, and
many other buildings, for the benefit of his former
companions, in order that, from the time of this
benefaction, they should not be obliged to pay out
of their scanty means for additional accommodation.
He also left a foundation for the office of chaplain,
and so wisely and carefully framed his regulations
that, notwithstanding the continual extortions of
the officials, this continued until the last century to
be esteemed the best and least oppressive prison
for debtors in England.</p>
  <p>The endowment by Sir Stephen Foster of the
Fleet Chapel reminds me to speak of the London






                 <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

churches of that day.  Within the walls they
were very numerous. The parishes, owing to the
large number of inhabitants in each, and their
crowded dwellings, were small in area, but enormously large in population; and two or more of
the churches often closely adjoined one another.
Thus St. Paul's, though not itself a parish church,
had the church of the parish of St. Faith in its
crypt, and the church of St. Gregory built against
its walls: St. Swithin's, in Cannon-street, stood
almost touching Abchurch; St. John's, Watling-
street, was close to St. Antholin's, and both were
just opposite St. Augustine's.</p>
  <p>But all these churches, and many more, were
destroyed in the Great Fire of <date value="1666">1666</date>, and very few
specimens of the older buildings have come down
to our time. The most remarkable are to be seen
in St. Bartholomew, <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName>, and St. Giles,
Cripplegate; and there is still a very beautiful
porch adjoining St. Sepulchre's, in Giltspur-street.
All these, however, were outside the City walls:
inside them there are but few remains of any importance. The church of All Hallows Barking, in
Tower-street, has some examples in different parts
of the building of the architecture of the fourteenth
century. Part of the crypt, too, of the old church
of St. Michael still exists under the houses at the
junction of Cornhill with Gracechurch-street; but
St. Andrew's Undershaft-that is, under the Maypole, which used to stand at the end of Cornhill-






<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>

although entirely in the old Pointed or Gothic style,
was not built as we now see it until a full century
after the period of which we are speaking.</p>
  <p>In addition to the number of parish churches,
the buildings of the monasteries were very numerous. There were two principal orders of monks
in London. They were all spoken of as the regular
clergy, in contradistinction to the secular, or
priests-that is, they lived according to certain rules
or regulations; and the different orders of monks
were distinguished among themselves by the system
of rules to which they adhered. The Cistercians,
the Carthusians, and the Augustinians might all be
classed as reformed Benedictines; and to the same
order almost all the abbeys and cathedrals in
England belonged. But in the thirteenth century
these  societies had become corrupted.   They
had all yielded more or less to the enervating
influence of wealth and prosperity; and although
each new sect, or denomination of monk, at its
first settlement in England endeavoured to fulfil
the rules of its founder, and by visiting the poor
and needy in their distress, and relieving their
wants, to do the work which in our days is so
differently performed, yet the corrupting influence of luxury soon began to tell upon each in
succession: and no matter how carefully the earlier
members of a fraternity framed its rules, their
successors eventually yielded to the temptations
of wealth and power, and departed from   their






                 <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

primitive simplicity, and then the orders became
one after another, in their turn, luxurious, proud,
tyrannical, and superstitious. As true piety died
out among them, the worship of relics, of images,
and of a daily increasing host of saints supplied
its place. In the thirteenth century these things
had come to such a pitch that the monks were
everywhere dreaded or despised, and only kept
their hold on the minds of the people by the superstitions which they fostered.</p>
  <p>In London and its neighbourhood the various
divisions of the Benedictine Order were especially
powerful. To them belonged the magnificent and
wealthy abbey of Westminster; Canterbury and
Rochester were also under their dominion, as well
as the stately foundation of St. Albans; and to
various denominations of the same Rule were assigned almost all the monasteries in London. St.
Bartholomew's, and St. Mary Overies at the foot of
London Bridge, were Augustinian, the monks of
which Order were generally known as Austin
Friars, but sometimes as White Friars. The Cluniac Order held Bermondsey Abbey, of which we
have already spoken; and the Carthusians the
magnificent foundation of the Charter House. There
were also monasteries of Carmelites and Cistercians,
who, however, preferred the country; and besides
all these, the semi-military orders of Templars and
Hospitallers. The Templars were originally lodged
in <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, and afterwards in Fleet-street; whilst






<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>

the Knights of St. John had their head-quarters at
Clerkenwell, in a noble building, the interesting old
gate of which is still to be seen, as well as the
crypt underneath their church.</p>
  <p>In addition to all these monks of the older
orders, the thirteenth century saw the rise of a new
and in many respects very different monastic
system. The Franciscans and Dominicans-both
founded by men who, as far as their light went,
were sincere and good, and who, when we consider
the age in which they lived, are entitled to our
admiration-had their origin within a few years of
each other, and rapidly spread throughout all the
countries of Europe. In England the Franciscans
were especially successful, and thirty years from
their first landing in <date value="1226">1226</date> had attained the large
number of 1,242 members, and possessed forty-nine
convents in different places throughout the kingdom.
We look in vain among the remains of Franciscan
monasteries for those glories of architecture so
commonly found in the ruins of the abbeys of the
older orders. They lived in hovels, and practised
the strictest austerities. By their founder's precept, they were bound to consider themselves
lower than the lowest: hence the name of <soCalled>Minorites,</soCalled> or <soCalled>Friars Minors,</soCalled> by which they were
known. St. Francis had forbidden them to apply
themselves to learning, by which term in those
days the ancient philosophies and the more modern
theologies were known: they therefore addicted





                    <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>

themselves to physical studies, and were the naturalists and mathematicians of the age. Roger
Bacon was a member of their order.       Bishop
Grosteste was their chief patron.  But it was for
their charities that they were best known-or rather
for their labours in distributing the charity of
others; for they themselves professed, and even to
the time of their dissolution under Henry VIII.
maintained, an austerity of manners which forbade
the acquisition of riches. Their chief church in
London was on the site of the chancel or choir
of Christ Church, Newgate-street; its ornaments,
and especially the stained glass windows for which
it was remarkable, were the gift of those who had
benefited from the preaching or ministrations of
members of the order, but the dwellings of the
brethren were not in accordance with the magnificence of their church.</p>
  <p>Besides their chief and oldest convent within
Newgate, they had a branch establishment near
the Tower: of this building, which has left its
name to the <soCalled>Minories,</soCalled> no remains exist; and of
the older house in Newgate-street we have only the
memories still attached to the Blue Coat School,
which now occupies the ground once covered with
the low-roofed dormitories, bleak cloisters, and
meagrely furnished refectories of the brotherhood. They were, especially at first, loved and
honoured by the immense population which partook
of their benevolence; and seem really to have






<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>

deserved such feelings by their devotion in times
of pestilence, and by the eloquence with which they
enforced from the pulpit the practical piety of their
lives.</p>
  <p>How different our great city must have looked to
the every-day observer at that period from anything
we are now acquainted with! Cheapside a long and
narrow market-place, more like an Oriental bazaar
than the busy and gloomy street now standing on
its site; the houses projecting above, so as almost
to meet in their upper storeys, and so as completely to shelter the open-air stall upon which
goods were displayed below; no sound of wheels in
the streets, or at most the slow, lumbering waggon
in which a great lady in bad health might choose
to travel to or from her town residence; the absence
of the dense smoke to which modern Londoners
are accustomed, and consequently the much gayer
dresses of all ranks of people.</p>
  <p>Here, a knight in plate armour, and with his
horse almost concealed under iron trappings, jogs
heavily and noisily over the pavement; a page
running by his side, a squire carrying his helmet
behind him, and a long train of ferocious-looking
soldiers, some on foot, some on horseback, but all
clad in their lord's colours, following behind in
single file on account of the narrowness of the
streets; there, a procession of white-robed monks,
each with his face concealed in a black hood, lead
the way to the burial of some eminent citizen, or






                <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>

convey the sacrament to some dying penitent;
here, perhaps, the Lord Mayor or a leading alderman, clad in a marone-coloured velvet robe, lined
throughout with fur, and wearing a scarlet silk suit
underneath, goes, attended by mace and sword
bearers, whose office was no sinecure among the
turbulent populace, to hold his court at Guildhall or
at Newgate; there, the shop of a herbseller in
Bucklersbury is besieged by a howling mob; while
its unhappy owner, suspected, perhaps, of complicity
in witchcraft with the Lollards, Lord Cobham, and
Queen Joanna, is led away to undergo that fatal
ordeal which leaves no hope of escape: if he is innocent, he drowns; if guilty, he floats, and is despatched by the stones and bludgeons of the crowd.</p>

<p>IN the two previous chapters I have endeavoured
to give some account of the City in the time of
Henry V. and his immediate predecessors and
successors, and also of the manners and customs
of the people by whom it was inhabited. In the
following pages I propose to conclude my account
of London four centuries ago by a few extracts
from its history under the rule of the family which
it is usual now to call that of Plantagenet, a name
which would scarcely have been recognised by any
of them. It is not on record that any king ever
used the name.</p>






<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>

  <p>Henry II., who ascended the throne in <date value="1154">1154</date>, was
the first of the family to reign in England. He
had an hereditary quarrel with the citizens. It was
chiefly, if not altogether, owing to their election of
King Stephen, whose right to the crown was of the
faintest kind, that Henry's mother, the Empress
Maud, was kept out of her just inheritance; and he
was not likely to neglect such a good excuse for
plundering the wealthy burghers. We are not surprised, therefore, to find that a contribution of 1,000
marks was exacted in <date value="1159">1159</date>. A mark is the third of
a pound, and a pound then was worth nearly &#x00A3;20
now. Again, they had to pay the same sum in
<date value="1172">1172</date>, and in the following year, besides a contribution of &#x00A3;666 13s. 4d. towards the expenses of
Henry's expedition to Ireland.</p>
  <p>And Henry's extortions are only a specimen of
what London had often to endure from his descendants. On the other hand, the citizens obtained
from the needy kings grants of privileges and exemptions from service, which laid the foundation of
their subsequent liberties. One curious consequence
of this relation between the kings and the London
merchants was, that those sovereigns who had no
hereditary right to the throne were generally the
most popular in the City, because they sought to
strengthen their position by conciliating the powerful and wealthy citizens.  So that those kings
whose title was worst were generally the best sovereigns, or at least the best liked in London; and






                 <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>

this we find to have been especially the case with
Henry IV., Henry V., and Richard III. It always
seemed that those kings were the strongest who
supported the privileges of the City, and that the
best hereditary right was not sufficient to counterbalance neglect of this principle. The weakest were
those who, like Henry III., Richard II., and Henry
VI., notwithstanding the prestige of a lengthened
succession in their family, were induced to build on
their hereditary rights, instead of preserving their
personal popularity. The success of Richard III.
was wholly owing to recollection of this fact; and,
indeed, the same may be said of Edward IV., who,
although his right to the throne was undoubted, lost
no opportunity of strengthening his position in the
affections of the London people. And I must not
neglect in this place to mention that, according to
many authorities, it was by grant from Richard III.
that the chief magistrate became a <soCalled>Lord</soCalled> Mayor.</p>
  <p>We cannot obtain a better idea of the relative
positions of the King and the citizens, than by seeing how Henry III. treated them during the mayoralty of Sir Thomas Fitz-Thomas, who was elected
to that office in <date value="1262">1262</date>, and again during each of the
two following years.  He was a bold man, and
opposed the oppressions of the Court with all his
power. For this he is maligned by the contemporary historians; and it is not easy to discover his
really brave and noble conduct under the accounts
they give of him. In <date value="1264">1264</date> Henry paid a visit to the






<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>

City; and, seated in state in St. Paul's Cathedral,
he received the unwilling homage of the citizens, to
whom his visit boded no good. <quote> Then,</quote> to quote
from the Chronicle,  <quote>those who were present might
see a thing wondrous and unheard-of in this age;
for this most wretched mayor, when taking the oath,
dared to utter words so rash as these, saying unto
his lordship the King, in presence of the people,
'My Lord, so long as unto us you will be a good
lord and king, we will be faithful and duteous unto
you.'</quote>  Sir Thomas is not the only mayor who is
said to have spoken such words as these to his
sovereign. A similar expression is to be seen on the
monument of Alderman Beckford, in the Guildhall.
He is said, but on questionable authority, to have
spoken thus to George III.</p>
  <p>Henry was deeply offended at the mayor's speech;
and when, in the following year, the citizens again
elected Fitz-Thomas, he determined to humble them
by force of arms. It seemed to him a thing not to
be borne that they should be able to call their earnings their own, or to elect again a mayor who had
so deeply insulted their king as only to promise him
obedience during his good behaviour! He therefore
called to him at Windsor all the earls and barons
whom he could persuade to support his cause; and
pronouncing the citizens his foes, he prepared to
besiege London. They in the meanwhile, knowing
the King's ungovernable temper, and knowing,
moreover, that they could not but lose in any






                 <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>

struggle with so powerful an adversary, determined
to throw themselves on his mercy, and make the
best terms they could.</p>
  <p>The King's terms were very hard,-they were to
surrender to him unconditionally. This they at
length agreed to do. The agreement was drawn up
and sealed, and now Henry showed his real designs.
He summoned the mayor and principal citizens to
Windsor, offering them letters of safe-conduct,
which, as you will see, he had not the slightest idea
of observing. When they reached the castle, late on
a Sunday afternoon, he kept them waiting until the
evening, when he sent them a message that he could
not see them until the morrow; at the same time
they were invited to enter, and were lodged in what is
now the Round Tower or Keep. There they waited
that night and the following day till evening, when
they were separated and put into different prisons
within the castle. The safe-conduct went for nought.</p>
  <p>In the meantime the King and his knights started
for London, where the citizens, suspecting nothing,
were awaiting the return of Fitz-Thomas and their
other friends. The King called them all his enemies, and, riding with his soldiers through the
streets, treated them as if he had conquered them in
war and by force of arms. He immediately seized
violently no fewer than sixty houses of those who
had offended him, and gave them to his own followers, turning the unhappy inhabitants out-of-doors.
He then went on through the City to the Tower, and






<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>

appointed the constable, Sir Hugh Fitz-Otes, or
Otho, to govern London as warden or seneschal,
suspending the office of mayor altogether.</p>
  <p>When the unfortunate deputation had been imprisoned at Windsor for about three weeks, they were
liberated-all, that is, except five, who were detained
there for nearly three months, and only set at
liberty when the citizens had paid the enormous
fine of 20,000 marks, equal to not less than
&#x00A3;100,000 of our money. Besides this, the prisoners
were obliged to make over their lands and possessions to the King, who granted them as he pleased
to his knights. These citizens were always afterwards known on this account as the disherisoned, or
those whose inheritance had been taken away.</p>
  <p>Henry continued to govern the City by wardens
for five years, much against the will of the people,
who demanded only Sir Thomas Fitz-Thomas for
their ruler, and who were therefore constantly in
hot water during the time the wardens continued to
hold power. They at that time called themselves
by the proud name of <soCalled> The Commons of England,</soCalled>
and in those hanging days showed no slight amount
of courage and constancy in the cause of their
rights and liberties against the usurpations of the
Court. But now a new actor appeared on the scene.
Gilbert, third Earl of Gloucester, of the Clare
family-like his father Richard, second Earl, and
his grandfather, one of the famous Magna Charta
barons-had always been attached to the popular






                 <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

cause in the civil commotions of the reign of Henry
III.  He went by the name of the <soCalled>Red Earl,</soCalled> on
account of his hair or of his armour, or possibly of
both. Just at this time he had raised a force in
support of the barons against the King; and having
been summoned by the Pope's legate, who then
resided at the Tower, to answer before him for disturbing the peace of the kingdom, he came indeed,
but brought with him his army, and took possession
of the City.  He then set himself to bring the
government into better order, and if possible to
make peace between the King and his subjects. His
notions of justice were peculiar, and his method of
carrying out his decrees rough and ready. Certainly
he seems to have been at least impartial, and many
stories have been told of his summary mode of dealing with all disturbers of the peace. He caused
daily proclamation to be made against acts of depredation, and did not spare some of his own soldiers
who had been concerned in a fatal quarrel with
certain of the citizens; he had four of them tied
hand foot and thrown headlong into the Thames.
Eventually a peace was patched up between the
King and the citizens; and Gloucester's rule in the
City, after having lasted about six weeks, came to
an end. It was this same earl who was Montfort's
friend, and who afterwards, by his timely action and
decision, secured the succession of the Crusader,
Edward I., during his absence in Palestine, on his
father's death.</p>




<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>

  <p>Early in <date value="1267">1267</date>, Henry III. renewed the City
charter, under certain conditions. What became of
Sir Thomas Fitz-Thomas is not ascertainable. He
had probably died, either during his confinement or
soon after. In <date value="1269">1269</date> a list was made of those banished during this contest, and his name does not
occur among the number.</p>
  <p>This is only one example of Henry's method of
treating the Londoners. They were objects of continual persecution on his part, chiefly because of
their wealth, and the jealousy with which they
guarded any encroachment on their liberties. The
King was in continual pecuniary difficulties. The
expenses he incurred by his lavish gifts to the needy
foreigners who came over to England with his wife,
Eleanor of Provence; and especially to her uncle,
Peter de Savoy; coupled with his own reckless profusion and the great buildings which he erected-
including his palace at Westminster and the Abbey
there-all caused him to seek any method of persuasion or oppression by which he might obtain
money. During some of his periodical difficulties
he was advised to sell his jewels, which were of
great value. <q type="spoken">Who will buy them ?</q> he asked.
 <q type="spoken">The citizens of London,</q>" was the reply. <q type="spoken">By my
troth,</q> he cried in a fury, <q type="spoken">if the treasures of
Augustus were to be sold, those citizens would store
them up! Those clowns, who assume to call themselves barons, abound in all things, whilst I am
without even necessaries.</q> It will not, however,





                 <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

surprise us to find him thus complaining of poverty
when we remember some of his extravagances.
Thus in <date value="1244">1244</date> he spent on the buildings at Westminster upwards of &#x00A3;40,000 in modern reckoning;
and in <date value="1246">1246</date> he assigned &#x00A3;2,591, equal to about
&#x00A3;50,000 modern, which was due to the treasury
from the widow of one David, a Jew of Oxford, to
the building of the Abbey.</p>
  <p>The most remarkable events in the City during
the reign of Edward I. were connected with the
Scotch wars in which that king engaged.   On
August 23, <date value="1305">1305</date>, Sir William Wallace, who had
been brought from Scotland a few days before, was
hanged at <soCalled>The Elms,</soCalled> in <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName>; his body
was quartered, and his limbs were sent to different
Scotch towns, while his head was placed upon
London Bridge. A little later in the same year,
Fraser, a servant of Wallace, and two other Scotch
knights, were executed in the same cruel manner,
the body of Fraser, however, being burnt; and in
the following year another unfortunate Scot, the
Earl of Athol, shared the same fate.  Nor did.
Edward's severity rest here, but in <date value="1307">1307</date>, shortly
before his own death, a brother of Wallace, together
with two brothers of Robert Bruce, were hanged
at the same place and under similarly barbarous
circumstances.</p>
  <p>London was always deeply interested in the wars.
The money with which any expedition was paid
for came out of the pockets of London merchants.






<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>

Nor was this the only reason for their warlike spirit.
We find that almost all the armour, which was then
so important a means of defence, came from the
City. On hearing of the invasion of Louis the
Dauphin, in the early part of the reign of Henry
III., the merchants sent the King 60,000 coats of
mail. The citizens themselves were-all, at least,
who could bear arms-accustomed to martial exercises, and took part in most of the expeditions to
France under Edward III. and Henry V.; and in
the wars of the Roses they were equally active,
either on one side or other, or else in their own defence. Thus, during a meeting of the heads of the
rival parties, attended by a large number of followers, order was kept in the City by the mayor
with 5,000 men, completely armed, whilst three
aldermen watched with another force of 2,000 during
the night. Of all the City companies, that of the
Armourers was of the most importance, and even
the great Edward himself was a member of it. Every
king of England since his time has belonged to some
City company. Edward's French wars were always
popular in the City, and the armourers no doubt
derived the greatest benefit from them. Iron in those
days came from the hills and valleys of Sussex and
Kent, which were full of small furnaces for extracting the precious ore from the red earth. Remains
of their shallow pits and burnt-out fires are often
met with; and it may be of interest in this place
to mention that Walter the Smith, otherwise known






                  <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>

as Wat Tyler, of Hilliard, who, in the early part of
the reign of Richard II., headed the Kentish insurrection, was one of these iron-founders. Perhaps
also we may note here, that the dagger or sword in
the City arms, generally supposed to have been
granted by Richard to Sir William Walworth for his
assistance in putting down this rebellion, had been
there long before, and perhaps referred to past services of the citizens in furnishing arms; or more
likely to St. Paul, the City's patron saint, whose
emblem it was. When the Black Prince and his
prisoner, John, King of France, made their public
entry into London after the battle of Poitiers, in
<date value="1356">1356</date>, we read that the London authorities met him
at Southwark, gorgeously apparelled, and conducted
him in state through the City to the Savoy; but the
most remarkable part of the show on that occasion
was, not so much the tapestry hanging from every
window, the showers of roses, or the sanded streets,
but the extraordinary quantity of arms-bows,
arrows, spears, and swords-exhibited by the citizens in token of their warlike proclivities. It was at
this time that Sir John Picard, the mayor, entertained four kings-namely, those of England, France,
Scotland, and Cyprus-at a banquet in the City.</p>

<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>

<quote><foreign lang="LA">ad opus ipsius regis pro gunnis suis.</foreign></quote> Edward
seems to have superintended this and all other
preparations for his expeditions himself; and to
this fact we must attribute in a great measure his
success. There is a curious story of his unexpected
return one day from Ghent, where he had been with
his army. He found to his surprise that the Tower
was unguarded, the constable being <soCalled> out of town,</soCalled>
and the deputy absent, as well as many of the
inferior officers. In great wrath he sent for the
mayor, and charged him, as he valued his head, to
arrest and bring before him that same night nine
persons who had neglected their duty, and whose
names he gave him. They were immediately arrested and given up to the King for punishment-
all but one, Sir John de Molins, who took to flight.
To those who surrendered Edward acted with great
moderation. They were imprisoned for a short
time, and then pardoned; but we may be sure they
never again obtained employment in any situation
of trust. He acted quite differently towards Sir
John de Molins. His flight was attributed to a consciousness of having committed treason, and, by the
King's decree, his goods were confiscated without
delay. A large quantity of treasure which he had
laid up at the Temple in Fleet-street was immediately seized. About the same time the King paid
a sudden visit to St. Alban's Abbey, as he had
reasons for suspecting the complicity of the abbot
in Sir John's disappearance. Edward obliged the





                 <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

frightened monks, who, it seems, had heard nothing
of the occurrences at the Tower, to open all their
secret recesses and places of concealment. The
abbot showed him all without reserve, except one
room, which he declared was fastened up. <q type="spoken"> What
does it contain?</q> asked the King.  <q type="spoken">Treasures
belonging to Sir John de Molins,</q> replied the unconscious abbot.  <q type="spoken">The very thing I want,</q>" said the
King; and sending for a smith, he had the lock
broken, and seized a large treasure.</p>
  <p>A terrible tragedy took place in <date value="1441">1441</date>. The circumstances are singularly illustrative of the manners
and superstitions of the times. Henry VI. had been
from his childhood weak both in mind and body.
He was now nineteen years of age, and, his health
not improving as he grew older, a rumour was
spread abroad among the common people, by which
it was insinuated that some of the King's relations
were anxious to shorten his life, in order that they
might themselves reap the advantage of succeeding
him. By the arts of Cardinal Beaufort suspicion
was directed to the Duke of Gloucester, who was
Henry's uncle, being one of the sons of Henry IV.
He was accused of various treasonable crimes, but the
Cardinal failed to substantiate his charges. He determined, however, to obtain the destruction of the
Duke, with whom he had been long at open feud.
The means he adopted gave him, as a cardinal and
a bishop, the greatest advantage in the contest. He
fixed upon the Duke's wife as the object of persecution.






<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>

She was accused <quote> of certain articles of
negromancie,</quote> by which was meant witchcraft
or sorcery, together with a charge of heresy and
treason.</p>
  <p>It was alleged that, in conjunction with a priest
named Bullingbrook and two other men, together
with a reputed witch named Margery Jordan, she
had caused a waxen figure resembling the King to
be made; that the conspirators intended, by placing
this figure, after certain magical ceremonies, in
front of a large fire, to melt it by degrees; and it
was stated, and fully believed by the great majority
of the people, that, if she had been permitted to
treat the effigy in this manner, the King would have
also wasted away and been consumed gradually.
She was brought up at Guildhall and tried, with
her alleged associates; and full confirmation of her
crime was extorted from Bullingbrook, who, probably in hope of pardon, deposed that the Duchess
had consulted him on certain questions regarding
her own fortunes, and had asked him to discover
<quote>what should befall of her, and to what estate she
should come.</quote> This admission was supposed to
point to her desire of the crown for her husband:
after a short trial, however, she was acquitted of
the treason, but found guilty of consulting with the
sorcerers, and condemned to do public penance and
to suffer a lifelong imprisonment. Stow gives the
following account of the manner in which her
penance was performed:






                <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>

  <quote>On Monday, November 13, she came from
Westminster by water, and landed at the Temple
Bridge, from whence, with a taper of waxe of two
pound in her hande, she went through Fleete-
streete, hoodlesse save a kerchefe, to Paul's, where
she offered her taper at the high altar. On the
Wednesday next she landed at the Swan, in Thames-
street </quote>-the position of which landing-place is still
marked by Swan Wharf, where the river-steamers
land their passengers--<quote> and then went through
Bridge Street, Gracechurch Street, straight to
Leadenhall, and so to Christ Church by Aldegate.
On Friday shee landed at Queene Hithe, and so
went through Cheape to St. Michael's, in Cornhill,
in forme aforesaid: at which time the maior,
sherifes and crafts of London receaved her and
accompanied her.</quote></p>
  <p>On the following day, the 18th, the unfortunate
Bullingbrook was dragged to <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, and, notwithstanding his confession, was hanged and quartered,
having first, on his way, standing on a high scaffold
in St. Paul's Churchyard, abjured <quote>the craft of
negromancie.</quote>  The unhappy woman Jordan was
at the same time burnt in <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName>, whilst the
Duchess was banished to the Isle of Man, and
remained there in perpetual imprisonment until
her death.</p>
  <p>Shortly after these events, Henry married Margaret of Anjou, who siding with the Cardinal against
Gloucester, the Duke's destructionwas finally accomplished.






<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>

In <date value="1447">1447</date> he was arrested at Bury St.
Edmund's, and murdered the following day in
prison. Some accounts, however, relate that his
death was caused by disease, aggravated by the
excitement of his arrest. As if to justify the Duke's
enemies, his servants, to the number of five, were
condemned to death, and really hanged at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>,
care being taken that their ropes should be cut so
as to avert their death, and their pardon was produced at the same moment. It shows the barbarity
of the times, that these unfortunate men, who had
committed no crime, were stripped of all they
possessed, their very clothes being taken from them
by the hangman and his assistants.</p>
  <p>I have already spoken of Crosby House; and in
my account of St. Helen's I shall have occasion to
speak of it again. In it was laid one of the last
scenes in which the expiring race of Plantagenet
took part. Richard, Duke of Gloucester, youngest
brother of Edward IV., resided here in <date value="1483">1483</date>, and
here, a little later, he accomplished the deposition
of his nephew, the young Edward V. Hall, the
Chronicler, from whom Shakespeare has adapted
the story of his "Richard III.," narrates the circumstances very fully. <quote> When the Protector had both
the chyldren in his possession, yea, and that they
were in a sure place, he then began to thirst to se
the ende of his enterprise; and, to avoyde al suspicion, he caused al the lordes whom he knew to be
faithfull to the Kynge to assemble at Baynardes

Castill to commune of the order of the coronacion,
while he and other of his complices and of his
affinitee, at Crosbie's Place, contryved the contrary
and to make the Protector Kyng; of which counsail
they were, adhibite, very few, and they very
secrete.... Little and little all men drew from the
tower, where the Kygne was, and drewe to Crosbie's
Place; so that the Protector had all the resorte,
and the Kynge in maner desolate.</quote>

  <p>Thus Richard gradually matured the plans which
he had formed, and mounted the tottering throne.
It is curious to remark that, even if the family of
Edward IV. had been set aside, Richard would not
have been the next heir, but Edward Earl of Warwick, the son of his brother George, Duke of Clarence.
This unhappy boy spent almost all his life in the
Tower. The accession of Henry VII. brought him
no relief. He was the last male of his house, and
in <date value="1499">1499</date> shared the fate of so many of his family.</p>
  <p>After this time Crosby Hall was inhabited successively by many eminent persons; and it is not
a little curious to find among the number <quote> Sydney's sister, Pembroke's mother,</quote> the patroness of
Ben Jonson, and, through him, possibly of a more
famous person than either-William Shakespeare,

tragedy.</p>

        <p>WHEN George II. died in <date value="1760">1760</date> at his villa
          about three miles west of London, near
          Kensington, England was in the throes
          of a war which had lasted with little
intermission since the King's accession in <date value="1726">1726</date>.
Notwithstanding this, England had reached a pitch
of opulence unknown before. The historians of the
time speak of it very differently from the way we
should now: they say England was rich notwithstanding a National Debt of &#x00A3;100,000,000. If our
National Debt amounted only to a hundred millions
we would not complain. It amounts now-in time
of peace-to upwards of &#x00A3;700,000,000. The conquest of Canada was then the great topic of conversation; and we may note that new streets were
in several places called from the city of Quebec.
Two at least were thus named in different parts of
the little town of Marylebone, which was at that
period being extended in all directions. Its progress westward was stopped by <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, of which I
shall have more to say presently; and there were
few or no houses along the Oxford-road from <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>





<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>

Turnpike, near where the Marble Arch is now, to
Kensington. Between <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> and <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName> the
houses were tolerably plentiful, at least on the
southern side of the way: on the northern side it
was more open.  The Foundling Hospital had a few
very fashionable streets about it, and the district
of Bloomsbury, Russell-square, Bedford-square, and
the rest, answered to our Belgravia and Bayswater.</p>
  <p>On the south side of Hyde Park, <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName> extended as far as it does now, and was full of
builders' yards and plaster works, like Euston-
road at the present day.   On the site of St.
George's Hospital was a turnpike, and just beyond
it, the country house of Lord Lanesborough had just
been pulled down to make way for the new institution. Near it, facing the park, was Buckingham
House, which the young King was about to make
his residence, then commonly called the Queen's
House. There were few or no buildings, except
country houses, further west. Pimlico was a marsh,
Belgravia was market gardens. Chelsea was resorted to as Richmond is now; and from Battersea
to <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName> was almost open country, with widely
separated villages and a few country houses of rich
noblemen.</p>
  <p><placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName> was a little better populated, but the
population was not of a very respectable kind. All
round the Archbishop's palace were streets and
alleys of the worst description. Some of them
possessed privileges of sanctuary, and were resorted





                         <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

to by insolvent persons of all classes, who here
enjoyed a kind of liberty and ventured out on
Sundays only, being exempt from arrest on that
day. Very few houses were to be found in Lambeth
Marsh, and where the busy stations we call Waterloo
now stand there were open fields with an occasional factory, and a fringe of wharves towards the
river. Thus we reach Southwark, at the foot of
London Bridge. In <date value="1770">1770</date> the Borough was very
densely populated, and, like <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName>, with the
lowest class. There was another sanctuary here
called the Mint, but fifty years before its privileges
had been abolished. The debtors' prison, called
the King's Bench, as well as the Marshalsea, were
between <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName> and Southwark. Pirates as well
as debtors were confined in the latter, which stood
close to St. George's Church. We shall have to
return to the subject of prison life a hundred years ago.
  St. George's Church had not been built very long.
St. Saviour's had recently been repaired, but the
old nave was still standing.</p>
  <p>The Borough was still the great place for theatres.
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre had been near the
Bridge foot, and Shakespeare's brother Edmund is
buried in St. Saviour's. These theatres had sadly
degenerated since his time, and in <date value="1770">1770</date> were used
for bull-baiting and such other cruel sports.</p>
  <p>But if we could revisit those old times, I think
the strangest thing in our eyes would have been
the bridge as it existed a hundred years ago.</p>





<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>

  <p>It had been always a serious matter how to cross
the Thames. There was a horse ferry from <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName> to Westminster until the year <date value="1750">1750</date> or thereabouts, when Westminster Bridge was completed-
not the bridge we see now, but a stone bridge
almost on the same site. The Thames there is 300
feet wider than at London Bridge, and the architect deserved great credit for his boldness. Blackfriars Bridge was begun in <date value="1760">1760</date>, and was now
approaching completion. And the only other way
over the water was London Bridge. In <date value="1770">1770</date> it was
a very different structure from what we see now.
A year or two before, it had houses on it-not a
double row as previously, but a few here and there,
and the remains of the chapel of St. Thomas a
Becket in the centre. In <date value="1766">1766</date> the old half-fortified
gateway stood at the southern end, and may still
have deserved its name of the Traitor's Gate, from
the skulls of the Scots rebels grinning on spikes
over the archway. It was like St. John's Gate at
Clerkenwell, or the Gate of St. James's Palace, but
of stone. The bridge itself was built on abutments
and piers of the most primitive kind. It contained
no fewer than nineteen arches, pointed, and of
course very narrow; instead of only five arches, as at
present. For two hundred years a large part of the
water supplied to the City was drawn from the
river by a water-wheel, which moved under one of
the arches. The stream was often very strong, and
Pennant, in <date value="1787">1787</date>, speaks of taking boat from Westminster





                         <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>

along the river, but getting out at Old Swan
Stairs, to avoid the risk of <quote>adding to the many
thousands who had lost their lives in darting down
the rapids at London Bridge.</quote>  He tells us then of
walking to Billingsgate and there re-embarking.
The present bridge was begun in <date value="1825">1825</date>, and the
principal difficulty in the way of the new bridge
was the extraordinary solidity of the old foundations
and piers. They were like rocks in the river bed.</p>
  <p>There is very little change in the outward aspect
of the City from a distance in one hundred years.
St. Paul's had been finished about thirty years
before. There was, of course, no station at Cannon-
street nor any railway bridge, but otherwise the
difference between London five, and London one
hundred, years ago is very slight in outward
appearance. There was hardly so much smoke;
very few tall chimneys; a few more trees, especially
to the left, towards the Temple; the warehouses
were lower, and the church steeples consequently
looked taller, and there were more houses with
gables and perhaps a Gothic window or two. The
approaches to the bridge, however, were very different, consisting of a labyrinth of small streets
where King William-street now stands. And from
the Tower, looking down the river, there were only
one or two docks, and a very small number of ships
-at least to our modern ideas-and of course no
steamers. Where the important St. Katherine's
Dock now stands, just beyond the Tower, was a



<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>

church and a kind of almshouse or college; they
were moved to the Regent's Park in <date value="1827">1827</date>.</p>
  <p>Returning to Southwark, the first thing, perhaps,
that strikes us is how soon the streets end and the
open country succeeds. Newington Causeway was
a real causeway or paved way over some marshy
ground, and Newington Butts was what we should
call a rifle-ground-only for bows and arrows.</p>
  <p>St. George's Fields were still fields in reality,
with only a sprinkling of houses. But all about the
foot of the bridge was a closely-inhabited district,
containing the remains of many fine buildings 'of
older times than these. To the west of St. Saviour's
Church was an old Gothic hall, part of the Bishop
of Winchester's Palace. It was let in small tenements and divided by floors, though the roof was
worthy to be compared with that of Westminster
Hall. Rochester House, another palace of the
same kind, stood where the Borough Market is
now.</p>
  <p>The cloisters of the Conventual Church stood on
the site of Montagu Close. Lord Monteagle was
living there when he got the famous letter about the
Gunpowder Plot.</p>
  <p>The Globe, Shakespeare's Theatre, was on part
of the ground now occupied by Barclay and Perkins's
brewery. It was abandoned at the time of the
Parliament's proclamation against theatrical entertainments, and was never afterwards revived.</p>
  <p>A little way down the river from Southwark was





                         <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

 Rotherhithe, a mere village, generally called Redriff. Here was the Greenland Dock, into which
 ships laden with whale's blubber were brought. It
 was seventy years founded, and was looked upon in
 those days as quite a wonder. The new church was
 just finished at this time. The tower and spire are
 remarkable. Prince Lee Boo was buried here in
 <date value="1784">1784</date>. The number of houses at this time was
 about 1,500, and it was growing rapidly.</p>
   <p>A little way off, across the fields, was Bermondsey.
   It is now a little more than a hundred years since
 Bermondsey Spa was discovered. Tea gardens and
 grounds like Cremorne were established there.
 There were some remains still standing of the
 Abbey and the King's Palace, all which are gone
 now.   In those days the parish contained only
 about 2,500 houses.</p>
   <p>Next to Rotherhithe, and between it and Deptford, came Camberwell. In the year <date value="1787">1787</date>, there
 were 3,762 inhabitants. The whole parish consisted of gentlemen's country seats, some of them
 very handsome; there was only one church, the
 parish church: how many are there now? Peckham was in the parish, and contained about 400
 houses; and there were 130 in Hatcham.</p>
   <p>We have thus obtained some idea of the size and
appearance of South London a hundred years ago.
North London was just as different. Hampstead
and Highgate were a long way off, and were occupied by the villas of various noblemen and gentlemen.



<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>

But we need not pause to notice them;
they were, in those days, as little accounted a part
of London as we should account Richmond or
Harrow. The western extremity of the town was
at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>. And the mention of <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> suggests
so many curious memories that I had better stop
to speak, first of the state of London prisons as
they were then, and next of the awful scenes which
made <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> itself so disgracefully famous.</p>
  <p>It is hard to understand how persons who were
constantly in the habit of using such phrases as
<quote> the mildness and humanity of English law,</quote> a
very common expression among writers of the
eighteenth century, could have allowed their gaols
to be so mismanaged as they were. A change
began when, in <date value="1773">1773</date>, John Howard happened to be
sheriff of Bedfordshire. His attention was called
to the fact that, after trial and acquittal, prisoners
were seldom discharged. He then found the reason
to be that the gaolers had no salary but the fees
to be paid by each prisoner, and that these were
seldom forthcoming. He endeavoured to obtain a
mitigation of this evil, and travelled throughout
England to prosecute inquiries on the subject. In
London, in Howard's time, debtors and felons were
almost always confined together: men and women
in many cases: men, women, and children in some.
A woman was hanged at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> with a baby at
the breast, for stealing a piece of lace worth two
shillings. There were several cases of children





                        <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>

dying of cold in prison. There were no prison
surgeons in London except at Newgate, and three
other of the most recently erected prisons. The
gaolers always rented the prisons, and made what
they could out of the prisoners. At the entrance of
every gaol was a tap or publichouse, kept by the
gaoler himself in most cases, but sometimes by one
of the prisoners. At the Marshalsea, in Southwark,
the tap was kept by a prisoner-for-debt from the
King's Bench, which was so near that he could
attend to his business without going beyond the
bounds or rules. It was common for persons who
were friends of the prisoners to come in and drink
with them. In one place there was a skittle alley,
exclusively used by outsiders, who thus prevented the prisoners from taking exercise in their
yard  Gaol fever raged so terribly in almost all the
London and country prisons that, to give you one
example of each, in London in <date value="1750">1750</date>, two judges,
the Lord Mayor, several aldermen, the under
sheriff, and many lawyers who had attended the
March sessions at the Old Bailey, together with
most of the Middlesex jury, and a considerable

at the Taunton assizes, Lent, <date value="1730">1730</date>, the Lord Chief
Baron, Serjeant Sheppard, Mr. Pigot the High
Sheriff, and more than 200 other people, died of the
Game epidemic.   Prisons do not appear to have
been inspected in any way: nay, they were often
private property-the Gate House, the chief prison

for Westminster, belonged to the Dean and Chapter, and the town gaol of Salisbury to the
Bishop-and this gave rise to many abuses: the
gaoler being appointed not for his humanity or any
other quality, except his power of wringing a good
rent out of his wretched charge. In most places
there was no provision made for feeding the prisoners, except perhaps a few pence worth of bread
in the day.  In others, charitable persons gave
small sums of money to be applied in this way, and
others sent meat and provisions of various kinds.
Legacies, too, were sometimes left. They were,
however, administered-as legacies were usually
administered in those days. No bedding, or straw
even for bedding, was allowed in any prison except
out of the charity of private individuals. Water
had often to be fetched long distances by prisoners
in irons. Even air was often denied through the
operation of the window tax, which had to be paid
by the gaoler. Another shocking abuse arose from
the distances which prisoners had often to go for
trial. There were no prison vans, and you might
often meet along a country road a gang of unhappy
creatures-men, women, and children-dragging
heavy irons to prevent escape, and walking-or
rather creeping-perhaps fourteen or fifteen miles
to the assize town. When they arrived there, a room
or two would be hired for their occupation till after
the sessions, probably in some publichouse, and
then they would all-men, women, and children, as

I have said-be shut up together, tired, filthy,
starving: so that it is no wonder we hear that their
shrieks and cries disturbed the whole neighbourhood; no wonder that Mr. Howard was informed at
Aylesbury of two men whose toes had mortified after
their journey from Hertford; and that another man
told him that he and fifteen others were confined in
a very small room at Reigate, awaiting their trial at
quarter sessions, and were almost suffocated. The
keeper confirmed the statement. Yet this man was
only arrested in order to oblige him to maintain a
child, and being unable at a strange place like
Reigate to find securities, was sent back to the
County Bridewell, in St. George's Fields, for an
indefinite term.  This same Bridewell is a fair
sample of all. There was no glass in the windows,
only iron bars. There were no fires, nor was any
firing allowed. The sick prisoners lay on the floor:
no bedding; no straw. Allowance, 1(1/2)d. worth of
bread per diem. Convicts and all other prisoners
together. No infirmary. And yet in this hell upon
earth many unfortunates who had committed no
crime, and had yet to be tried, were confined.
Before trial they had, perhaps, to wait six months
or more, and then to undergo the misery of a
journey such as I have described to Reigate or
Kingston.</p>
  <p>When the trial came on, it was not wonderful to
find, neither prisoners nor judges were very careful
as to the punishment.  Almost all crimes were





<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>

punished alike: a journey in a cart up <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>
hill to <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> for prisoners in London itself, and
the gallows when they got there. The history of
<placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> has yet to be written. It is not a hundred
years since the monthly horrors ceased: we can
scarcely yet speak of them calmly. But already
the exact spot on which the gallows stood is in
question, and a hundred years hence it may be
difficult to identify any part of the site.</p>
  <p>The executions at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> were discontinued in
the year <date value="1783">1783</date>. The gallows had been removed
further and further westward from the year <date value="1415">1415</date>,
when they stood in St. Giles's Fields-probably
very near the spot at which Bloomsbury-street
crosses Oxford-street; in <date value="1449">1449</date>, or earlier, they had
gone as far as Stratford-place, where there was a
conduit and other civic institutions-including, of
course, a banqueting-house. They reached <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>
early in the sixteenth century, and remained there
for nearly 300 years.</p>
   <p>The Eye Bourne, or Burn, rises at Kilburn or

at least, this is its probable direction; but
it is not easy to trace now, as what little of it still
flows, flows underground.  Another stream rises
at St. Mary-le-bourne, or Marylebone, and gives its
name probably to Conduit-street and Brook-street;
a third flowed through <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, and a fourth was
the Fleet. The <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> and the Marybourne are
sometimes, as by Dean Stanley, considered the same
stream.  This is questionable; but they probably
met in the neighbourhood of Berkeley-square, perhaps on the site of Lansdowne House, and flowed
together to the Abbey. It is impossible now to make
very sure of any of these surmises. We only know
that the gallows were erected at a place to the west of

Marylebone-lane-probably, at first, almost adjoining it; and as houses came nearer the open space
the fatal tree was moved further, till it took up its
most permanent abode at a place where it was
almost certain to remain open on two sides at
least. This was at the angle formed by the junction of the Edgware and Oxford roads, faced by the
Park on one side and by open country on two
others. <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> Turnpike stood where we now see
the Marble Arch, that is, a little to the left of Parklane (formerly Tyburn-lane); and a little way up
the Edgware-road on the right-hand side was an
inn, where, a hundred years ago and upwards, the
sheriffs and other officials dined after the executions. A stage, much resembling the grand
stand at a race, was erected in front of this house
for the spectators. During the declining years of
the show, the gallows were removed after each
performance, and were deposited in the inn-yard
till they were next required. After <date value="1783">1783</date> they remained there permanently, and eventually degenerated into horse-blocks and watering-troughs. A
place of execution for soldiers was just within
the Park boundary, which consisted of a low
wall.</p>
  <p>In Hogarth's print of the Execution of the Idle
Apprentice, a representation of <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> in <date value="1747">1747</date> will
be found, and may be considered tolerably accurate.
A long avenue of walnut-trees commenced just
within the Park-wall. This is on the left of the





                        <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>

picture. The wall itself is surmounted by a row of
spectators.  Behind, on the right, stand the gallows; they are triangular, supported by three
stout beams or legs, and must have been set up
almost, if not exactly, on the site of the easternmost
house of Connaught-place. In <date value="1860">1860</date> a considerable
number of human bones were found in digging a
sewer under the pathway along the garden-wall of
this house. Possibly these were part of the remains
of <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Cromwell</persName>, Ireton, and Bradshaw, who were
buried under the gallows in <date value="1661">1661</date>. In <date value="1811">1811</date>, or thereabouts, another large find of bones had been made
near the same spot: a pit was dug in the mews, and
there they were buried again. It would not surely
be difficult to obtain a list of all the criminals who
were buried under the gallows at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>.</p>
  <p>It has often been asserted that the gallows stood
as far to the west as Connaught-square, and a
house there, No. 49, is said to stand on the exact
site. This is of course quite possible, because,
as we have seen, they were by no means fixtures,
but were several times removed-generally at each
change of place going a little further towards the
west. Their last migration, however, was in an
easterly direction, for just before their final remove
they were set up across the Edgware-road for each
execution, where they must have formed a highly
interesting, if unpleasant, object to pass on the
return from a country drive.</p>
  <p>Views of <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, as it was a hundred years ago,






<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>

are almost unknown. Hogarth gives one in his
Execution of the Idle Apprentice, to which we have
already adverted.  But except incidentally, so to
speak, there is no extant representation. The engraving on p. 105 is taken from a china plate in my
own possession, and gives a rough but, for want of
better, an interesting sketch of the Turnpike-gate.
It is, perhaps, seventy years old; on the right, as
in Hogarth's print, we see the Park wall. Behind,
but surely magnified, are Hampstead and Highgate.
A curious iron lamp-post is beyond the gate, and
marks the corner of what we still recognise as the
Edgware-road. When turnpikes were abolished an
iron tablet was set up against the Park railings to
indicate its site. How many of the thousands who
daily turn out of Oxford-street into Edgware-road
reflect that they perchance pass over the very spot
where rest the remains of one of the greatest men
England has produced ? How many recall the
words-
             <quote><foreign lang="LA">Siste, viator, heroem calcas ?</foreign></quote>"
Yet the fact is beyond a doubt that here-that is to
say, at the corner of Edgware-road, probably just
where the easternmost house of Connaught-place
now stands-the body of <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Oliver Cromwell</persName>, together
with the bodies of Ireton and Bradshaw, were buried
<soCalled>under the gallows.</soCalled>  When Connaught-place was
built, a cart-load or more of bones were discovered
and removed to the adjacent mews, where they
were again buried in a pit.</p>

  <p>Surely, never were Hamlet's words better illustrated. <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Cromwell</persName>'s remains having been exhumed
from their first resting-place in Henry the Seventh's

the <soCalled>Blue Boar,</soCalled> in the stable of which <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Cromwell</persName>
is said to have discovered the letter which determined the question of the King's execution. Both
inns have now disappeared. On the site of the
<soCalled>Blue Boar </soCalled> is the <soCalled> Inns of Court</soCalled> Hotel; and
Red Lion-square marks the situation of the other.
What is now the square was then the paddock;
and it has often been said that during the night of
the <date value="1661-01-29">29th of January, 1661</date>, on which the remains
of the great usurper rested there, some of his old
soldiers contrived to steal them and to bury them
secretly in the paddock. Another story runs differently, and assigns Northborough, in Huntingdonshire, as the final resting-place of the dead Protector. Another, again, takes him down to the field
of Naseby, and deposits him among the slain of his
great victory. But all these traditions and rumours
-for there were many of them-only show how
great was the reluctance with which the public
mind accepted the fact of the <date value="1661-01-30">30th of January</date>, and
how abhorrent to all the feelings of the nation was






<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>

the scene which then took place. The three
corpses, in their leaden covering, were dragged
along the Oxford-road to <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, and hung by
the necks upon the triangular gallows, which then
stood there. At sunset they were taken down, the
heads were hacked off, and the headless bodies
thrown into a hole under the gallows, among the
bones of the malefactors who had already been
buried there. The heads were carried to Westminster Hall, and grinned from the gable for many
years. Two or three <soCalled>heads of <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Oliver Cromwell</persName></soCalled>
are now in private possession; one (but which?)
is probably the real skull-Ireton's and Bradshaw's
may supply the others.</p>
  <p>Were the bones exhumed at the building of Connaught-place those of <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Cromwell</persName> ? It is very likely
they were. Very few persons were buried under the
gallows, and it is not impossible that the greater
part of the <soCalled>cart-load</soCalled> was composed of the
skeletons of the three great men of the Rebellion.
A careful examination of them might have revealed
their identity. The leaden coverings would not
perish entirely in two hundred years, and perhaps
it is not yet too late to make the attempt. In these
monument-building days we should have a monument to <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Cromwell</persName>; and if his bones could be
discovered, there seems little doubt that a head
might be fitted to them and the remains interred
with the honour he surely deserves of our nation.</p>
  <p>Another memory, connecting these sad times and





                     <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>

their history with <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>, is that of the execution
here of two of the regicides, in <date value="1660-10">October, 1660</date>.
Eight of them had already been barbarously hanged,
drawn, and quartered at <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>; but Hacker
and Axtel-ominous names-were reserved for
<placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName>. They had both been colonels under <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Cromwell</persName>. Axtel was the officer who, at the King's trial,
caused the soldiers to cry out for his execution.
Hacker was in charge of the scaffold, and led the
King out to his death. About nine in the morning
of Friday, the 19th of October, they were drawn
from Newgate on a hurdle. Axtel was hanged and
quartered; but Hacker, although undoubtedly the
more guilty of the two, was simply hanged, and his
body delivered entire to his friends. The mangled
limbs of his companion were exposed in various
parts of the City.</p>
  <p>A century ago the number of persons hanged in
London in the course of a year was usually 29 or 30.
In <date value="1771">1771</date> it was 37, of which three only were condemned for murder. In <date value="1774">1774</date> the number was 46,
two only for murder. In <date value="1773">1773</date>, a woman was burnt
for murder; in <date value="1778">1778</date>, one was burnt for coining.
Nay, so lately as <date value="1789">1789</date> a woman named Christian
Bowman was strangled at the stake and publicly
burnt before Newgate for coining. In <date value="1769">1769</date>, a woman
called Lott, who had murdered her husband, had
been executed in the same way. In <date value="1770">1770</date>, at one
sessions at the Old Bailey, 30 persons were condemned to death; 17 of them were respited, and 13





<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>

hanged at <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> a fortnight later. They were
chiefly young boys, the eldest of the party being only
22. It took five carts to convey them from Newgate.</p>
  <p>I have, perhaps, delayed too long over these
memories, which, strictly speaking, do not belong to
an account of London one century ago; but as
<placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> was then, literally, in full swing, and as it was
so soon afterwards abolished as a place of execution,
this seems the best opportunity for speaking of them.</p>
  <p>As I draw these notes to a close, it may be worth
while to inquire a little into the historical events of
a hundred years ago in London.</p>
  <p><date value="1768-05-10">1768, May 10</date>. There was a riot in St. George's
Fields. The troops fired, and killed many persons.
The epitaph on one of the slain says <quote>he was inhumanly murdered by Scottish detachments from
the army.</quote></p>
  <p><date value="1769-09-30">1769, September 30</date>. There was a similar riot in
Spitalfields to resist the introduction of power looms.
Two of the mob and a soldier were killed. Two men
were afterwards hanged at Bethnal Green for the
soldier's death. They protested their innocence to
the last, and I fear we must believe their statements.
It is not very surprising they were condemned, if we
remember that persons tried for felony were, by an
excess of barbarity, denied counsel, although in a
case like this, in which party spirit ran very high,
there would be a great array of legal talent on the
side of the prosecution.</p>
  <p>In newspapers of this date we have news from





                     <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>

America two months old, and this calls to our minds
the difficulties of locomotion.  The roads about
London were very bad, and were, moreover, infested
with highwaymen. On the <date value="1770-04-14">14th April, 1770</date>, two
gentlemen, coming home across Blackheath, were
attacked in their carriage by a robber; one of the
gentlemen fired a pistol and shot him dead. They
left the body where it lay, and drove on. Just as
they came to New Cross, they were attacked again
by a man on horseback; and again the same
gentleman fired and hit the highwayman, who fell
from his horse, but managed to hide in the ditch
and to escape among the thickets on the Old Kent-
road. In the following month, a young man was
murdered by thieves as he returned on foot through
one of the lanes near Sadler's Wells. On the <date value="1770-05-27">27th of
May</date>, two men, sailors I think, were shot by footpads,
near Stepney. Nay, to such a pitch had brigandage
come, that we hear of a plot being laid to rob the
Queen on her way to St. James's from supping in
the City. The design was to have been carried out
in St. Paul's Churchyard; but, in the words of the
historian, <quote> Those execrable villains being employed
in robbing Sir Gilbert Heathcote, an Alderman of
London, on his return in his chariot from the House
of Commons, her Majesty luckily passed them in
her coach without being attacked.</quote> Most people
travelled on horseback, but noblemen and those who
were wealthy, by using four horses, or even sometimes six, were able to get about in carriages at



<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>

great expense. Coaches carrying the mails lumbered along very slowly, and were constantly the
prey of highwaymen. Thus, just one hundred years
ago, the Chester mail was robbed in the City-
road. The Leeds coach was stopped at Holloway
in <date value="1769-03">March, 1769</date>, by a single highwayman, who was
wounded, but got off. In the dark, a passenger
was tied neck and heels and thrown into the basket
before he was recognised. In town, a hackney
coach might be had at great expense, but there
were no cabs, and it was really a serious matter to
take even a journey from Marylebone to the Kent-
road. Coming from the village of Marylebone, one
would probably have avoided the Park for fear of robbers, and Park Lane for the same reason, as well as
the badness of the road. We should have gone along
Oxford-road to <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, taking care, as we passed
the labyrinth of streets on the site of which Regent-
street now stands, to carry our swords well in hand
and to cock our pistols.  Perhaps, however, a
clergyman would not have worn a sword, and would
have trusted more to his gown and bands to protect
him than to his pistols. But the probability is I
should not have worn the usual costume of a clergyman (the long black cassock, which still survives in
Bishops' aprons, and the gown and bands, to say
nothing of the shovel three-cornered hat and the
full-bottomed wig); it would be too inconvenient to
take so long a journey in. When I got as far as
<placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, I should try to keep company with any





                     <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>

respectable-looking person I could find going the
same way till we were well past St. Giles's. I would
then turn down Chancery-lane, and at Temple
Stairs would try and make a bargain with a waterman to row me down the river to London Bridge.
I should cross the bridge on foot, and then, if
possible, obtain a hackney coach in Southwark to
drive me along the Kent-road towards Deptford.
This would cost &#x00A3;1 1s. I might, perhaps, get a
seat on one of the Greenwich coaches, which are
beginning to ply, morning and evening, as far as
Southwark. I should not think of returning to the
distant Marylebone the same night, unless I was
willing to run the risk of being out all night, and of
being, perhaps, robbed and murdered on the way
home. The beauty of the severe penal laws was,
that if a man robbed you he might as well shoot you,
because dead men tell no tales, and if he were
caught and convicted, he would be hanged just as
surely for robbing you as for killing you. It is very
odd that our legislators were so long perceiving the
effect of their efforts for suppressing crime by
severity. I should, as I passed through Southwark,
have admired the light of the numberless oil lamps
which had been lately placed in St. George's
Fields to mark the way, but which only served to
make the darkness of the Kent-road more dismal.
I should also, in passing through the streets of
London, have congratulated myself and the London
public on the brilliant illumination made by the oil




<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>

lamps at almost every corner, and, in some streets,
even along both sides of the way at long intervals.
Of course, I should not admire this feeble light if I
had ever seen gas; and, bad as London gas is, it is
a thousand times better than anything used before.
In houses the chief light was tallow candles; wax
was too expensive for common use, and composites
were not yet invented. Even to light your dip you
had to go through an elaborate process with a flint
and steel and some dry tinder in your tinder box.</p>

citizen, a member of Parliament, a faithful public
servant, a President of the Royal Society, a founder
of a great University library, and-to mention last
the one thing for which his name will be longest
cherished-the writer of a ten years' Diary (<dateRange from="1659" to="1669">1659-1669</dateRange>), in one of the most eventful periods of our
history.</p>
  <p>In <date value="1838">1838</date>, two well-known antiquaries published a
book about London Churches. They described St.
Olave's at full length.  They mentioned all the
monuments except one. They enumerated the great
men connected with the parish, and quoted Defoe's
fictitious account of the Great Plague. Yet they
omitted all mention of the most remarkable man
buried in the church. They gave no account of his
wife's monument, one of the largest the church contains. They said nothing of his " Journal of the
Plague," although it is by far the best extant. A
few years before Messrs. Godwin and Britton brought
out their book, Mr. Smith had deciphered and Lord
Braybrook had edited the now famous " Diary." Sir
Walter Scott had reviewed it in the Quarterly, and
Lord Jeffrey in the Edinburgh. But a six-guinea
book, especially so long ago as <date value="1828">1828</date>, was not likely
to be very widely known, and people had little more
than a vague idea of <persName key="Pepys, Samuel">Pepys</persName>' merits until a couple of
popular editions, the first in <date value="1848">1848</date>, began to make
him  better appreciated, and about ten years ago
everybody who had read anything had read his
Diary. But even now, it is new to many people to




<pb id="p.121" n="121"/>

hear that he is buried in the City; and few, even of
those who agree in Coleridge's note in his own copy,
<quote>most valuable on many various and most important
accounts,</quote> remember how much he did for learning
in his life, and, after death, by his bequests. His
library, which was given to Magdalen College, Cambridge, numbers, among other valuable books, two
volumes of London topographical views and maps,
which he had collected. He was President of the
Royal Society, then in its youth; and showed in
many ways the practical and benevolent turn of his
mind.</p>
  <p>For us he is the writer of the Diary. We can
hardly think of him without a smile. But when we
visit his wife's tomb, look at the bust with which it
is surmounted, and read the eulogistic Latin epitaph
which was indited by her widowed Samuel; when
we look at the monument below, and think that it
occupied the same place when <persName key="Pepys, Samuel">Pepys</persName> worshipped
here, that he must have often read the quaint
inscription, and may possibly have determined to
mould his own life on the model of the two worthy
aldermen there commemorated; when, in short, we
stand in St. Olave's, Hart-street, the Diary over
which we have so often laughed, and which seems
to belong to a period too remote to have much reality
for us, seems now to become a living thing, and its
author something more to us than a name.
This is one of the few churches that survived the
Great Fire, and it possesses many other claims on




<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>
our consideration. Here, perhaps, for the first time
in parochial history the celebrated experiment of
the Duke of St. Albans was tried. In <date value="1672">1672</date>, Sir
Andrew Riccard left the advowson to the inhabitants, and with them it has ever since remained.
The register books date from <date value="1563">1563</date>, and the curious
visitor may still see, under <date value="1665-07-24">July 24, 1665</date>, the name
of Mary Ramsay, with the dreadful " P " annexed,
for she was the person who brought the plague into
the City, and who, before the year was out, was followed to the tomb by a hundred thousand victims.
The organ is said to be one of the efforts of the
famous artist Bernard Schmidt, better known as
Father Smith, and it is worthy of his fame. The
quaint monuments which fill every corner, the
venerable arches of the aisles, the beadle with his
silver mace, the arms of City companies on the ironwork, the vestry-room with an angel looking down
from the roof, the various patterns of the windows,
and not least, the quiet, country-like service, renders
this one of the most attractive among the minor City
churches, quite apart from its connection with
<persName key="Pepys, Samuel">Samuel Pepys</persName>. Yet, let us endeavour as we will to
recall wandering thoughts, it is impossible not to
remember that in the pulpit here<note place="foot" n="1">But not in the present pulpit, which came from a neighbouring church.

 <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>

buried Mrs. Pepys, so soon after her husband's
return from his foreign tour, as her epitaph observes;
and here in <date value="1689">1689</date>,Dr. Mills was buried himself. Then,
after having survived the last entry in his Diary for
more than thirty years, the diarist was borne hither
from the house at Clapham, where he had died at <quote>about three-quarters past three on Wednesday
morning,</quote> May 26, <date value="1703">1703</date>, and was laid under the
pavement of the chancel. A hundred and twenty
mourning rings were distributed at the funeral,
which was performed by Dr. Hickes, the Nonjuring
ex-Dean of Worcester, who wrote of him: <quote>I doubt
not but he is now a very blessed spirit, according to
his motto, <foreign lang="LA">mens cujusque is est quisque</foreign></quote> (as the mind,
so the man).</p>
  <p>The register spells his name Peyps. Immediately
below the bust of Mrs. Pepys is a very good example
of the early seventeenth-century monument and
epitaph. It commemorates two brothers, aldermen,
named Bayning, Paul and Andrew, who died respectively in <date value="1616">1616</date> and <date value="1610">1610</date>:-

it does not redound to the credit of the University

profit from his Diary, that no monument marks the
place of his burial, and that even the memorial
which alone preserves his name in the church is
darkened by ages of London smoke, and made
illegible by the damps of two hundred winters. The
church has been well and conservatively restored.

  <p>THE City is very pleasant on Sunday
          morning.  In all its aspects it differs
  from the same place during the week.
          It is empty, except of foot-passengers:
it is comparatively clean, even in wet weather; it
is free from smoke; the ringing of the church bells
drowns all other sounds. The visitor who keeps his
eyes open is surprised at the long views he obtains
through streets which he is accustomed to see
crowded with vehicles and thick with dust or fog.
The day of rest is a real Sabbath in the City. You
miss the hurrying throng and the anxious faces.
Great warehouses, with their archways and porticoes, are deserted; the ordinary signs of life
are wanting-no children play along the gutters
or sit on the doorsteps, as in other parts of the
Metropolis; no doors are open, no carriages are
passing; the people walk in the roadway, and everybody seems to be going to church. Such an impression is of course much modified by a little experience of Sunday in London; after a time we find
that all the people do not go to a place of worship;





<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>

that some of the churches are almost empty, others
not half full; and that as the afternoon wanes many
sights are to be seen, many sounds to be heard,
sadly at variance with the promise of the morning.</p>
  <p>A pilgrimage from the western districts of the
metropolis is very different now from what it was
when the church we are about to visit was in its
glory. Four centuries ago St. Helen's, Bishopsgate,
was one of the wealthiest of the religious houses
with which London so much abounded. The Prioress owned land in several quarters of the City:
Crosby-place was rented from her in the reign of
Edward IV.; she let a house in Lombard-street to
Queen Isabella. At the dissolution her income was
equal to ten thousand a year in modern reckoning.
Yet this was only one of many similar institutions;
the City and suburbs on all sides were full of them;
but within the walls they were most frequent. The
City itself was then a place of habitation, and though
the religious orders considered it unnecessary to seek
the protection of fortifications, and were to be found
in <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName> and Fleet-street as well as at Walbrook and Newgate, with the laity it was not so.
Almost all the Londoners lived within the walls.
The merchant princes dwelt where they laboured.
Cheapside, where now.on Sunday morning the long
processions of charity children in quaint antiquated
costume seem to represent, at once, the coming
race, and that long past, was then as resonant as
Drury-lane is now. The churches, in which the






                        <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>

beadle and the parish pensioners are often the only
worshippers, had then their full complement of
lords and ladies, knights, aldermen, soldiers, merchants, tradesmen, and poor; where we now pass
on our way through crowded streets, teeming with
life, old and young, until we reach what is the comparative quiet of the City itself, then we should
have journeyed through pleasant villages, surrounded by gardens; and in coming perhaps from
the far brook side at St. Mary-le-bourne, should
have passed successively through St. Giles in the
Fields, with its tall Gothic church, the bare common
in front of Lincoln's Inn, the cluster of high-peaked
roofs and vine-clad gables about the entrance of the
City precincts at Holborn Bars, and descending the
hill, between Ely House, with its rich gardens, and
the suburban church of St. Andrew, on the right
bank of the Fleet, should have enjoyed a view of
castles, palaces, monasteries, towers, churches,
and spires, such as can now be called up only
by the liveliest imagination, assisted by an
occasional dip into one of Pugin's romances on
copper.</p>
  <p>But though the view is now nothing in one sense
to what it was, it is very imposing and very beautiful still. The Viaduct and the railways, the vast
markets, the tall warehouses, have a double interest,
which mere modern buildings, without the associations which cling so close about such a situation,
never excite.  But endeavouring as we pass to





<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>

recall the older glories, we go, by the Grey Friars
Monastery, its low comfortless buildings in strange
contrast to the vast and magnificent church, where
so many royal and noble persons lie buried; by the
sanctuary and collegiate church at St. Martin's-leGrand; by the Austin Friars gate, and so through
Walbrook and a labyrinth of passages to the
fashionable quarter which lay just within the
Bishop's-gate; and then passing through an archway on the right, a little beyond the chief entrance
to Crosby-place, find ourselves in what was once an
extensive <soCalled>pleasaunce,</soCalled> laid out with all the art of
medieval gardening, and bounded on the north by
the buildings then lately erected by Sir John, on the
south by the Priory of St. Helen, and opposite the
entrance by a fine church, which, in part at least,
remains to tell us of the place as it once was. The
little avenue leading to the west door, the double
aisles, the chapels, the tombs, and what is better
than all, a congregation rare in the city, seem to
transport us in a moment miles away into the
country, where the busy, heartless town has not yet
corrupted the old customs, or destroyed the antiquated buildings.</p>
  <p>This is Great St. Helen's. On the right a gable
and oriel of Crosby-place remain to serve as a pattern by which all may be restored in our mind's
eyes. On the left we have nothing but the back of
a row of houses which occupy the site of the nuns'
dwellings. These slope across the vacant space, so

      <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>


   <figure id="Fig.013" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.023.DO01.00013"><head>CRYPT OF ST. HELEN'S SEVENTY YEARS AGO.</head></figure>
as to come into collision with the church at the
farther end; and there, where priory and chapel
met, a crypt was still to be seen seventy years ago.
Within the church, at that point, doorways still indicate the situation of the dormitories and of the
refectory. The double nave and a chapel on the
south are all that now represent the magnificent
conventual church. The <soCalled> Nuns' Aisle </soCalled> equals the
other aisle in size, and both now constitute the
parish church. But before the sixteenth century,
one-half only admitted the ordinary worshippers,
while a high screen divided the congregation from
the sisters. If we enter, like the parishioners, by a



<pb id="p.130" n="130"/>

south porch, which has now little of its original
character, but is interesting as an example of
architectural vicissitude, we are at once struck by
the peculiarities of the building. A clear space
upwards of one hundred feet in length is occupied
by the low seats of the congregation, and at the
eastern end by the choir stalls, leading up to a
railed platform, which serves as a chancel: a fine
window some thirty feet in height, filled with glass,
of which we need only say it is worthy of its situation, bounds the view in this direction.</p>
  <p>The north, or nuns' aisle, is two or three steps
higher, and differs much in arrangement.  Here
are no pews, a few chairs only being required
for the overflowings of a well-attended church;
the floor is occupied by a series of tombs and
monuments, of various ages and styles; and the
wall, facing the noble arches of the nave, is a
rare museum of archeological specimens, tablets,
doorways, niches, and squints.  I have already
said that the domestic buildings of the priory stood
beyond this wall. At the western extremity there
is a charming little lancet window, filled with an
admirable figure in modern glass; a little farther
are two Perpendicular windows, with some remains
of sixteenth-century glass. Eastward from these,
the buildings of the priory abutted; and the wall
is pierced by a series of hagioscopes, at different
levels, according as the chamber, to which they
admitted views of the holy table, was in an upper






                          <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>

or lower story. The largest opening is of a kind
unique in England, but Burgos in Spain and St.
Patrice at Rouen supply examples of a similar
arrangement of window, tomb, reliquary, and hagioscope. The screen which divided the nuns' aisle
from the church was removed at the Reformation; it can never have been a very formidable
barrier, and except at high festivals, the sisters
probably worshipped without leaving their own
precincts.</p>
  <p>We cannot help conjecturing what curious
looks must often have wandered from the altar
to scan the faces of the congregation, when
some great prince or noble, attended by knights
and squires, came to the church from a neighbouring palace.  Here may have knelt in turn
the conqueror of Agincourt, the   King-maker,
the half-imbecile Henry, the fierce and handsome Edward; and here, a little later perhaps,
came the usurper Richard, from his house adjoining, and the delicate heiress of Warwick, his wife,
to beseech St. Edmund and St. Helen for the healing of their dying boy. To the same church, in
after years, when the nuns had disappeared and
the saints were forgotten, came, living or dead, many
whose names are still remembered. Did not Shakespeare live in Bishopsgate-street ? Did not Sidney's
sister, Pembroke's mother, live in Crosby-place ?
Sir John Crosby, and his wife, have their tomb on
the south side of the chancel. Their effigies are





<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>

unusually fine, and almost unmutilated. On the
north a still greater man, Sir Thomas Gresham,
lies between the magnificent cenotaph of Sir William
Pickering and the window of the priory. A window
also commemorates the founder of the Exchange,
while of Sir William Pickering we are told that
<quote> for learning, arts, and warfare, he was the pattern
of his age.</quote></p>
  <p>Nor are the mural tablets less interesting.
One, all glowing with colour and gold, is half-
hidden  by the Pickering monument; another,
over the prioress' window, shows the camp at Tilbury, and the figure of Captain Martin Bond, with
his orderlies and his war-horse; close above it
again is the epitaph of his father, <quote> The rival of
Jason,</quote>
    <quote rend="blockquote"><foreign lang="LA">Flos mercatorum, quos terra Britanna creavit,
    <lb/>Ecce sub hoc tumulo Gulielmus Bondus humatur.</foreign></quote><note place="foot" n="1">The flower of merchants who upon the British soil have
    bloomed,
  <lb/>Behold beneath this monument lies William Bond entombed.</note>
Nearly opposite this tablet reposes Sir John Spencer, and adjoining it is the monument of Alderman
Robinson, <quote>the glasse of whose life held seventy
yeeres and then ranne out;</quote> but perhaps the
strangest of all these quaint inscriptions is in the
south chapel, behind the organ. Here the visitor
will find almost as much to interest him as in the
nuns' aisle. On the east, a beautifully moulded





        <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>

arch, its supports covered with the remains of
colour and gilding, marks the entrance to what was
the <soCalled>Chapel of the Holy Spirit.</soCalled> A vestry-room
now fills the space, but will be condemned when
funds permit. In the south-west corner is a fine,
but late brass of a lady in a mantle embroidered
with rampant lions. The centre of the chapel is
occupied by a large tomb of black marble, bearing
on its surface a white carving inlaid to represent a
parchment deed, with signature, and seal, and
clause of attestation. On it, in text-hand, we read
that Sir Julius Caesar, otherwise Dalmare, Master
of the Rolls to King James, binds himself, when
called upon, to pay the debt of nature.</p>
  <p>But St. Helen's has well been called the Westminster Abbey of the City. Within reasonable
limits it would be impossible to describe even half
the objects of interest with which it abounds. We
have only alluded to the best assembly of brasses
in London, to the ancient glass which still lingers
here and there, to the Elizabethan oak carvings
which abound.   We have not mentioned the
panelled Stuart pulpit; the carefully restored pave
ment, <quote>semee of spread eagles;</quote> the strange mortuary-chamber of Bancroft's degenerate son; the
dole of loaves, spread on a white cloth upon the
tomb of an unknown benefactor, as if to remind us
by its pleasant odour, fresh from the baker's oven,
of the glorious actions of the just, as set forth in
Sherley's poem; the hearty service, the surpliced






<pb id="p.134" n="134"/>

choir, the orderly ritual. We return to the outer
world again with a sigh. No sound from the vortex
around it seems ever to penetrate to Great St.
Helen's; it rests in the calm centre of the whirl.
The citizen who is tired of the turmoil and bustle
without, may here find a moment's peace, and be
reminded of the quiet simplicity and the hallowing
associations he is accustomed to seek only in some
remote country village.</p>
  <p>And so we return home, unexpectedly refreshed
by a Sunday morning in the City.</p>

         PEOPLE pass along the crowded and busy
         Strand, some of them for years, without
         any acquaintance with the quiet little
         church, surrounded by green grass and
trees, which hides itself behind the rows of dingy






<pb id="p.136" n="136"/>

houses. When the mob under Wat Tyler broke into
the great and rich palace of John of Gaunt, they
burnt the greater part of the buildings, if not the
whole. They may have spared the chapel. But if
they did, it has not been recorded; and but for the
fact that during the hundred and twenty years in
which the site lay desolate some burials took place
here, we should have nothing to go upon in concluding that any part of the chapel, in which very probably Wycliffe may have ministered, still remained.
When Henry VIII., in obedience to the dying commands of his father, rebuilt the Savoy as a hospital,
he put it on record that he rebuilt it from the foundation; and there is nothing in the masonry or
mouldings of the architecture to lead us to any
conclusion but what this would indicate.  The
chapel was consecrated in or about <date value="1516">1516</date>, but its
history as a London church, strictly speaking, does
not begin until the following reign. The Protector
Somerset has been often found fault with for pulling
down the church of St. Mary-le-Strand; but as the
congregation took refuge at the Savoy Chapel, and
as this double employment, both as the chapel of a
collegiate foundation and also as the church of a
parish, led to its being connected with some remarkable men and some memorable events, and perhaps also saved it from utter ruin, those who are
interested in it do not regret the connection.
The parishioners of St. Mary's elected a chaplain
for themselves, and, by the permission of the Master






                   <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>

of the hospital, he preached and ministered in this
chapel. Some famous men held the office of Master,
and some famous men that also of Chaplain, but of
them all no name now stands out so prominently as
that of <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Thomas Fuller</persName>, who held the latter officein
the first year of the reign of Charles II.</p>
<p>There is nothing more remarkable than the way
in which the long perspective of past time brings
certain figures into prominence, while it suffers
others to fall out of sight. When we are near a
light-house, the waves seem to dash over it, and at
times even to conceal it. But when we are further away the waves are no more seen, while the
light shines out clearly and brightly.  And so,
when we read the life of a good man, when we note
the events of his career, when we enumerate his
friends, and, perhaps, examine the doings of his
enemies; while we trace his steps as he surmounted
difficulties, and avoided dangers, and fought through
obstructions, till he reached the goal, we are often
confused among the names and places, the people
and scenes, the events and complications by which
his course was marked. But when, after a time,
we begin to forget his immediate surroundings, when
he becomes more of a historical character to us, we
are able to estimate his greatness by the way in which
his deeds or his words are still like shining lights
among us; and as the people among whom he lived
and worked become hidden in the obscurity of ages,
we are able to observe how his figure comes out from

those of its associates, and illustrates the same truth
now which centuries ago he strove to point to his contemporaries. It is thus, in a remarkable decree, with
the character of <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName>. As the quaint epitaph on
his monument at Cranford states, he spent his life
making others immortal, and thereby attained immortality himself; a sentence which is true of him
in a double sense, for though the reference is there
first to his great work, the "Worthies of England," it
also holds good to the work he performed as a clergyman, and especially to that part of his work which
was performed in the Savoy, and among the predecessors of the congregation who still assemble
where he for the last time preached the gospel of
peace.</p>
  <p>Born in <date value="1608">1608</date>, <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Thomas Fuller</persName> was in the prime of
life when the great troubles of the Civil War broke
upon his country. He lived one year only after the
Restoration, and died at the comparatively early
age of 53. His career was thus passed among
events and trials sufficient to make most men partisans, and to cloud over the most even temperaments. But it is <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName>'s greatest praise that, living
in the midst of strife, he took no part in it; that
nothing shook his faith; that no employment caused
him to deviate from the strict path of duty; that
the end of his labours was to spread abroad the
knowledge of truth, to comfort the fatherless and
the widow, to show the cheerfulness of an undaunted
Christian spirit, and to make all men know the






                  <pb id="p.139" n="139"/>

possibility of moderation, when passion and prejudice were the ruling powers. What his faith was
may be learnt from the quaint sentence he has put
into one of his epigrams. It refers to his own name,
and is a fair specimen of the solemn play on words
in which he so much delighted. It is headed "A
Prayer :
      <quote rend="blockquote">-My Soul is stained with a dusty colour,-
      <lb/>Let thy Son be the sope, I'll be the Fuller.</quote>
And elsewhere, speaking of his infirmities being
known to God, he says, most devoutly, <quote>As for
other stains and spots upon my soul, I hope that
He (be it spoken without the least verbal reflection),
who is the <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName>'s sope, Mal. iii. 2, will scour them
forth with His merit, that I may appear clean by
God's mercy.</quote> And when asked to make an epitaph
for himself, it is said that he humbly replied, <quote>Let
it be, 'Here lies Fuller's earth.'</quote></p>
  <p><persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName> began his ministrations in the Savoy,
according to his latest biographer, Mr. Bailey,
in the year <date value="1641">1641</date>, and he remained here at first
for three years. He was in London, therefore, in
the most exciting times; and his preaching was
thought so much of that it was said he had two
congregations, one within the church, and the
other consisting of those who could not get in,
but crowded about the windows and doors to get
within reach of his voice. It is possibly in reference to the hour-glass in the pulpit here that
he says, speaking of another preacher, Dr. Holdsworth,




<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>

 that <quote>whereas the London people honour
their pastors for a short hour, his was measured by
a large glass:</quote> a sentence which may well be
applied to his own preaching. He used his influence, not in adding to the violence of party feeling,
which then ran so high, but in endeavouring by all
means in his power to make peace among the contending factions; and among the sermons of his
which are still extant, there is one, preached here
with this aim in December, <date value="1642">1642</date>, just as the
terrible war broke out. He chose for his text
the words, <quote> Blessed are the peace-makers,</quote> and
said, <quote> We used to end our sermons with a blessing: Christ begins his with the beatitudes; and of
the eight my text is neither the last nor the
least.</quote>  The best work, he says, is peace-making,
and the best wages, that they who make peace
are <quote>blessed</quote>. Advocating peace, then, he is careful to be moderate even in this, refusing to ask
for peace at any price, but peace without any sacrifice of truth. Yet the sword, he says, is the worst
way of finding truth, for <quote> it cannot discern between
truth, error, and falsehood; it may have two edges,
but it hath never an eye.</quote></p>
  <p>In addition to this sermon, he has left us an
essay on " Moderation," which is well worth reading
at the present day. He defines moderation in a few
admirable sentences: it <quote> is not a halting between
two opinions.</quote> . . . <quote>Neither is it a lukewarmness
in those things wherein God's glory is concerned.






                  <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>

But it is a mixture of discretion and charity in one's
judgment.</quote> <quote> The lukewarm man,</quote> he continues,
<quote> eyes only his own ends and particular profit; the
moderate man aims at the good of others and the
unity of the Church.</quote></p>
  <p>Toward the middle of <date value="1643">1643</date>, he was forced to fly
from the Savoy. He did so with the utmost regret,
following King Charles to Oxford. His last sermon
preached in this church before his departure is also
still extant, and prefixed to it is an epistle <quote> to my
dear parish, St. Mary, Savoy,</quote> full of touching allusions to his sorrow at leaving them, and his hope
that peace might at length return. <quote>The longer,</quote>
he says, <quote>I see this war, the less I like it, and the
more I loath it. Not so much because it threatens
temporal ruin to our kingdom, as because it will
bring a general spiritual hardness of hearts. And
if this war long continues, we may be affected for
the departure of charity, as the Ephesians were
at the going away of St. Paul, sorrowing most of
all that we shall see the face thereof no more.</quote></p>
  <p><persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName> followed the King's army to the field, and
endeavoured to do what he could to succour the
wounded and comfort the dying. Another preacher
took possession of his pulpit here, and he himself,
like many of the clergy of his time, when the war
was over, wandered from one place to another,
patronised by moderate men, and loved by all. He
says: <quote>For the first five years during our actual civil
wars, I had little list or leisure to write, fearing to






<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>

be made a history, and shifting daily for my safety.
All that time I could not live to study, but did only
study to live.</quote> Yet during this time he projected
and in part composed his works, the " Church History " and the "Worthies of England;" the latter,
however, not being finished till just before his death.
In <date value="1645">1645</date>, he came back to the Savoy for a time, but his
own flock was dispersed by the troubles, and it was
said of him, as of his Divine Master, <quote> He came to
his own, and his own received him not.</quote> The few
who remained were overawed by the factions which
divided London, and were in daily fear between the
Presbyterians and the Independents. Yet he preferred a London congregation to any other, for he
said, some clergymen wished for a Lincolnshire
church, as best built, and others for a Lancashire
parish, as the largest, but he liked a London
audience, as consisting of the most intelligent
people. He did not stay here long, however. He
would not give up the Liturgy, and the penalties for
using it were fixed that very year at &#x00A3;5 for the first
offence, &#x00A3;10 for the second, and a year's imprisonment for the third. He was, therefore, thrown on
his own resources, and his means were very small,
and wholly insufficient for the support of himself
and the education of his son. Brighter days were
in store, and he was allowed to remain unmolested
as Vicar of Waltham, and afterwards as Rector of
Cranford, until the Restoration, when we find him
again at the Savoy.</p>





                 <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>

  <p>But, in the meantime, its precincts had been
further consecrated to him by a melancholy event.
His friend, Lord Montagu of Boughton, being suspected by the party in power and arrested, was
imprisoned, or rather kept in some kind of restraint,
in the Savoy, although a person of <quote> great reverence,</quote> as we are told, <quote> and above fourscore years
of age ;</quote> and, after about two years' confinement,
he died here. In <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName>'s "Worthies" he is thus
spoken of:-<quote> To have no bands in their death is
an outward favour many wicked have, many godly
men want; amongst whom this good Lord, who
died in restraint at the Savoy, on account of his
loyalty to his Sovereign.</quote></p>
  <p><persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName>'s return to the Savoy was marked by such
a welcome as few preachers have ever been accorded.
His sermons, in which he had formerly endeavoured
to preserve peace, now that the war was over, were
directed to the mitigation of the cruelties of the
party in power. Their influence is mentioned by
many of his contemporaries, and among others by
<persName key="Pepys, Samuel">Pepys</persName>, the diarist. Witty as all his utterances
were they were always within bounds. As his biographer says, his wit is all but invariably allied to
wisdom, <quote> and very few would rise from the perusal
of his pulpit utterances, with a feeling that they
had been in the company of one who was irreverent
or undevout.</quote> Craik said of him, in his " History of
English Literature," that <quote>there is probably neither
an ill-natured nor a profane witticism in all that





<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>

<persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName> has written.</quote> He was strongly of opinion
that sermons should be short, and in his account of
an ideal " Faithful Minister," he speaks of him as
<quote>one who makes not that wearisome which should
ever be welcome;</quote> adding, in his quaint way, an
anecdote of a certain professor, <quote> who, being to expound the prophet Esay to his auditors, read 21
years on the first chapter, and yet finished it not.</quote></p>
  <p>And now we come to the close. <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName> was made,
without solicitation, a Royal Chaplain, and prepared
a sermon to preach at court. But it was otherwise
ordered. Before the day appointed for its delivery,
the preacher had left the pulpit for ever. A greater
King had summoned him. On the <date value="1661-08-12">12th of August,
1661</date>, being Sunday, he preached in the Savoy. It
was for the last time. He felt unwell, and his friends
would have kept him from making the exertion.
But a member of the congregation was to be married
on the following day, Monday, and <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName> lovingly
undertook to wish the wedding couple well in a
special sermon, a good custom which still obtains
in the Savoy. He said he <quote> had often gone into the
pulpit sick, but always came down well, and he
hoped he should do as well now by God's strengthening grace.</quote> Before he began, he told his congregation he felt ill, but by a strong exertion he got
through, and, as his biographer records, <quote>he very
pertinently concluded.</quote> A christening was to have
followed, and he would have made an effort to
officiate; but the fever had now taken its hold.





                <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>

He was carried from the church half fainting, and,
being taken to his lodgings close by, he was put
to his bed, and he never rose from it again. So
Monday and Tuesday passed, and on Wednesday he
was much worse. He had been insensible, but as
his strength abated his senses returned.  Many
friends stood round him. He begged them to pray
for him, and joined fervently with them, <quote>recommending himself, with all humble thankfulness and
submission, to God's welcome Providence.</quote> He
would not, as the last scene drew near, allow anyone
to weep. He begged them to restrain themselves,
to refrain from tears, and spoke of his departure as
a translation to a happy eternity. Though he had
before counselled men to make their wills early
in life, that so, when they came to die, they
might <quote>have nothing to do but to die,</quote> he had
made no will himself, having probably little to
leave. And now he refused to be disturbed by any
thought of worldly affairs.  Even the book by
which his name has chiefly lived, and which was
still unpublished, he did not speak of at all. His
thoughts were all engaged on the world to which he
was hastening. No regret for the career which
had so lately been re-opened to him-no sorrow for
the loss of the Bishopric to which he was already
designated-nothing but love to those around him,
and hope of the heaven before him. One more
night he lived, and on the morning of Thursday,
the 18th, passed away in peace; and so, as his







<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>

biographer says, <quote>The last view of the faithful
minister represents him as assuming, in place of
the lawn of the Prelate, the shining raiment, exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth
can white it: a whiteness mixed with no shadow;
a light dimmed with no darkness.</quote></p>

<p>THE   removal of such a landmark as
           Northumberland House must be the
           cause of a certain amount of regret.
           Sorrow is much tempered, however, by
an examination of the interior of the building. If
ever a building could be said to have put its best
foot first, it was this. The centre of the Strand
front, and the turrets at either end, are all that
was beautiful or interesting in the whole house.
After them, any enthusiasm which might have
been felt for its preservation had to depend on the
historical, sentimental, and archaeological associations of the place. And they are but meagre.
The fact that Northumberland House is the last of
a row of palaces which once began at Baynard's
Castle, in the City, and ended at Westminster Hall,
gave it a claim to our regard. Within the walls
one or two remarkable events took place, and
General Monk here held some of his meetings with
the Royalists before the restoration of Charles II.
And the plan, which was of the type known in
France as <foreign lang="FR">entre cour et jardin</foreign>, becomes extinct





<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>

among us by the demolition. It would not be
easy to say any more than this in its favour. It
was as ugly, as inconvenient, and probably as
uncomfortable a family residence as any in London. Many people are by no means convinced
of the expediency of removing it; and it may
turn out that the public will not gain materially
by the sacrifice. It must be remembered that not
only do we take away a relic of antiquity with
a fair amount of historical interest attaching to
it, but we do so at the expense of half a million
of money; and, as far as we are aware, no
very commendable design for utilising the site
acquired at such an expense both of feeling and of
cash has yet been put forward.</p>
  <p>The history of Northumberland House has been
detailed more or less correctly in almost every
London newspaper within the last two years, and
is to be found, with less, rather than more, correctness, in all the London guide-books. In reality,
however, there is very little to tell about it. The
street front only towards the Strand bore any
traces of the work of Bernard Janson or Gerard
Christmas, and even this was greatly altered and
not improved. It had over the oriel the initials
and badges of Algernon Seymour, who was Duke of
Somerset for fourteen months, from <date value="1748">1748</date> to <date value="1750">1750</date>,
and who had inherited the representation of the
Percies on the death of his mother some five-and-
twenty years before. His daughter, Lady Elizabeth
<figure id="Fig.016" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.023.DO01.00016"><head>GATEWAY, NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE.</head></figure>






                       <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>

Smithson, carried on the reparation and alteration
of the house in conjunction with her husband,
who was the first Duke of Northumberland of the
present family. In their time probably the corner
turrets were lowered to the height they had before
the demolition. Towards the end of the last
century any marks of antiquity remaining were
carefully wiped off the exterior, and a fire some
few years ago completed the transformation of
the interior. The side next the Strand had
originally an open-work parapet, formed of the
letters of a motto, probably that of the busy and
scheming Henry Howard, Surrey's second son,
who was Earl of Northampton during ten years
before <date value="1614">1614</date>, and who built the house. A letter fell
down in <date value="1619">1619</date>, during the passage of the funeral of
Queen Anne of Denmark from    Somerset House,
and killed a bystander, for which reason the other
letters were removed. At least so runs the story,
with the impossible addition that it was the letter
S from Esperance en Dieu; how the Percy motto
came on the parapet more than twenty years before
the Percies themselves came into the house, we are
not informed. In fact, to judge from a letter quoted
in the recent Report of the Historical Manuscripts
Commission, the family had no town house at this
time, for one of them writes in <date value="1623">1623</date> to Lord
Middlesex to excuse himself from calling on him,
because he has no house nearer town than Syon.
There is some difficulty, too, in the received accounts





<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>
of the descent of Northampton House, first to
Suffolk and then to Northumberland. Mr. Craik
expressly states that the Earl who built it gave it
as a New Year's gift to his grandnephew, the second
Earl of Suffolk; but it is not easy to believe that
Northampton did anything so generous except for a
consideration. Lord Suffolk again gave it away.
Perhaps it was a kind of white elephant. It must
have always been expensive to keep up. But
Suffolk's son-in-law was well able to make use of
the gift. From his time it is identified with the
fortunes of the Percies, and during the Commonwealth and afterwards was the scene of many of
those dubious but apparently successful efforts
which the tenth Earl made for keeping himself in
power under any form of government. His granddaughter, the wife of the <soCalled> Proud </soCalled> Duke of Somerset, and the favourite of Queen Anne, is immortalised as much by Swift's hatred as by her strange
history and great possessions. It was when the
Irish Dean lampooned her for her red hair, warning
England to beware of carrots from Northumberland,
and accusing the Duchess of complicity in the
murder of her second husband, the victim of
Konigsmark, that he cut himself off for ever from
all chances of a seat on the bench of Bishops.</p>
<p>Northumberland House must have been singularly
unsuited to the requirements of family life at the
present day. The street front was practically
separated from the rest of the house, and contained





   <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>

at least two unconnected residences. The rest of
the house resembled an H in plan. The cross-bar
was formed by an entrance-hall or corridor, with
some reception rooms towards the garden. This
was said to have been originally built by <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo
Jones</persName>, but it retained no traces of his handiwork.
Two wings at the back partly enclosed the garden,
that on the west containing a great gallery upwards
of a hundred feet in length, but badly lighted; the
east wing consisted only of offices. There was a
low wall beyond the garden towards the embankment, but the view over the river was neither
extensive nor attractive, its chief feature being the
dome of Bedlam, which rose conspicuously in the
background, flanked by tall chimneys. Bedlam,
indeed, has travelled nearly all round <placeName key="Charing
Cross">Charing
Cross</placeName>. It stood three centuries ago near the site of
the present National Gallery, whence it migrated to
Bishopsgate, and at last went across the river and
settled down exactly opposite its original station.
The garden, owing to the slope of the ground, is at
a much lower level than the Strand front, and has
the cheerful and verdant appearance of other
London gardens where the grass has grown long
and rank, and only half covers the naked clay
below, while the trees are miserably stunted and
black with smoke. The great staircase stood to the
left of the entrance. It probably supplanted an
older, and possibly a more picturesque, structure
on the same site, under Janson's turret, but for a






<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>

long time it had been the best feature of the house.
Yet, costly as was the ormolu balustrade, and handsome as were the marble steps and pilasters, they
were not much more substantial than the ornaments
of the other parts of the house, in which stucco,
gilding, and scagliola were the chief ingredients in
a magnificent effect. When the walls were covered
with tapestry or pictures, and especially when the
floors were occupied with people, all must have
looked very different. At Knole or Haddon the
architectural features which would disappear with
the furniture might not be very great; the windows,
the oaken floors, the panelled walls, the groined
roofs would still remain. In Northumberland
House there was nothing of this kind-nothing, in
fact, but what might be expected when we read in
Brayley's description that at the beginning of the
present century a very general repair took place
under the direction of the brothers Adam. Even
this, however, will hardly account for its being
more ugly by many degrees than the Adelphi
Terrace, though it will account for the prevalence
everywhere of plaster work and paint for stone.
Successive architects, including, it is true, many of
eminence, had managed to reduce it in two hundred
and fifty years to an extreme of ugliness seldom, if
ever, equalled even in London. So many cooks never
perhaps before more completely ruined a pudding.
And nothing could have improved it. The faulty
arrangement by which the best rooms were hidden




                     <pb id="p.153" n="153"/>

from the sun, which must have shone chiefly on
the offices and seldom on the inhabited parts; the
absence of those conveniences of hot air and water
which are now to be found in the most humble
dwellings; the interminable length of corridors and
passages; the want of concentration; the suites of
apartments which opened only out of one another,
and were therefore almost useless for the purposes
of modern life,-all these things must have made
Northumberland House a singularly disagreeable
residence, notwithstanding its great dignity.</p>
  <p>The change when it is swept away will be very
great, but the difficulties of making a good use of
the site will be almost insuperable. The slope to
the level of the Embankment is steep, and would
admit of very picturesque treatment, but as the
direct road will not square with any of the existing
roads or buildings, it is difficult to see how any
better design than that of Sir James Pennethorne
can be suggested. By this scheme the destruction
of Northumberland House might have been avoided;
and a graceful curve, such as that which produces
in the Quadrant in Regent Street one of the most
satisfactory architectural effects in London, might
have been happily employed. To lay out the slope
with terraces and flower-beds may perhaps be
thought a pleasing idea, but it is hardly worth the
price paid for it. If buildings are to occupy the
ground with a street leading straight to the Embankment, the hill must be such as to make the





<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>

approach to the river extremely inconvenient; and
if traffic cannot be persuaded at present to use the
road through Whitehall Place, neither will it be
tempted by a heavy declivity to drive over the site
of Northumberland House.</p>
  <p>A very much more sweeping measure, by which
the magnificent bend of the river at this point
might have been made available for a pictorial
effect, could only be carried out by some Baron
Haussmann. Yet short of something of this kind
it will be almost impossible to do anything at <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> which will be a real improvement. When
Whitehall with its gateway blocked the road to
Westminster; when Spring Gardens and Leicester
Fields, and the Abbot's Garden and Long Acre surrounded the village of Charing, while the river lay
open at the fourth side and the great spire of St.
Paul's was visible from Hedge Lane or the Reading
Road, the place of Northumberland House was filled
by the alien Priory of St. Mary Rouncival, whose
chapel extended to the water's edge; and if we
could bring back the ancient buildings as well as
the gardens, and could make a break in the endless
row of brick walls which covers so many miles
without interruption, we should do something satisfactory with the place. But, short of the execution
of some wild scheme like this, nothing will now
much improve the appearance of <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>;
all the land we have bought for our five hundred
thousand pounds is a mere flea-bite, and all that





                    <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

can be done with it is of very little consequence.
We shall be glad of course if it can, even in part,
be left without buildings; but we must have all felt
that sooner or later, with or without good reason,
Northumberland House was doomed to go. Just
two hundred years ago the progress of the spirit of
improvement began on this bank of the Thames by
the removal of Essex House, which with its gardens
was outside Temple Bar. Steadily has the wave
swept forward till Paget House and Arundel House,
Durham House and York House, and many more,
have one by one disappeared. The palace of the
Protector Somerset retains not even the ancient
plan. Of the Savoy there is nothing left but the
chapel; and Northumberland House alone survived

  <p>A HUNDRED      years ago and upwards
           London was surrounded at a short distance by villas: they could be reached
           from town in about the same time by
a coach and four which it now takes us to get
thirty miles into the country. Such were Arlington House, now Buckingham Palace; Nottingham
House, now Kensington Palace; Canons, Tottenham
Court, and, in older times, Havering, Greenwich,
and Kennington. Montagu House (now the British
Museum), and Bedford House (the gardens of which
remain as Bedford Square), Apsley House, and
Burlington House, were a little nearer home; but
excepting those which are more or less in public
hands, as national institutions or royal palaces,
almost all have been overwhelmed by the tide of
brick and mortar which daily creeps further and
obliterates more and more the gardens and green
fields. Fulham Manor House, the country residence or <soCalled> palace </soCalled> of the Bishop of London, is an
exception, as we shall see in the next chapter; but
it has little of the picturesque to recommend it to





              <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>

sight-seers, although it is probably the oldest inhabited house in England. Lambeth Palace is, strictly
speaking, a town house; and it would not be easy for
me to name a third suburban residence of the kind
if I pass over that whose name heads this page.</p>
  <p>Holland House, therefore, is interesting to Londoners as the relic of an age and a phase of manners
now long gone by. And it is, moreover, interesting
intrinsically for three things in which it has few
rivals in England: its beauty, its historical associations, and the works of art it contains. It is, to
begin with the first of these, a very charming
specimen of a style of architecture which should
commend itself to the tastes of Englishmen, as the
last of native growth. The development of art in
building presents a regular series or succession,
from the days when our Saxon ancestors dwelt in
wooden huts or in hovels of mud and stone to the
days when Sir Walter Cope founded the centre and
turrets of Cope Castle, in the manor of Kensington,
and when his son-in-law, the first Earl of Holland,
changed its name to Holland House, and completed
the building.  There is perhaps no contrast in
nature more pleasing than the artificial one between
red brick and green trees.  It makes even the
square, pseudo-Italian mansion of the Georgian
period look picturesque in a well-timbered park;
and as we approach Holland House from among
the narrow crowded streets or the lath-and-plaster
of the new suburbs, the views through an avenue of





<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>

ancient elms, green even in London, of the quaint
red turrets, the shaped gables, the arcaded terraces,
the many-paned oriels, are twice as charming
as anything that has been built so near London
since. We first see the south side of the house.
It is the most picturesque, and was formerly the
front. But now the avenue passes to the east of
the house, and the hall door is at what used to be
the back. Beyond are the pleasure-grounds and the
Dutch garden, with their yew hedges, clipped borders, heavy cedars, statues, avenues, arbours, and
archways. Everything is in the state in which our
generation found it when they came into the world.
Nothing of any importance has been altered, for
though the public entrance is now on the north, the
fabric of the building is hardly disturbed. As I
have said, the old entrance was at the south side;
facing it were <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName>'s piers and gateway, and
the front of the house was thus first approached by
the visitor. Now, the piers have been removed to
a terrace in the pleasure-ground; the porch leads
only into a garden, and the chief entrance is at the
eastern side. On the whole, however, few exteriors
of the period have been less altered than this, a fact
the more remarkable when we remember the
number of different families by which the estate has
been held, and its so dangerous proximity to the
metropolis.</p>
  <p>The mention of the different owners to whom the
place has belonged brings us to the historical associations





  <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>

which crowd about Holland House. It
may be said that any house more than two centuries
old and less than two miles from London must be
full of such memories. This is, perhaps, true; but
the names which occur to the memory with the
mention of Holland House are such as no other
place of the kind can boast. Lord Macaulay, himself
something more than a name to be only mentioned
in this connection, says of it in a famous essay, and
speaking only of one generation, that the survivors-
now, alas! few, if any-will remember how the last
debate was discussed in one corner of the Library
and the last comedy of Scribe in another, <quote>while
Wilkie gazed with modest admiration on Sir
Joshua's Baretti, while Mackintosh turned over
Thomas Aquinas to verify a quotation, while
Talleyrand related his conversation with Barras at
the Luxembourg, or his ride with Lannes over the
field of Austerlitz.</quote> These are only the names of
one generation; but in a charmingly illustrated book,
written by a lady<note place="foot" n="1">"Holland House," by Princess Marie Leichtenstein.
Macmillan &#x0026; Co. <date value="1874">1874</date>.</note> who long resided at Holland
House, we are enabled to trace the steps of many
other great men and women, and to bring the history
and memories of the place down to the present day.
There are so many interesting facts to be recalled
that it would be impossible, in our present limits, to
do more than mention a tithe of them. But as the
history of a lady who narrowly missed becoming


<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>

Queen of England occurs among them, and is, on
the whole, less known than some of the others, I
will confine myself for a few pages to it alone.
I may take her story, then, passing by the many
anecdotes of Addison, of Charles James Fox and
others of his name, of the first Lady Holland (Lady
Sarah's sister), of the second Lady, of the third,
who is the Lady Holland of Macaulay, of Sydney
Smith, Lord Lansdowne, Hookham Frere, Rogers,
Brougham, and many more whose lives belong
either to the history of our literature, or to that of
the country at large.</p>
  <p>Lady Sarah Lennox was the daughter of Charles,
second Duke of Richmond, grandson of Charles II.
and the Duchess of Portsmouth.  Her mother was
Sarah, daughter and co-heiress of William, first Earl
Cadogan. Everyone who visited the Royal Academy
during the exhibition of Old Masters some years
ago will remember a charming picture by Reynolds,
in which Charles James Fox, then about thirteen,
is represented walking in the garden of Holland
House with his cousin Lady Susan Strangways,
while his young aunt, Lady Sarah Lennox, looks
pitying from between the mullions of an oriel
window at the dead bird which Lady Susan
holds up to her. This picture is at Holland
House, and a great part of Princess Leichtenstein's book is taken up with stories of the
three figures represented in it. Walpole speaks
of Lady Sarah's beauty at an early age: <quote>When


        <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>

Lady Sarah was in white, with her hair about her
ears, and on the ground, no Magdalen by Correggio
was half so lovely and expressive.</quote> Her sister was
the wife of the owner of Holland House, and Walpole saw her there on this occasion in an amateur
theatrical performance.  Her brother-in-law described her (in a memoir in MS. preserved at Holland House) as having <quote>the finest Complexion, most
beautifull Hair, and prettyest Person that ever was
seen, with a sprightly and fine Air, a pretty Mouth
and remarkably fine Teeth, and excess of bloom in
her Cheeks, little Eyes,</quote> and so on; but he adds:
<quote>Her Great Beauty was a peculiarity of Countenance, that made Her at the same time different
from, and prettyer than, any other Girl, I ever
saw.</quote> The father of this marvel of perfection was
one of the Lords of the Bedchamber to George II.,
whose grandson, the young Prince of Wales, had
many opportunities of seeing and admiring Lady
Sarah. In some papers by Mr. Henry Napier, we
are informed that his admiration <quote>ripened into an
attachment which, as I have been told, never left
him, even in his most unsettled moments, until the
day of his death.</quote>  When he ascended the throne
as George III. she was but fifteen, and seems to
have been as free from affectation, and, indeed, as
sweet a character, as any we read of.  She refused
one day to tell a lie-even a white one-to please
the King, and we find him saying of her that he
liked her because she spoke her mind so frankly,



<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>

and was so utterly devoid of guile.  The King,
according to Mr. Napier, made a confidant of Lady
Susan Strangways, asking her at a Court ball when
Lady Sarah was not present, <q type="spoken">When she meant to
leave town?</q>  <q type="spoken">I intend to remain for the Coronation, Sir,</q> was her reply. <q type="spoken">But,</q> said the King,
 <q type="spoken">there will be no Coronation until there is a Queen,
and I think your friend is the fittest person for it;
tell your friend so from me.</q></p>
  <p>The next time Lady Sarah Lennox appeared
at Court the young King led her aside and asked,
<q type="spoken">Has your friend told you of my conversation
with her?</q>   <q type="spoken">Yes, Sir.</q>  <q type="spoken">And what do you
think of it ? Tell me, for my happiness depends
on it! </q> But whether Lady Sarah was frightened
at the giddy elevation thus offered her, or really
did not fancy the King, or had some other attachment, or, as is more likely, already showed signs
of the good sense and presence of mind which
she transmitted in so large a measure to her sons,
her only answer was, <q type="spoken"> Nothing.</q></p>
  <p>We next hear of her as romping with an old playmate, Lord Newbottle, and apparently forgetful of her
Royal admirer. Then she goes into Somersetshire,
gets thrown from her horse, and breaks her leg.
On this event Lord Newbottle seems to have jested,
while the King was full of tenderness, making
anxious inquiries, and even, it seems, proposing to
go to see her-greatly, no doubt, to the horror of the
Court officials. When her brother-in-law, Mr. Fox,


<pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

and her uncle, Mr. Conolly, are at the Palace,
George is most particular in his inquiries, and
shudders at the description of her sufferings. This
was in <date value="1761-04">April, 1761</date>, and in a few months we find her
again at Holland House, and the King's attentions
more marked than ever, though it seems as if, after
the rebuff he had received, he took care not formally to renew his offer. Meanwhile, the courtiers
were alarmed, and especially the members of the
Royal family.  Something must be done at once.
Lord Bute, and with him probably the Princess
Dowager, opposed the idea with their utmost influence. Colonel Graeme was deputed to visit various
little Protestant courts, and to report upon their
eligible Princesses. The King left it to the Privy
Council whether he should marry to please himself,
or to satisfy the claims of Royal rank. The Council
decided against him, and he submitted.  Princess
Charlotte of Mecklenburg was chosen, her name was
announced to the Council on the 1st July, and on the
16th the romance of his youth came to an end. The
King and Lady Sarah met; the King was confused;
the lady was dignified, nay even, we read, cross,
and in secret she confesses that she had a <soCalled>cry</soCalled>
of two hours' duration. But the sickness and death
of a pet squirrel immediately took up all her attention; she wept longer for it than for the loss of a
crown, and we find her shortly afterwards first
bridesmaid at the Royal marriage, when the King
kept his eyes fixed on her during the whole ceremony,




<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>
and Lord Westmoreland, who was near-sighted, mistook her for the new Queen; and then
we only know of her further relations with Royalty
that the King never forgot his friendship for her,
and that the Queen behaved to her throughout life
with undeviating kindness.  In <date value="1762">1762</date> she married
Sir Charles Bunbury, and after his death Colonel
George Napier, a younger son of the Merchistoun
House, and by him became the mother of Sir
Charles, Sir George, and Sir William  Napier,
brothers whose achievements reflect more lustre
upon her than even the King's admiration could
have done. Once more we hear of her in a touching
anecdote which connects her name and his. In <date value="1814">1814</date>
Dean Andrews preached a sermon in aid of an institution for the relief of the blind. The preacher
spoke of the King's blindness, and the interest
he had taken in this infirmary from his sad experience.  It was in St. James's Church, and a
person who was present relates that on one of
the seats sat an elderly lady, who appeared to
feel deeply these allusions in the sermon.  She
wept tenderly, and at the end of the service was
led out of church, being herself helpless from loss
of sight. It was Lady Sarah. She survived both
the King and Queen, and died in <date value="1826">1826</date>, preserving
her remarkable beauty until the end.</p>
  <p>So much for Lady Sarah Lennox. Whether
King George did wisely or not may be a question.
But speculators on what might have been, can





                           <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

hardly help contrasting the active and heroic lives
of the sons of Colonel Napier, with the miserably
selfish and degraded careers of more than one of
the sons of George III.</p>
  <p>I must not take leave of Holland House without
a moment's glance at the wonders of the interior.
Taking the Library Passage alone, a kind of
museum in itself, we find there Addison's portrait,
about the authenticity of which authorities are so
much divided; next a picture of Benjamin Franklin, then Lope de Vega; then a copy of Titian's
Galileo, and Machiavelli, Locke, and Madame de
Sevigne.  A sketch of Edward VI. by George
Vertue, the engraver, presented by Horace Walpole,
and a drawing by Reynolds of Lord Ossory, are
among the minor portraits.  Then a photograph of
the members of the Congress of Paris in <date value="1856">1856</date>, with
the signatures of the assembled Plenipotentiaries
below; near it a miniature of Catherine of Russia,
with an autograph letter annexed.  On either side
of the Empress are the likenesses of Napoleon and
Robespierre; and near the photograph of the Congress a miniature of the Prince Regent, a little bust
of Earl Grey, and a portrait of George Tierney.
Fox has written on the back of Robespierre's likeness, <quote> <foreign lang="FR">un scelerat, un lache, et un fou</foreign>.</quote>  In other
parts of the room  are pen-and-ink sketches of
Gibbon, Voltaire and his friends, a letter from Voltaire, the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle at dinner,
a view of Beethoven's Cabinet by moonlight, a






<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>

crowquill portrait of the Young Pretender, Joseph
Addison's last signature, of which a fac-simile is
given, as well as of the Empress Catherine's letter,
and above this autograph a frame containing a
piece of wood from the door of the room at Ferrara
in which Ariosto died in <date value="1533">1533</date>.  The passage also
contains portraits of Milton, Burke, Reynolds,
Benedict XIV., and George Selwyn. The author of
the book mentioned above tells this anecdote of
the window of the Library Passage :- <quote>In the
southern window is a pane of glass, removed from
the window of what, we believe, used to be Rogers'
dressing-room in the east turret. Upon this frame
of glass are cut some lines by Hookham Frere.
They date from October, <date value="1811">1811</date>, and run as follows :
     <quote rend="blockquote">May neither fire destroy nor waste impair
     <lb/>Nor time consume thee till the twentieth Heir,

To which we add a devout amen! and to which

THERE is perhaps something of paradox
       in saying that, though Fulham Manor
          House is, in all probability, the oldest
          villa residence in England, it has not a
single feature which dates further back than the
middle of the sixteenth century. Yet undoubtedly





<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>

the manor belonged to the Bishop of London long
before the days of the Confessor, even though we
hesitate to accept Wharton's dicitur that it was
granted to St. Erkenwald by Tyrhtilus of Hereford
in or about the year <date value="691">691</date>, with the consent of
Sigehard, King of the East Saxons, and Conrad,
King of the Mercians. Bishop Erkenwald is no
more a mythical personage than his recent namesake, Bishop Archibald; nor yet is Bishop Tyrhtilus.
But all we know with certainty of Fulham is that
before the Conquest it was held directly of the King-by the service of praying for the royal soul; and that
it was probably granted to an early Bishop by the
King himself. In point of antiquity as an episcopal
residence, Hartlebury almost equals it. The Bishops
of Worcester have resided there since the foundation
of the see, but, like Fulham, little or nothing remains
to it of any building erected before the fifteenth century. In historical interest Fulham far surpasses
its western contemporary, for all the Bishops of
London have occupied it; and some of the most
important events in the annals of the Church have
their scenes laid within its boundaries. It has
never indeed vied with <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName>, except in its
superior antiquity. Nor has it, like the Kentish
manors of the Archbishops, been at any time
deemed worthy of royal envy.   Its nearness to
London seems even to have saved it from the perils
of any royal visits except those of the progress-
loving Elizabeth and James. And perhaps this very

<pb id="p.169" n="169"/>

nearness has also saved it in other ways, and will
account for its being so little known among sightseers. It is too far for the regular London visitant,
and too near for a special excursion. Parties of
pleasure to Putney or Wimbledon point, as they
cross the bridge, to the <soCalled>palace</soCalled> buried among its
trees: a certain air of mystery seems to hang over
it,-no one has time to stop and go out of the way
to visit it. And so it has remained where it was
placed a thousand years ago or more, till the very
earth all around it has grown up and helps to hide
it from the great city which surges, street after
street, villa after villa, up to the very moat, and,
passing by, gathers again on the other side, but
leaves it alone.</p>
  <p>There is a sleepy air about it too. The little red
court, the quiet gardens, the dark trees, slumber in
the summer sunshine: in winter they seem to
hibernate. When the Bishop holds a reception,
and Compton's fine avenue by the moat, and the
little entrance lodge, and the low gateway echo with
the driving of carriage wheels, while clerical friends
and gaily dressed ladies exchange salutations on the
sandy sweep or the smooth-turfed lawn, the genius
of the place seems to vanish. To recall it we must
visit Bishop Tait's chapel, or the library of Bishop
Porteus at opposite extremities of the garden
front, and while studying the brown-backed folios,
or scanning the solemn row of portraits, or endeavouring to identify the mitred escutcheons in the





<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>

windows, to renew the memories which still haunt
the place, and people it with figures more in
accordance with its historical dignity. It is true,
this range of building is wholly modern. Fulham
was visited in <date value="1715">1715</date> by Vanbrugh and Wren-
ominous names-and all that lay to the northward,
the bake-house, the pastry-house, and many other
(now  disused) offices of the ancient Episcopal
menage, were removed, while in more recent times
all that now fronts to the east was built, to use the
words of Brewer, <quote>in a style eminently chaste.</quote>
Still, some sixty rooms were left in the older part;
and to improve or restore these has been, though in
a languid way, befitting the character of the house,
the object of several successive occupants. Bishop
Blomfield and Archbishop Tait are to be thanked
for a more active course. Most of what is interesting now was preserved and created by their care.
The history of the house is clearly written on its
walls and in its surroundings. The new chapel, the
substantial rooms toward the garden, the red gables
of the older part, the venerable trees, the church
beyond just rising above the intervening foliage, are
all crowded with memories more or less sacred.
The very incongruities and anachronisms of the
building have their story. The summer house, in
which Bishop Bonner examined his victims, nestles
under the trees which Bishop Compton planted;
while the sunshine enters Bishop FitzJames's hall
through windows dight with the heraldry of Bishop


                 <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

Tunstall and Bishop Blomfield, and rests warmly
on the carved mantelpiece and panelling of Bishop
Sherlock.</p>
  <p>The name of Bonner seems to call up the clearest,
if one of the least pleasing, pictures. Many
attempts have been made of late to whitewash his
character, with but indifferent success. A stain is
upon his hand which all the perfumes of Araby will
not remove. He and his coadjutor Gardiner were
both men of base birth, and both connected apparently with some of the highest in the realm; but
Bonner owed his advancement to his own talents,
and to the skilful use he made of the opportunities
afforded him by the very movement he afterwards
attempted with such violence to repress. The same
vehemence which excited him so strenuously against
the Reformers had in his youth supported him
against the Pope himself; and while we reprehend the passion which blinded him in the furious
zeal of his later years, we must not forget the
strong influence which, in the commencement
of the struggle, his unflinching character had exercised. He had assisted to mould the mind of the
nation: when the mould had hardened, all his
efforts were in vain to break it, though he dashed
himself against it with the reckless daring of his
nature. When we think of him wearing out his
last years in the confinement of the Marshalsea,
like Jeffries in the Tower at a later date, we cannot
but picture to ourselves a terrible vision of disappointment


<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>
and rage. Ten years elapsed before his
body was worn out; yet even then it was deemed
unsafe that he should be buried in the sight of the
people. His coffin was carried at midnight to the
neighbouring parish church in Southwark, while his
successor at Fulham writes to Cecil to announce the
funeral, and adds, perhaps in unconscious irony,
the unconcerned postscript:- <quote>My grapes this year
are nott yet rype.</quote> So much for Bishop Bonner!
The same grapes were destined to cause Bishop
Grindal considerable uneasiness, and we somehow
do not feel sorry for him. A few days after the
burial he writes again:- <quote>I hear that some fault is
found with me abroad for sending of my servant
lately to the court with grapes, saying one died of
my house of the plague, as they say, and three
more are sick;</quote> but the charge was untrue.</p>
  <p>Between Bonner and Grindal properly comes a
greater name than either. Nicholas Ridley held
the see after the first deposition of Bonner and
until the death of Edward. There is little to connect him with Fulham, yet that little is to his
honour. He charitably allowed the mother of his
predecessor to reside at his manor house, though
her presence must have been extremely distasteful
to his scrupulous mind. Archbishop Heath, too,
shared his toleration and hospitality; but found it
convenient when faggots were blazing to forget both.</p>
  <p>There were quiet days after the fiery tempest,
while Aylmer rested at Fulham from the fatigues




                   <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

and dangers of exile, and was censured by the
Sabbatarians for playing in the bowling green on
Sunday afternoons; while Fletcher repaired the
hall, and offended the Queen by marrying Lady
Baker; while Bancroft called meetings of the
learned and projected the new translation of the
Bible, which he did not live to see completed;
while Vaughan preached by his good life, <quote>being,</quote>
as <persName key="Fuller, Thomas">Fuller</persName> says in his quaint way, <quote>a very corpulent
man, but spiritually minded ;</quote> until at length we
come to the stirring scenes in which Bishop Laud
took part, the storm that burst in the days of
Bishop Juxon, the war, the camp at Putney, the
bridge of boats, the King at Hampton Court, and
the Lord General with the City forces billeted at
Fulham. Then exile again, followed a second time
by years of peace, till Bishop Henchman died
in <date value="1675">1675</date>, and was buried in the middle aisle of the
church, under an inscription setting forth his
gravity and clemency, <quote><foreign lang="LA">quae vel in vultu elucebant</foreign>
(which even shone forth in his countenance;</quote>) and
Compton succeeded, in the days of the Declaration, when the Archbishop and he and five others
of his rank were committed to the Tower, and were
tried and acquitted in Westminster Hall.</p>
  <p>The figure of Compton is a prominent one at
Fulham. His father was a Royalist Earl killed at
Hopton. He himself began, as a cornet in the
Horse Guards, the longest public life in the lists of
the Bishops of London. The tutor of Mary and of





<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>

Anne, his sympathies were all with the Orange
party and against the policy and court of James.
His suspension from the exercise of the duties of
his office during the last two years of that reign
was the cause of a retirement to Fulham, the
marks of which are still, after the lapse of two
centuries, plainly visible. The trees planted by
Bishop Compton are yet pointed out; and the story
is still told under their shade of the old trooper
who took horse and escaped to William with the
Princess Anne riding behind him. Even such a
service was not, however, remembered to his advantage under the new regime, and the coveted
Archbishopric never reached him; though he lived
to be of the trio who, in <date value="1710">1710</date>, could say that the
Cathedral of St. Paul had been built under one
Bishop, one architect, and one clerk of the works.
In his later years he retired altogether to Fulham,
and here, in <date value="1713">1713</date>, he was buried in the churchyard,
under a plain tomb bearing a Greek inscription,
below the east window of the chancel. He had
said what many generations failed until our own
day to impress, that the church was for the living,
the churchyard for the dead; and his good example
was constantly followed in after years. A long
array of episcopal monuments towers on either side
of his modest tomb, Bishop Lowth and Bishop
Sherlock occupying the highest places in the goodly
company; afar off, in a retired corner overshadowed by trees, in earth which he had himself




                <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

consecrated, is the grave of Bishop Blomfield, while
a simple tablet in the porch is erected by his friends
and neighbours, and close to it is the little monument he had placed to the memory of his son, lost
at sea.</p>
  <p>Nine of the Bishops sleep in the churchyard,
including Gibson, Hayter, Robinson, and Randolph.
Bishop Porteus was buried at Sundridge, among
the Kentish hills. He was the courtly prelate who
replied to Queen Charlotte's question, <quote>May I knot
on Sunday ? </quote> with the polite ambiguity,  <quote>You may
not;</quote> and is remembered with gratitude both at
Fulham and Sundridge, for to his successors in the
see he gave his valuable library, and to the poor
of the country parish a handsome sum for the
dowry of the village maidens and the pension of the
widowed matrons.</p>
  <p>The church itself, which is only separated from
the Episcopal demesne by the churchyard, although
singularly unattractive outside, is worth a visit.
The tower alone is ancient, but has been recently
repaired with such success that there is little air of
antiquity remaining to it. The body of the church
is not older than the reign of Queen Anne, and is
oppressed with heavy galleries and proprietary
pews. But the monuments, which are numerous,
are worthy of inspection, the largest of them being
in the porch under the tower, while two more are in
the chancel, and the only ancient brass to be seen
is beside the vestry door. Lady Legh, with her





<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>

twins, is a good example of the seventeenth-century
taste; and we ask in vain, as we read her epitaph,
whether she is the heroine of the nursery rhyme ?
The great structure which commemorates Lord
Mordaunt, with a mendacious pedigree at one side,
and gauntlets, coronets, and shields all around, and
which resembles so closely a fountain with a statue
in the centre, is in the porch, and opposite to it the
tablet of Sir William Butts, " Gulielmi Buttii," the
physician of Henry VIII.</p>
  <p>In the churchyard, besides the graves of the
Bishops, there are some interesting monuments.

  <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>
One in the south-east corner is decorated with the
insignia of a lord mayor, and, though sadly neglected, covers the founder of the Child family and
the first possessor of Osterley Park. Near it is what
we are disposed to consider one of the two oldest
relics remaining at Fulham, either in the Manor
House or the church; this is a brick archway in
the wall, and a door which formerly led towards
the Thames, but by the accumulation of centuries
it is now buried more than half its original height.
A similar doorway is in the garden wall, and has
over it the arms of Bishop FitzJames. A pleasant
aisle of limes arching overhead conducts the visitor
from the church to the street past the handsome
row of almshouses and the vicarage; or if he turn
his back on these it will lead him to the river side
and the Bishop's Walk, along the moat and gardens
past the house, and so back to the entrance; while
overhead the rooks caw in the trees in which their
forefathers built when the place received its name
of the Fowls' Home, a thousand years ago or more.</p>

shall be able to trace at a glance the progress of an




    <pb id="p.179" n="179"/>

Archbishop from his town house to the seat of the
Metropolitan see, passing in order by the manor
houses or granges at Croydon, Otford, Knole, Maidstone, and Charing. The greatest distance for one
stage is that from Croydon to Otford; and.a long
rest seems usually to have been made there, or in
the immediate neighbourhood. Three miles from
Otford to the east was Wrotham, two miles to the
south was Knole; but Wrotham and Knole did not
exist together as archiepiscopal residences. Wrotham was pulled down before <date value="1366">1366</date>, and Knole built
after <date value="1456">1456</date>; but a third seat was then a short way
off-Mayfield, which lay between Sevenoaks and
Tunbridge.</p>
  <p>Of all these so-called palaces but one remains
entire. Yet Knole owes its preservation to no unusual train of circumstances. It has passed through
the same vicissitudes of ownership as the others,-
has been granted and regranted by the Crown, leased
to irresponsible tenants, sold by spendthrifts, visited
by Puritan commissioners, and even partially burnt;
but it still exists, and seems likely to exist for ages
to come, one of the most interesting and perfect
examples of an ancient English residence which our
country possesses. The walls are substantially as
they were left by the Archbishops, patched in places
and adapted, but in reality little altered; and
although few of the rooms are in exactly their original condition, enough remains to satisfy the most
ardent investigator.  Situated little more than







<pb id="p.180" n="180"/>

twenty miles from London, in the centre of one of
the noblest parks in England, surrounded by much
of the best scenery in Kent, a morning's drive from
Maidstone or Tunbridge Wells, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the convenient little country
town of Sevenoaks, it has long been a favourite with
sightseers and picnic parties, and has also had more
than its share of antiquarian visitors and such
gatherings as that which a short time ago filled the
hall and courts at the annual meeting of the Kent
Archaeological Society.</p>
  <p>Trains run to Sevenoaks in about an hour, at
frequent intervals throughout the day, from Ludgate-hill, <placeName key="Charing-cross">Charing-cross</placeName>, and Victoria. Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays, on which Knole is
shown, bring the greatest crowds; but as the park
is always open and the outside of the house nearly
as interesting as the interior, every summer day
has its scores of visitors. The long hill up from
the railway station is rather trying in the sun, but
a <soCalled>'bus,</soCalled> in the shape of a superannuated carriage,
conveys us to the park-gate for an almost nominal
sum. Entering the pleasant little town from the
north-west, the secret of its unrivalled healthiness
is at once apparent; for not only is it placed 500
feet above the sea level, but upon a deep stratum of
porous sandstone. One or two <soCalled>half-timbered</soCalled>
houses catch the eye, an Elizabethan bay window
on the right, and a couple of red brick buildings of
Queen Anne's time on the left, whilst, opposite the





 <pb id="p.181" n="181"/>

fine Perpendicular church with its lofty tower, a
modest swing-gate gives admittance to Knole. We
descend a pleasant sandy avenue between high
banks crowned with trees and higher walls, over
which roses and ivy peep alternately, and, passing
a second gate, enter the park. Long reaches of
valley stretch right and left, dotted here and there
on the green slopes with bright-hued parties of
pleasure, or banner-bearing Sunday-schools from
the far city, distributed in groups; while immediately before us rises a bank of the richest foliage,
pierced below by the yellow avenue which leads to
the house. Entering the wood and turning slightly
toward the right, a paved way, which may have
echoed often to the footstep of some ambling mule,
bearing the sacred person of an Archbishop, mounts
the hill, and emerging from the shade displays at
one view the north front of the venerable house, its
quaint gables and frowning entrance tower, partly
hidden by the dark sycamores of which Walpole
was so enamoured a hundred years ago or more.</p>
  <p>Before applying for admission at the wicket we
resolve on a walk round the exterior, little thinking
what a journey is before us. Turning along the
front towards the east, and descending a slope, we
are opposite the arched gateway of the stable court.
Two or three pointed windows, now built up, are in
a gable above, and the vast barn of the Archbishops
to the left of the gateway. We pass under its great
walls, the buttresses standing out like the ribs of a





<pb id="p.182" n="182"/>

giant skeleton, and turn to the south; the house,
bristling with chimneys, and looking more like a
whole village than one residence, being on the right;
and on the left the open park, bounded apparently
at the horizon by the blue line of hills, at whose
feet nestle Otford and Wrotham, with their smaller
share of archiepiscopal remains. Centenary and
bi-centenary oaks, whole avenues of them, acres of
fern, sprinkled here and there with birch, beeches
which rival Burnham, lawns of smooth sward which
has never been disturbed since the making of the
world, fitly ornamented with herds of deer,-to all
these and many other beauties we turn an antiquarian cold shoulder, and entering a narrow passage
between two walls, find ourselves in the Wood Court.
It is bounded on one side by the house itself, on the
others by offices, which include a gaol for the proper
correction of the numerous servants of so vast an
establishment. From a stand-point on the grass-
plot in the centre may be seen specimens of every
style of architecture which has prevailed in England
for four centuries at least. Looking with our faces
towards the west, we have on the extreme right the
fine square towers of the first Archbishop, towards
the centre the roof of the vast kitchen, the quaint
double staircase, and the innumerable little gables
of various offices, brewhouses, bakehouses, and sculleries. Further towards the left, Stuart work begins
to show itself-and one great three-light window
bears the unmistakeable impress of the classical taste





<pb id="p.183" n="183"/>

which prevailed when George III. was king. Here
and there over the square Gothic battlements peep
Elizabethan gables; while some of the stone mullioned windows have been removed bodily, and their
place supplied with the plate-glass and sashes of
the reign of Queen Victoria. Leaving this museum
of architecture reluctantly, we continue our circumambulation. A wall shuts in the  <soCalled>pleasaunce</soCalled>
which lies on the south and west sides of the house;
but threading our way through a long avenue of
beeches we reach the hill-top, when the wall, nowhere very high, suddenly ceases, and an open-work
fence allows a glance at the paradise within: trim
yew hedges, bordering trimmer walks; dark thickets
of evergreens, groves of roses, smooth clipped lawns
of turf, here and there an antique statue,-all these
things pass for a moment before the eye. Then,
crossing the south side of this inner park (for it is
no less), and having paused awhile to inspect some
ancient hollow trees, and to take a long look down
a grassy avenue at the yellow gables of the south
front and the grey stonework below on which they
stand, while visions of scarlet cardinals and blackrobed priests seem to pass in and out of the pointed
doorway in the centre, we hurry on, and reaching
the west side, skirt the garden by another avenue of
beeches,-with a view here and there of the Sevenoaks Church tower on one hand, and an occasional
vista, closed by the ivy-coloured towers of the house,
on the other,-and emerge at length from a thicket





<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>

of beeches, opposite the great gate again, and under
the shadow of the dark sycamores. After a few
moments' rest on an inviting seat, and a short application to Murray and a note-book, we approach
the gate and knock at the wicket. The knocker
alone is worth coming to see; it resembles an iron
boot-jack, and is but badly calculated for double
knocks.</p>
  <p>The entrance gateway which admits to the Green
Court is part of the work of Archbishop Bourchier.
The roof is not vaulted, but there are indications of
its age in the chambers above. Two sides at least
of the court itself are of the same antiquity; but
a wall formerly stretched right and left from the
gate, where now a picturesque row of gables
forms one of the most characteristic features of
the place. Over this wall, and from the windows
of the tower above, the warders watched for the
coming of the Cardinal Morton from Otford in
October, <date value="1500">1500</date>. It requires little imagination to
picture to oneself the long procession of horses and
sumpter-mules, of soldiers and priests, of servants
and pages, winding through the autumn trees, while
in their midst a cross of silver is borne before the
litter in which the Archbishop lies racked with an
ague, caught in the marshes at Otford. He comes
to Knole to die, but his place is speedily filled.</p>
  <p>Facing us is another noble gate-tower, flanked on
either side by a series of bay windows surmounted
by battlements. The flattened arch of this inner




  <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>

gateway supports a noble oriel, the upper part of
which is curiously fitted to the machicolations, so
as to give at first sight the impression that the
window is later than the tower itself. This idea is
dissipated by an examination of the masonry. The
oriel lights a fine chamber not usually shown to
visitors, and now a nursery, in which the corbels
of an arched roof yet remain. They are carved
with the device of Archbishop Bourchier, by whom
the estate had been purchased in <date value="1456">1456</date>; and in a
little compartment of stained glass in the head of
the window occurs the <quote>falcon vulned in the wings</quote>
which was one of the supporters of his paternal
shield. But the ceiling is now flat and white-
washed; for in <date value="1745">1745</date> the louvre which bore the
clock over the great hall began to sink, and the clock
was moved hither and placed in a curious upper
story of the kind of Gothic to be expected from the
date; while the pointed roof of the Archbishop's
chamber had to make way for the pendulum and
weights. The arched gate below is vaulted, and
leads to the Stone Court, which seems older than
the guide-books make it. It is generally dated from
the water-pipes of the roof, which bear the name
and arms of the <soCalled>poet</soCalled> Earl of Dorset, <date value="1605">1605</date>; but
a few minutes' examination of the stonework suffices
to show that the leadwork was added long after the
court itself was built. A colonnade worthy of William
III. and Hampton Court faces the gateway, and gives
entrance to the great hall. The hall blazes with




<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>

heraldry, and the gallery and roof are of the seventeenth century; but the lower walls are of the Archbishop's time, and under the gallery are still to be
seen doors which led to the kitchen when the
kitchen was nearly twice its present length, and was
supplied with three or four fireplaces at the least.
The dais remains in the hall, but it is occupied by a
statue of Demosthenes, and the eye seeks in vain
for any sign of the merry doings of old days. The
Commonwealth had not left the old house untouched, nor the loyal family which owned it: smart
fines had the Sackvilles to pay for their loyalty, and
not only fines but banishment, like other great nobles
of the time; but in the garrets are still to be seen
the vast brass-studded trunks which tell by the date
<date value="1660">1660</date>, in nails on their lids, of a great coming home
when the King received his own again, and the Earl
returned to Knole. Those were the prosperous days
of the hall. A hundred retainers feasted before
their lord, from <quote>Mr. Mathew Caldecott, my lord's
favourite,</quote> to <quote>Thomas Marockoe, a blackamoor.</quote>
But this same hall saw a different sight in the
spring of <date value="1815">1815</date>, when the body of the young Duke,
the sole hope of the house, just come of age, was
brought home from Ireland to lie here in state on
its way to the sepulchre of his fathers at Withyham,
in Sussex. Old men still employed at Knole remember that homecoming,-the hall draped in black, the
hatchments, the feathers, the hearse, the mother
weeping for the untimely end of her only son, who





                                        <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>

had gone forth in the morning full of strength, and
was borne back at evening shattered and senseless.</p>
  <p>Of the wonders of the interior much has been
said and may be said. A very full account is in all
the guide-books, both of the furniture and the
pictures. There is no need to go through the lists
here, but a few things may be noted. The Long
Gallery, which is now hung with four copies of
Raphael's cartoons, was formerly decorated with
beautiful tapestry, which still remains on the other
side of the wall in a corridor not shown to
visitors. The Cartoon Gallery is ninety feet long
and looks low, though it is fifteen feet high. There
is fine tapestry also to be seen in the Organ Room
and the Chapel, but the best is in a room called the
Venetian Bedroom, said to have been fitted up for
the reception of Niccolo Molina, the Venetian ambassador; while another authority states that
James II. slept in it, which seems probable, as his
monogram is on the bed. The tapestry bears the
name of "Franciscus Springius," who was probably
a Flemish manufacturer, and deserves to be better
known to posterity. But the history of tapestry as
a fine art has yet to be written. Another charming room is known as Lady Betty Germaine's, where
in addition to many objects worth observing, such
as a Persian table-cover, a beautifully designed door
key, and some heraldic window-glass, we must not
fail to notice the Mortlake tapestry, and the portraits worked on it of Vandyke, the painter, and





<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>

another character, said by some to be Crane, by
whom the Mortlake works were established, and by
others, Lord Gowrie, the father-in-law of Vandyke.
But no enumeration of pictures or furniture gives
any idea of the subtle charm of visiting a house like
this. The visitor can hardly keep his attention alive
to the explanations of the attendant: he finds himself absently speculating at every step on the scenes
which some of these old portraits have looked down
upon, in which some of their originals have taken
part. His eye is constantly strained in the vague
hope of seeing a ghostly bishop, or a tight-vested
Elizabethan, or a powdered belle in brocaded sack
cross the further end of each long gallery, or hastily
disappear through a distant door. Artists are copying pictures, or composing new ones in some of the
rooms; architects studying the ceilings or the furniture in others; and when by virtue of a special
pass we ascend to the garrets, more are found at work
even there, and we are pleased to acknowledge a liberality which makes so much treasure available for
art. The chapel, the chaplain's room, with <foreign lang="LA">BENEDICTUS DEUS</foreign> on the stone mantelpiece, the tapestry,
the crypt, the picturesque little courts, the mysterious windows which seem to belong to no room of
the interior, the turfed and terraced garden, all and
each might be treated of; but at last, dizzy with
ascending and descending even a tithe of the eighty
staircases, of threading his way through lonely and
interminable attic galleries, with here and there a





                                         <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>

sudden peep into a flowery garden, or a court glowing with the summer sunshine, the traveller gladly
finds himself again under the Archbishop's oriel,
and remarks, with the eye more of a moralist than
a critic, that the gladiator which adorns the centre
of a grass-plot has the arms of the Sackvilles on his
shield, and the motto, Honi soit qui mal y pense.
He probably accepts the words, and making up his
mind that in such a place no anachronism seems
more absurd than that he should visit it in the nineteenth century, betakes himself through the sunset
and the trees to the little town, the railway station,
and the great modern city.</p>

   <p>THE virtues of the Vicar of Bray, whose
            consistent life is celebrated in a well-
       known song, were emulated, if not surpassed, by those of Sir William Petre.
This worthy seems to have been able to swallow
any oaths imposed by Tudor tyranny, to have made
up his mind to keep his place whatever king or
queen might reign, and to have resolved, if possible,
to be honest, but in any case to be rich. In an age
when men were burned for the turning of a sentence,
and hanged for a misinterpreted exclamation, and
when it seems to us as if no one who had any mind
of his own could follow the dictates of conscience,
the dictates of parliament, and the dictates of self-
interest at the same time, it is wonderful and
nothing less to find Sir William Petre serving
Wolsey and Henry, Somerset and Northumberland,
Mary and Elizabeth, successively, without incurring
half a dozen attainders at least. Nine lives, if he
had them, might have been jeopardied in the effort.
Yet he succeeded, and we can only conclude that he
knew how to be silent when others spoke, how to
<figure id="Fig.020" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.023.DO01.00020"><head>INGATESTONE HALL.</head></figure>





                                <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>

refrain when others declared, how to wait when
others hastened. As if to add to the difficulties
which surrounded him, the very nature of his
possessions brought him into direct contact with
the Pope himself, and in <date value="1555">1555</date> he received a bull
from Paul IV. in which he was specially authorised
to keep the estates which had been granted to him
or which he had purchased, and which had formerly
belonged to the monasteries that he had taken so
large a part in destroying.  It is said that he
obtained this bull on the tacit understanding that
by preserving the estates himself, he might be
the better able to endow afresh the despoiled
abbeys, but this was the voice of scandal. It is
only certain that he retained the lands, that the
monasteries were never restored, and that an
almshouse, which is now the first old building
we see as we leave Ingatestone station, was,
apparently, the only institution he ever endowed.
Nor did he in this case exceed his habitual prudence, for, considering the immense revenues he
received from conventual estates, the petty sum of
&#x00A3;90 13s. 4d. annually was a moderate income to
assign to it.</p>
  <p>The almshouses were originally in the track of
the railway, and were removed to their present site
and rebuilt by the late Lord Petre. Sir William's
endowment does not seem very magnificent, but we
must remember that he also founded eight fellowships at Exeter College, Oxford.</p>






<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>

  <p>He, moreover, added considerably to the parish
church, chiefly in chapels for his family, and his
initials appear in the brickwork on one of the
gables. A magnificent altar-tomb, on which he lies
in full armour by the side of his second wife, may
still be seen in the chancel. He died full of years
and honours in <date value="1571">1571</date>, and his son obtained in the
first year of James I. the peerage still enjoyed by
his descendants. The Lords Petre have shown in
successive centuries a different kind of consistency
from any displayed by the founder of their fortunes, and are still reckoned among the so-called
<soCalled>Catholic</soCalled> houses which have adhered to the faith

<pb id="p.193" n="193"/>

of the ages before the Reformation. A Romanist
chapel is still a prominent feature of the buildings
at Ingatestone Hall, and a little colony of that persuasion is maintained under the shelter of the
house which Sir William built.</p>
  <p>Ingatestone Hall is not what it was, yet few more
picturesque examples of Tudor architecture remain
in England. Leaving the station, which is about
twenty miles from London, by a road down hill to
the south, we pass a modern lodge, and enter what
was once a quadrangle through an old archway.
The tall and ancient trees set off with most harmonious greens a red brick court, clad here and
there in ivy, and boasting at one side the finest
Westeria, perhaps, in England. The old hall is
now divided into separate tenements, in one of
which is the residence of a priest, and in another
that of the land agent of the Petre estate. In the
centre is a modern-looking porch, supported on
classical columns, by which entrance is given to the
chapel, the eastern end of which has recently been
extended by the addition of an apse, and a bell
turret. An ancient turret is in the corer of the
court, and windows filled with armorial glass peep
out here and there from under the ivy. The red
brick of the sixteenth century is patched in many
places with modern building; lofty roofs of tile, and
dormer windows of the utmost quaintness, rise high
above; chimneys of many shafts tower over the
gables, and the waters of a pond reflect the various






<pb id="p.194" n="194"/>

hues of red and brown in their sombre depths, and
are bordered by an avenue of limes on the other
side, from which the most charming views of the
old house may be obtained.</p>
  <p>Our visit was in summer, when the fresh green
leaves seemed almost out of place beside the ancient
buildings, but the air of seclusion and even of sadness, which pervaded the old hall, was not dissipated
by the glowing sunshine. No great effort of the
imagination was required to people the grassy slope
with courtiers and ladies in the gorgeous costumes
of three centuries ago, or to see peeping from the
mullioned lattices heads covered with velvet and
feathers, though the roar and whistle of a passing
train speedily recalled us from the silent past to
the bustling present. A modern novelist has laid
the scene of a sensational novel at Ingatestone Hall;
and, in truth, no more appropriate situation can
anywhere be found for a picture requiring decayed
splendour and gloomy magnificence for a background.</p>
  <p>The residence to which access is obtained through
a modern door in the ivy-clad turret contains some
fine tapestry: Noah and his family entering the
ark; Moses as an infant pulling off Pharaoh's crown,
while the King stoops to caress him; the murder
of the oppressor of his brethren; the Golden Calf
in Horeb; and the breaking of the Two Tables,-
many such scenes may be made out in one room;
in another, we see the Espousals of Joseph and






                                 <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>

Mary, and the Adoration of the Magi. In this last
picture a long procession of knights and attendants
with richly-caparisoned horses and camels wind
along the road in the back-ground, and the view is
such as might have been presented in the sixteenth century by the neighbourhood of Ingatestone.</p>
  <p>But perhaps the most curious part of the house
is a priest's hiding-place, which was discovered in
<date value="1855">1855</date> to be in one of the projections of the south
side. Its entrance is in a small room on the middle
floor, where a trap about two feet square admits by
a ladder to a little chamber about fourteen feet long
by two feet wide and ten high. It is on the level of
the ground, and in the sand of which the floor is
composed chicken bones were found, the remains
probably of some food secretly supplied to an occupant. A curious trunk or chest was discovered at
the same time. It had, no doubt, been used for
storing the Altar furniture and other necessaries for
the secret celebration of mass. It is strange that
all knowledge of this hiding-place had died out. A
packing-case addressed to one Lady Petre in old
writing was found in the dungeon, and must have
lain there nearly a hundred years. It was about a
century ago that the family finally left Ingatestone,
and in the interval all memory of the mysterious
closet had faded away.</p>
  <p>Ingatestone Hall was once a grange or summer
residence of the Abbess of Barking. Some parts



<pb id="p.196" n="196"/>

of it, therefore, may be older than the time of Sir
William. It must have originally been a double
square. But only three sides of one court and the
gateway, much modernised, now remain. The barn,
and perhaps some of the adjoining buildings, look
even older than the house, and were probably erected
to contain the tithes and rents in kind received by
the abbess. The collector paid annually for the
manor the sum of xlviij s. to the Cellaress of the
Abbey.</p>
  <p>The little town of Ingatestone is said to derive
its name from one of the miliary stones of a Roman
road, which here passed by on its way to Colchester.
Roman brick is built into the rubble walls of the
church, and Roman remains have been found in the
immediate neighbourhood. The Red Lion Inn, in
the village street, is still pointed out as the place
where the milestone once stood: and in ancient
documents the place is spoken of in Latin as <quote>Ing
ad Petram,</quote> the meadow by the stone. It is also
sometimes named Ing Abbess, from the nunnery of
Barking, to which it belonged, until Henry VIII.,
having taken possession, sold it to Sir William
Petre for &#x00A3;849 12s. 6d. Twelve other manors are
named in the papal bull of which mention has
already been made, but this one had belonged to
Barking Abbey from time immemorial, and is spoken
of in the Domesday Survey as being held ever by
St. Mary, <quote>Semper Sancta Maria.</quote> The name of
the adjoining parish of Butsbury is given in old
                                <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>

deeds  as  <quote>Ging-Joyberd,</quote> or <quote>Yng-Joyberd,</quote>
pointing to another <quote>Ing</quote> or pasture in the possession of an individual or family called <quote>Joyberd.</quote>
The surname is not yet unknown in Essex. Another
parish close by is Margaretting, or St. Margaret's
Ing, and a third bears a family name, as Mountney's Ing, or Mountnessing.</p>
  <p>The tall red tower of the parish church is a conspicuous object in every view of Ingatestone. Its
beauty makes us wish modern Gothic architects
were not so devoted to stone for their towers.
A very good view of it is given in Buckler's
Churches of Essex, in which also there is a sketch
of part of the hall, and some account of the interior.
The church tower dates from the fifteenth century,
and contains more than half a million bricks. A
projection on the south side contains the staircase
to the roof. It is of the winding sort, and is made
of large bricks. In the chamber above, there are
five bells, dated respectively <date value="1610">1610</date>, <date value="1660">1660</date>, <date value="1701">1701</date>, and
two in <date value="1758">1758</date>. One of these last bears a quaint inscription:-
        <quote rend="blockquote">The founder he has played his part,
        <lb/>Which shows him master of his art.
          <lb/>So hang me well and ring me true,
          <lb/>And I will sound your praises due.</quote>
The interior of the church is spacious and light. It
has been recently <soCalled>restored,</soCalled> and, strange to say,
is not much, if at all the worse. In the chancel,
at the south side, is the tomb of Sir William Petre,





<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>

of which mention has already been made. Near it
is a tablet to the memory of his brother, Robert,
which tells us that he was Receiver of the Exchequer
to the <quote>moste famous Queen Eliza.</quote> In the north
chapel, which serves as a vestry-room, are several
tombs; and below, in a vault, twenty coffins are
laid side by side. The Petres now bury their dead
at Thorndon, where a beautiful mortuary chapel
has been erected. Among the monuments here at
Ingatestone is one to the memory of John, the first
Lord Petre, an immense structure of the time of
Charles I. It contains, under a classical colonnade,
statues of the baron and his wife, as well as of the
second Lord and his wife. The epitaph, which we
may presume was composed by the second Lord, is
in Latin, very long, and concluding thus, <quote>William,
Lord Petre, his inconsolable son, who inherits his
estate (I wish I could say his virtues), erected this
monument to the memory of so deserving a father.</quote>
And the epitaph on Catherine, Lady Petre, the said
Lord William's wife, is equally quaint. It sets
forth her goodness, and goes on to say that <quote>being
more desirous of a mansion in the skies, than of a
longer life, she departed (migravit) on the 30th
October, <date value="1624">1624</date>, aged 49. It is a question whether
she was most worthy of heaven or of earth (<foreign lang="LA">coelone
dignior an mundo lis est</foreign>).</quote></p>

     <p>TRAVELLERS on the London and North-
  Western Railway may observe, shortly
          after emerging from the great cuttings and
          the tunnel at Boxmoor, a thick wood on
the right of the line and facing the long straggling
town which occupies a slope on the left. The
town is Berkhamsted, or as it is sometimes spelt,
Berkhampstead; indeed some fifty other ways of
spelling the name are given in Mr. Cobbe's History
and Antiquities of Berkhamsted. Just as we pass
the railway-station, two fragments of a double wall
standing parallel to each other near the edge of the
wood catch the eye for a moment. In another
moment the wood is out of sight, and the open
country, pleasantly undulating, extends to a distant
horizon on both sides. But those two little fragments
of flint masonry have a history worth pausing over.
They have their place even in the history of the
nation. To keep the passage between them was
once a charge worthy of the greatest subject in the
realm. Through the gateway whose place they
mark, in peace or war many a noble procession has





<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>

passed. They admitted in turn, John of England,
and Louis of France; John of France and
Richard King of the Romans. Here the Black
Prince lived, and here, in the days of his son,
<persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName> was clerk of the works. Froissart was
here with the Queen in <date value="1361">1361</date>. But all the glory is
now departed; except the site, little is left, and it
looks to-day probably much as it did when, in <date value="1087">1087</date>,
Robert of Mortaigne came at the Conqueror's bidding to build the castle. The earthworks and the
mound were there then as they are now, but hardly
anything beside, unless some wooden sheds for the
shelter of the soldiers. At what date the mound
was made, and the ditches were first opened, it is not
possible to say. When the Conqueror came they
were there, and his coming is perhaps the first
authentic event in the history of Berkhamsted, unless we accept it as the scene of St. Brithwald's
Council in <date value="697">697</date>, and not rather Birsted near Maidstone, or Brasted near Sevenoaks. But if authentic
history is silent, tradition is not. St. Paul was here
when he had journeyed into Spain, and, according
to the same authority, he signalised his visit by an
act of exorcism similar to that, some three centuries
later, performed by St. Patrick in Ireland. Both
serpents and lightning have visited the parish since,
and seem to regard the exorcism from the sceptical
point of view which seems now generally appropriate to the pleasant fables of local tradition. We
only know that before the Conquest, Berkhamsted





                               <pb id="p.201" n="201"/>

was a place of importance,-perhaps on account of
its military position; and because, as Mr. Clark
pointed out to the Archaeological Institute during
their recent visit, it is one link of a complete chain
of fortresses, which surrounded and guarded the
valley of the Thames. Though it had previously
been inhabited, and possibly strengthened, by the
Kings of Mercia, and afterwards by the successors
of Alfred, it owes its first regular fortification to
William, whose military genius recognised it as one
of the series of which Rochester, Guildford, Farnham, Windsor, and Wallingford were the other
members. He was here before he reached London,
and, as we have seen, he probably found here
already the cone on which the keep of his castle
was to rise, as similar cones had been found and
turned to account at four out of five of the other
places. In some respects the Berkhamsted keep
may   have resembled  that of Windsor, being
surrounded by a moat of its own, partly within
the moat of the whole fortress and partly conterminous with it. The mound was used to support a hollow shell of masonry, as at Cardiff, but
only the saucer-like configuration of the summit
now remains to indicate its existence. And all
the rest of the buildings which made up the Castle
have shared the fate of the keep. There was
once a chapel near the foot of the mound, one
of three with which the Castle was sanctified.
Of it there only remains a broken candlestick,






<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>

discovered lately on the site. The two decaying
walls near the railway station are all that is left
of the entrance gateway, and a key dug up when
the road was made all that is tangible of the gate
itself.</p>
  <p>Whether the builder of Berkhamsted Castle was
ever Earl of Cornwall, is more a matter of nomenclature than of actual historical question; but it is
certain that from his time the Castle has followed
the fortunes of the Earls and Dukes of Cornwall.
The Prince of Wales now owns it. To the first
duke, better known as the Black Prince, it was a
favourite residence; here, in <date value="1361">1361</date>, he took his last
leave of his mother, when Froissart was told of the
prophecy of Merlin that the crown would never
rest on the heads of Edward or the next prince,
Lionel, but descend to the son of the third brother
John. While living at Berkhamsted, before the sad
days which closed his father's glorious reign, he fell
ill, and when but half recovered set out from here
to meet the Parliament at Westminster, only a few
days before his death. Of older memories than
these, the Castle has no lack. We may choose
between such names as those of the FitzPiers and
the Mandevilles, Lords of Berkhamsted; of <persName key="Thomas
a Becket">Thomas
Becket</persName>, sometime its custodian; of King John,
who granted the town its first charter; of Louis of
France, his siege of the Castle, and the fruitless
bravery displayed by the defenders; but the two
most interesting names in the list of its occupants





                                 <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

are perhaps those of Richard King of the Romans,
and of Cicely Duchess of York.</p>
  <p>Richard seems in a kind of way to have succeeded
to the title which his father had sometime borne.
As Earl of Cornwall, he lived much at Berkhamsted.
From it he set out on his expeditions, first to the
Holy Land, and afterwards on a scarcely less unreal
errand: this was to Germany, in quest of the
crown of the Romans, which, when he had lavished
much of the treasure gathered from the English
Jews, he obtained in <date value="1257">1257</date>. As King of the Romans,
he lived and died here; and here he brought successively his three wives. The first was one of the
co-heiresses of the Marshalls, Earls of Pembroke,
and the widow of Gilbert de Clare. She died in
child-bed at Berkhamsted, and perhaps it was owing
to his grief that he assumed the cross. On his
return, after three years' widowhood, he married
Sanchia, one of the four queens, daughters of Raymond, Count of Provence. After sixteen years'
exile from the sunny skies of her native land, she
too died at Berkhamsted, having lost all her children
successively except one, Edmund, who survived his
father but eventually died childless. The King's
third wife was perhaps better suited to the climate
of Hertfordshire. According to most accounts, she
was the niece of Archbishop Conrad, of Cologne,
and she survived her husband. In April <date value="1272">1272</date>, the
body of Richard, King of the Romans, Count of
Poictou, and Earl of Cornwall, was carried from





<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>

Berkhamsted to Hales Abbey for interment, and
his heart to the church of the Friars Minor
at Oxford. In <date value="1300">1300</date>, his only son died, and the
county of Cornwall, with the castle of Berkhamsted, reverted to the Crown. Edward I. made it
the dower of his second wife, and is further posthumously connected with the place, because one of
the letters of Edward III., dated from this castle,
relates to the renewal of the cerecloth of his grandfather,-<quote><foreign lang="LA">de cera renovanda circa corpus Edwardi
Primi.</foreign></quote> Six picked men from Berkhamsted served
at Crecy, but this reign is signalised in the annals
of the town by an event of a different character. In
<date value="1291">1291</date>, John of Berkhamsted, a native, was elected
Abbot of St. Albans. During his rule it was that
the remains of Queen Elinor rested at St. Albans
on their long journey from <soCalled>Herdeby</soCalled> to Westminster, and he was the Abbot who, in <date value="1295">1295</date>, succeeded in obtaining for the clergy protection from
the additional taxes levied to support the King's
wars. Of Abbot John we shall have occasion to
speak more at length in our chapter on St. Albans.</p>
  <p>Under Edward III., the Castle attained its
greatest splendour, or rather under his son the
Black Prince, of whose tenure of it we have already
spoken. Richard II. gave it to his favourite Vere,
but on his attainder it returned to the Crown.
Edward IV. gave the town a fresh charter, which
was of more real importance to the inhabitants than
even the presence of <persName key="Chaucer, Geoffrey">Chaucer</persName> and Froissart. It is





                                 <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

not many years since the exemption of the tradesmen from serving on juries was acknowledged by
the law courts, in accordance with the privileges of
this charter. And thus we reach the name of the
King's mother, the last and one of the greatest of
the denizens of the Castle. This was Cicely,
Duchess of York, the daughter of the head of the
Nevilles, the niece of Henry IV., the aunt of the
King-maker, sister of five peers of the realm,
mother of two kings, and for many years the
greatest lady in the land. <soCalled>Proud Cis</soCalled> has passed
into a proverb, and no one can wonder if she was
proud. Whether she was or not, one thing is certain: she was a woman of sufficient talent to keep
her high position all her life, and of sufficient
strength to survive the misfortunes which in those
days seemed appropriate to high rank. Her husband,
her brother, and her second son, all perished after
the fatal field of Wakefield; yet she survived to see
another son put to death by his own brother, and a
third slain in battle. She outlived Bosworth nearly
eleven years. Before her death she saw her eldest
son's heiress on the throne, and the young Henry-
who after bearing for a time the title which had been
her husband's, was destined to extinguish in the blood
of her granddaughter the last fading glimmer of the
great Plantagenet name-had reached the age of
five years. She lived and regulated her household,
at Berkhamsted, until <date value="1496">1496</date>, when, after seeing her
granddaughter's husband put her grandson to death,





<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>

and her daughter take up the cause of an impostor,
she died, full of honours and of all the attendants of
honour, after a life which, viewed in the perspective
of four centuries, appears, according to the light
turned upon it, either such a long tragedy, or else
such a course of prosperity, as is unexampled in
our annals.</p>
  <p>After her death the Castle fell to decay, and her
descendant Queen Elizabeth granted it, at the
annual rent of a red rose to be paid on the feast
of St. John the Baptist, to Sir Edward Carey, the
father of the first Lord Falkland, and cousin of the
Queen's cousin Henry Carey, Lord Hunsdon. It
was already ruined, as Leland describes it, and
when Sir Edward built the house on the hill just
above it, the old walls no doubt formed a convenient
quarry for the supply of building stone.</p>
  <p>After it had thus mounted the hill piecemeal its
connection with great folk and great events continued as before the translation. Here Lucius,
Lord Falkland, spent much of his boyhood; and
when the Careys ceased to live here the house was
occupied by some of the household of James I.
Prince Charles was here in <date value="1616">1616</date>, and as Duke of
Cornwall obtained from his father a charter for the
town by which its privileges were enlarged and a
bailiff and burgesses appointed. Camden granted
the corporation a coat of arms, in which the Castle
figures prominently <quote>within a border of Cornewall,
viz. Sables, bezanted.</quote> But after lasting less than





                                 <pb id="p.207" n="207"/>

fifty years, the trouble of electing and sustaining a
corporation grew too great for the sleepy little town,
and though they still claim some of their privileges,
as we have seen, the charter has long been a dead
letter to the burgesses of Berkhamsted. Under the
Commonwealth, the house which had succeeded the
Castle was again prominent. During the Protectorate it was occupied by Colonel Axtel, the Regicide;
after the Restoration, by Weston, Earl of Portland,
the Chancellor, in whose day the greater part of it
was destroyed by fire. In its reduced state it was
rented by John Sayer, who, as his epitaph in the
church informs us, had been "Archimagirus," or
chief-cook, to Charles II. It still belongs to the
Duchy of Cornwall, and is now under a lease,
with the Castle, or its site in the valley below,
to the owner of the neighbouring park of Ashridge.</p>
  <p>The Castle and its successive occupants have left
less mark upon the church of Berkhamsted than
might have been expected. None of the royal and
princely folk seem to have selected it as a burialplace, and the only monuments which connect it
with the Castle are those of King Charles's cook, as
already mentioned, and of Robert Incent, <quote>late
s'vant unto the noble princesse lady Cecyle duchesse
of Yorke, and mother unto the worthy King Edward
the IIII and Richard the thyrde, whych sayd Robert
Incent dyed of the grete swetyng sykenesse the first
yere of the Reygne of King Henry the VII.</quote> Dean





<pb id="p.208" n="208"/>

Incent was his son, and founded the Grammar-
school in <date value="1541">1541</date>; dying in <date value="1545">1545</date>, he was buried in
the church, but his monument is no longer extant.
The name of Incent or Innocent still lingers in the
parish, and the quaint arms of the Dean are still
to be seen on stained glass in the Head-master's
parlour. They are alluded to in lines preserved
by Weever, but now no longer to be seen; and
the description, <quote>Argent, on a bend gules an
Innocent or,</quote> seems to mean an infant holding a
rose.</p>
  <p>The last event connecting Berkhamsted and
royalty seems to have been the residence here of

Peter the Wild Boy, which commenced about <date value="1730">1730</date> and lasted till his death in <date value="1785">1785</date>. The collar with

<quote>Peter the Wild man from Hanover. Whoever will
bring him to Mr. Fenn, at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, shall be paid for their trouble.</quote> But the
modern traveller will be more interested by another
and worthier association. In the Rectory House
was born, in <date value="1731">1731</date>, the great Christian poet, William
Cowper, and in the east window of the church,
recently filled with stained glass in honour of his
memory, we may see him depicted, and at his feet
the three tame hares which he immortalised.</p>

         <p>THE long reach of the chalk hills known
         as the North Downs enters Surrey near
            Guildford, and crossing the country
            from west to east, passes into Kent
between Tatsfield and Chevening.  It attains its
greatest width in Surrey, a little way south of Croydon. The railway here plunges into a long tunnel
and emerges high up among the downs, at an anonymous place from which the branch line diverges to
Caterham. Caterham itself is some five miles off
in a valley to the east.  A bleak down, crowned
with a Gothic asylum, of the most staring pattern,
its brick walls blushing crimson as if at their exposed situation, is on the right; while, straight on
along the line a glimpse may be obtained, between
two rounded banks of chalk, of the valley to the
south, inwhich Merstham, Gatton, and so many other
pleasant places are spread out in the summer sunshine. This valley lies between the two ranges: the
chalk on the north and the sand hills on the south.
We are in the heart of the chalk. A vast cliff close
to the Junction dazzles the eyes with its whiteness.






                         <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

The trees are all down in the valley, except a few
young firs which defy the east wind around the
asylum; and if it were not for the distant views of
Caterham on one side, and of the Merstham valley
on the other, the scene about the railway station
would be almost unbearable in its bleakness. Yet,
behind the unpromising front of the downs, something may be found worth the seeking. Each great
billow has a valley between it and its neighbour.
Five or six distinct waves of chalk may be counted
before the comparative flatness of the Merstham
district is reached. The inner life of these hills was
almost unknown till a few years ago.  The little
churches, hidden from the wind in wooded nooks;
the ancient houses, sometimes manors, sometimes
farms; the quiet parsonages, the great bare fields
with their scattered sheep, the sheltered valleys full
of corn, the wooden windmills crowning each hill,
had all a kind of independent existence apart from
the world, and so shut out from   the reach of
strangers that it was not until some fifteen years ago
that there were any roads in Chaldon, the parish
whose church is the principal object of interest in
our present excursion.</p>
  <p>The seclusion of Chaldon, great as it has been,
has not been so great that the church has escaped
restoration. Even to this corner of the earth have
the disciples of Sir Gilbert Scott penetrated. For
once their visit has been productive of good.
Perhaps it would be safer to say, partly in spite of







<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>

them has a great discovery been made and a real
restoration effected. The allegorical painting which
remains at Chaldon belongs to a series, and this
one only has been rescued.  The others, alas!
perished under the hands of the restorer before
assistance could arrive.</p>
  <p>An excursion to Chaldon and its surroundings
has several strong recommendations for the sightseer. It is within easy reach of London.  The
country is eminently healthful; more than sufficiently picturesque, full of antiquarian interest; and
withal so far unexplored that even "Murray," the ubiquitous, dismisses it in a sentence. He recommends
the visitor to approach from the north, and passing
Coulsdon to climb <quote>a steep hill to Chaldon Church,
a plain rural building of which the older portion is
E.E., but most part perp.  The church stands in
a secluded and picturesque nook, and all around
are tempting rambles.</quote>  So far the " Handbook."
But would it surprise the compiler to learn that the
church contains, in addition to <soCalled>E.E.</soCalled> and <soCalled>perp.,</soCalled>
examples also of Norman, Decorated, Elizabethan,
Stuart, and so on ?-and that a mile further on is
one of the finest views over the weald and the sand
hills that can be pointed out in the whole county ?
We say nothing of the painting, which was only
discovered two or three years ago.</p>
  <p>We disobey "Murray," however, in our excursion.
A return ticket to Merstham, a walk from Merstham
over the hills to Caterham Junction through Chaldon





                       <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>

and Coulsdon, and a <quote>tempting ramble</quote> through
the woods by the way,-this is our programme. Its
merits are chiefly these.  There are two or three
trains at Caterham Junction for one at Merstham.
We thus find ourselves able to return without too
long a delay at the station whenever we may arrive
there. Further, we visit the churches and chief
objects of interest while we are still fresh in the
early part of the walk; and, lastly, we have the sun
behind us on the hills, and not shining in our eyes,
a matter of no small importance in the glare of a
chalk district.</p>
  <p>Merstham Church will repay a visit. It is reached
from the railway station by the village street, and
a pretty walk through a kind of little glen, with a
rickety bridge over one of those mysterious ponds
which, connected in their history with the iron
trade of the middle ages, are yet more strangely
connected, geologically, with their famous neighbour, the burrowing Mole.  The church stands on
the first <soCalled>escarpment</soCalled> of the chalk.  A foretaste
of the view to be seen above may here be obtained
from the parapet of the wall on the south side of
the churchyard.  An Early English west door has
suffered restoration; but other specimens of the
same date remain untouched. A brass or two, a half
defaced recumbent figure, some handsome and tasteful modern monuments, a little bit of old stained
glass, and clerestory windows which, owing to the
roof of the side aisles having been raised, are within





<pb id="p.214" n="214"/>

the church, occupy a few minutes; and then, leaving
the churchyard at the eastern end, we commence to
climb the hill, passing on our way a great quarry
and a row of melancholy-looking workmen's houses.
The summit of the hill is soon reached, and immediately we are in a different region. Everything is
changed. Behind us in the valley, to the south and
west, village after village, orchard after orchard,
park after park, stretch away towards Redhill and
Reigate.  The sand hills are clothed with trees to
their summits, here and there church spires and
red-roofed villas rise against the sky line, while at
intervals a gap shows the Weald of Kent beyond,
and in the farthest distance the Sussex downs and
the blue line of hills in which Tunbridge Wells and
Frant are concealed. The view is worthy of Birket
Foster. Nay, one feels assured he must have studied
it already to his advantage.</p>
  <p>Turning our backs upon the valley we plunge into
the hills.  Here the scene is entirely different.  It
is not bleak, nor bare, nor ugly; but somehow it is
not so pleasing.  The wind seems always to blow,
the trees look as if they were all inclined one way:
the fields are very large, the houses very few and
very small.  But a pleasant lane among the cornfields, with elms almost meeting overhead, and then
a breezy common, covered with furze and heather,
then a path through a ploughed field, bristling with
flints, then a steep ascent along a dark wood into
which the pheasants run as leisurely as if the





                       <pb id="p.215" n="215"/>

<soCalled>First</soCalled> will not be for months to come, and the
top of another hill is reached, and Chaldon Church,
with its spire, just shows itself among the trees in
front. At the foot of a green lawn dotted with elms
is the rectory; a little to the left is an old farmhouse, formerly the <soCalled>Court;</soCalled> woods and cornfields interspersed form the background of a circumscribed but pretty landscape; the air of retirement
and the absolute stillness being in a kind of negative way the most striking features.  A dog at the
the farm, dozing in the sun on the top of his kennel,
begins to bark at sound of footsteps: the sudden
noise is almost painful to the ear, but the profound
stillness, once broken, is not to be recalled. The
visitor leaves his musings, and rousing himself to
obtain the keys, enters the churchyard and the
church.</p>
  <p>I have brought with me a very elaborate and interesting paper, which Mr. J. G. Waller read for the
Surrey Archaeological Society some years ago. It
relates to the then recently discovered painting on
the west wall of Chaldon Church. Mr. Waller's
paper must be my guide in endeavouring to describe
it. He has not only explained the subject and
meaning of the painting itself, but has illustrated his
explanation by a reduced <soCalled>fac-simile</soCalled> drawing;
and has given examples of each part of the design in
a carefully chosen series of extracts from the "Legenda Aurea," the " Acta Sanctorum," and other
recondite sources of monkish lore. The paper





<pb id="p.216" n="216"/>

is printed in the Transactions of the Surrey
Society.</p>
  <p>Armed, then, with the keys of the church, and
with Mr. Waller's key to the painting within, we
may enter. The church is only forty feet long at
most, yet it consists of a nave, two side aisles, a
chancel, and a side chapel. The basement is Norman, and does not answer in all respects to the plan
of the present building. The earlier church was
wider, probably, and shorter. The greater part of
what we see now is Early English: one or two of the
windows are Perpendicular, one or two Decorated.
A chapel on the north side was evidently removed,
and a Perpendicular window inserted in the aisle,
when a large flat arch was made and built up in
the chancel wall. It looks as if it had never contained
a window, and may be of fifteenth-century work.
The tower and spire were added some forty or fifty
years ago. The pulpit bears a name and date,
<quote>Patience Lambert, <date value="1657">1657</date>,</quote> and a curious tablet in
a style worthy of John of Padua and the Renaissance in England, and dated <date value="1562">1562</date>, has a quaint inscription which commences thus:- <quote>Good Redar,
warne all men and woomen whil they be here to be
ever good to the poore and nedy.</quote> It bears initials
and a semi-heraldic badge, but no name.  The
tombstones are not remarkable; the register commences in <date value="1564">1564</date>. The church is dedicated to St.
Paul; though it is sometimes spoken of as St.
Peter's, and in a will dated <date value="1440">1440</date>, as St. Peter and





                       <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>

St. Paul's. This would perhaps be the right designation.</p>
  <p>But the most remarkable thing in the church is
a <soCalled>tempera</soCalled> painting on the west wall, facing the
chancel arch. It is about seven feet from the ground,
and forms a band, chiefly of a deep brown or chocolate colour, divided across with a strip of conventional bordering, and vertically in the centre by a
portion of the design. The subject, according to
Mr. Waller, and he is no doubt right, is the  <quote>Ladder of the Salvation of the Human Soul, and the
road to Heaven,</quote>-in short a <soCalled><foreign lang="LA">scala caeli.</foreign></soCalled>  The
two bands represent respectively Heaven and Hell.
The ladder rises from the lower to the upper. It is
crowded with little figures: some climbing, others
falling off; some stopping by the way, others apparently being helped up by angels. On the right,
in the lower division, are figures of demons, tortures
great and small, the punishment of usury, of inebriety, of luxury, and other horrible conceptions,
whilst at the end is the Tree of Knowledge and the
serpent in its branches. To the left of the ladder
other evil spirits stir up a blazing caldron full of
souls, and little scenes of retribution are enacted in
every direction. In the upper division, to the left,
Michael is weighing the candidates for heaven,
while others are welcomed by angels from the summit of the ladder; on the right Enoch and Elijah
are seen ascending outside the ladder: a nimbus,
between the sun and moon, appears at the top; and






<pb id="p.218" n="218"/>

to the extreme right, above the forbidden tree, is a
representation of the descent into Hell, treated
according to the usual method.</p>
  <p>As examples of the stories current in the thirteenth century and here placed before the eyes of
the faithful, Mr. Waller gives some extracts. We
may take one as a specimen. Among the most
conspicuous of the strange figures is that of the
<soCalled>Usurer;</soCalled> a name which was applied not only to
a man who lent money at high or exorbitant rates
of interest, but also to a covetous or miserly person.
There are many horrible stories in the monks'
books of the end of such people. According to one
of them, which occurs in the Chronicle of Matthew
Paris, a monk of Evesham had a vision in <date value="1196">1196</date> of
Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise; and saw among
other sights a goldsmith being tormented on
account of frauds committed in his lifetime. In
the picture we see the method of punishment clearly
illustrated. The tongue hangs out, and coins drop
from the mouth. Bags of money are about the
waist and neck. He is compelled to count a heap
of red-hot money, and sits on a flaming seat. With
regard to some of the other figures, we have less unpleasant readings from ancient authors. Some of
the figures are represented as undergoing temptation,
and Mr. Waller takes occasion to speak of the early
Christian doctrine of good and bad spirits attendant
on the soul of man. From the <soCalled>Shepherd</soCalled> of Hermas
he makes a beautiful quotation. He tells us:-





                         <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>

   <quote>There are two angels with    man-one of
righteousness, the other of iniquity ..... The
angel of righteousness is mild, and modest, and
gentle, and quiet. When, therefore, he gets into
thy heart he talks with thee of righteousness, of
modesty, of chastity, of bountifulness, of forgiveness, of charity, and piety. When all these things
come into thy heart, know then that the angel of
righteousness is with thee .... Learn also the
works of the angel of iniquity. He is first of all
bitter, and angry, and foolish; and his works are
pernicious and overthrow the servants of God.
When therefore these things come into thy heart,
thou shalt know by his works that this is the angel
of iniquity .... When anger overtakes thee or
bitterness, know that he is in thee. As also when
the desire of many things, and of the best meats,
and of drunkenness, when the love of what belongs
to others, pride, and much speaking, and ambition,
and the like things come upon thee. When therefore these things come into thy heart, know that the
angel of iniquity is with thee.</quote></p>
  <p>But of all the old authors, Tundale best illustrates,
in his celebrated "Vision," the scenes here depicted.
The date of the poem is about <date value="1149">1149</date>, so that it is
just a little older than the painting if we accept, as
we safely may, Mr. Waller's estimate. Tundale
was an Irishman by birth, of noble rank, who
having died suddenly in a fit of passion, is conducted by his guardian angel through Hell, Purgatory,






<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>

and Paradise, as Dante describes himself in
the <hi rend="italics">Divina Commedia</hi>. The poem was exceedingly
popular, and   exists in  several languages and
dialects, including English. In it the <quote>long narrow bridge,</quote> which forms so remarkable a feature
of the Chaldon painting, is minutely   described:
<quote>Two mile of length it was seeming, and scarcely
of the breadth of a hand,</quote> so we read, modernising
the language.  <quote>It was grievous for to feel,</quote> being
all made of <quote>sharp pikes of iron and steel; and
no one could cross it without great pain and suffering. It passed over a lake in which were "hideous
beasts,</quote> that drew near the bridge to make a prey
of the souls that fell off. Tundale sees <quote>one stand
on the bridge, weeping
                    <quote rend="blockquote"><l>With a doleful cry,</l>
           <l>And plained his sin full piteously;</l>
           <l>The pikes his feet piked full sore:</l>
           <l>He dreaded the beasts much more</l></quote>.</quote>
Tundale asks his angel the meaning of this.
          <quote rend="blockquote"><l>The angel answered thus again:-</l>
          <l>For him is ordained this pain,</l>
          <l>That robbed men of their riches</l>
          <l>Or any goods that theirs is.</l></quote>
He goes on to say that the figure on the bridge so
sorely weeping is that of one who had stolen from
"Holy Chyrche."</p>
  <p>With regard to the style and execution of the
picture, it is worth while to refer to Mr.Waller more
at length, because similar pictures have been found




        <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>

of late years in many other churches, and considerable interest has been excited about them. Mr.
Waller notices that there is no filling-up of the
features, and that where two cross each other the
outlines of both appear, by which no doubt the
painter meant to indicate that they were ghosts,
and semi-transparent. The outlines show great
ease and a ready hand. The attitudes are well
contrasted, <quote>and throughout they are designed with
great simplicity, always following the end in view,
without the slightest affectation.</quote>  The picture is
painted in tempera, and not in fresco. All medieval
church painting was done in tempera; that is, the
colours were mixed with a kind of glue or size made
from shreds of parchment. The colours used are red
and yellow ochre, a little native cinnabar and white.</p>
  <p>Another painting was on the south side of this
one, on the face of the respond supporting the first
arch. This was destroyed in the restoration of the
church, during the temporary absence of the rector.
Had it not been for his vigilance all would have
been effaced. Who knows how much we have lost
in other places ? This departed picture, even though
departed, is of the utmost importance. From it
and from the conventional foliage of the Tree of
Knowledge at the north end of the west wall, Mr.
Waller is able to approximate by no means vaguely
to the date of the painting. The aisles are, as
we have seen, Early English, and cannot therefore
be earlier than the end of the twelfth century. On






<pb id="p.222" n="222"/>

the other hand, the " Tree " cannot be much later.
We thus arrive at a date between <date value="1170">1170</date> and <date value="1190">1190</date>.
With regard to the painter and the style of his art,
Mr. Waller makes some interesting observations,
from which we gather that the design was not unknown in the Greek Church; that this example is
very strictly in accordance with Byzantine rules for
such a work; that certain accessories are of a kind
to point to a French origin; but that on the whole,
if <soCalled>William the Englishman</soCalled> was worthy to succeed
William de Sens as architect of Canterbury Cathedral, there is no reason an English painter should
not have been found to execute this elaborate design.</p>
  <p>But the afternoon wanes rapidly as we sit questioning Mr. Waller, and diving into the "Vision "
of Tundale and the " Promptuarium Exemplorum."
There will be no time to visit Coulsdon Church or
the Reedham Asylum. So one more look at a
painting nearly two hundred years older than Orcagna, and we commit ourselves to a pleasant lane
through the hollow, emerging at length on the open
down, actually in sight of the Crystal Palace. We
had forgotten that London itself was only some
fifteen miles away at most. "Murray" mentions a
very steep hill up from Coulsdon. Going in the
opposite direction, it is very steep down; but the
up hill at the other side, though he does not mention
it, is twice as long and quite as steep.</p>
  <p>The ascent ceases at the summit of another wave
of the chalk. This one comprises the parish of





                      <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>

Coulsdon. But there is no painting in Coulsdon
Church, and although it is, or was at the time
of our visit, happily unrestored and in fair order,
I only delay to notice an epitaph mentioned in
the "Handbook," and again descending reach
another valley, clothed with thickets of hazel,
fruitful in nuts; and turn to the left at last into a
bridle road, each winding of which brings us nearer
to the Caterham Junction, and the busy haunts of
men. On the right is the Reedham Asylum, a not
unpleasing building high on the hill, and after a
short delay we cross the railway through an arch
and pursue the turnpike road between Croydon and
Redhill, until we arrive at the station. This last
half-mile along the dusty highway is, we find, more
fatiguing than any other part of our pleasant three
hours of hill and dale; but we fortunately get in
exactly two minutes before a train stops, and a
comparatively early return to London is secured.</p>
  <p>In looking back upon the afternoon's excursion, I
find a few items to note which may be of service to
future travellers. The key of Merstham Church is
kept in the village, between the station and the
church, and should be obtained on the way. If a
visit to Chaldon only is contemplated the little town
of Caterham will be found more convenient, and
vehicles may be had there at reasonable fares. The
drive from Caterham is almost as beautiful as the
walk from Merstham, and " Murray " need not be
read backwards.</p>

<p>THE modern traveller from London to St.
     Albans will conveniently, if unwittingly,
     follow the footsteps of a personage of
          whom it may safely be said that while
few in England are so ignorant that they do not
know her name, still fewer are so wise that they
know anything more. The semi-fabulous deeds of
Boadicea begin and end with a battle at St. Pancras
and a massacre at Verulam. The name of Verulam
is now lost in the modern name of St. Albans, if
anything so ancient can even comparatively be
called modem; and the fame of Battle Bridge is
obscured in Pentonville-road and King's-cross, although this last appellation has been taken by some
to refer to a victory of King Alfred himself.</p>
  <p>But an equally convenient route is by Euston and
the North-Western Railway through Watford.  By
this line the visitor will find himself deposited at the
foot of the hill on which the Abbey stands, and within
a few hundred yards of the most prominent relic of
the Roman city. He will probably make for the
Abbey at once, postponing his visit to the older if
<figure id="Fig.023" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.023.DO01.00023"><head>EAST END OF ST. ALBANS ABBEY.</head></figure>



                                    <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>

less interesting remains; and crossing the river from
which the ancient Verulam, or Gwerllan derived its
name, he will ascend Holywell-hill, remarking, as
he passes, the lane which leads on the right to the
ruins of Sopwell Nunnery, where flourished the
strong-minded Prioress, Juliana Berners, of sporting
and heraldic celebrity. If he wishes for something
to occupy his mind during the ascent, he may discuss with himself the truth of the story by which the
name is accounted for, and wonder if the first two
sisters did really sop their dry bread in the waters of
the holy well. The street is uninteresting, few of the
houses being ancient; and after the first view of the
Abbey, which is obtained from the railway station,
there is little to attract until a narrow passage on the
left suddenly reveals the glories of the east end, the
Lady-chapel, the south transept, the great tower,
and, as if purposely to contrast with the ruddy tones
of the ancient brickwork, a magnificent cedar, renewing its youth in a green and flourishing old age.
The Decorated windows of the Lady-chapel, although
unglazed and dilapidated, the flat Roman tile of
which the walls are built, the heavy Norman arches,
and the general absence of pinnacles or flying buttresses, all give a singular character to the building, and will impress the beholder with a sense of
the real unity of the heterogeneous pile. There is,
notwithstanding the prevalent decay, a business-like
air about it all. Strength, massiveness, completeness, were the objects of the builders,-not ornament.






<pb id="p.226" n="226"/>

The abbots were too busy with politics, the monks
too busy with literature, to have time to spend on
mere frivolity; and if this impression is not fully
borne out by a further examination of the church, it
is at least one which will be shared in at the first
sight by almost every visitor.</p>
  <p>Passing through an archway which leads from the
south side to the north between the sanctuary on the
left and the Lady-chapel on the right-a modern arrangement similar to that by which Wolsey's Chapel
is divided from the choir at St. George's at Windsor-
a lane which leads back to the street will be reached,
and a fine view obtained of the most remarkable
feature of the Abbey; for almost without end toward
the west stretches, arch after arch, bay after bay-
first Norman then Early English-the long-drawn
perspective of the nave. The north closely resembles
the south transept, both being mainly of Norman
construction, and both having an immense Perpendicular window at the end. A good view of the
same side may be obtained by entering an archway
adjoining a baker's shop in George-street, on the
left hand, after leaving the market-place, into which
the visitor will have emerged from the passage. An
ancient tower formerly stood opposite the street entrance to this passage, and marked the site of the
royal palace of Kingsbury; but the clock tower
itself has been utterly restored within the last few
years, and presents nothing but its name to interest
the archaeologist. In order to walk round the Abbey





                                  <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>

before visiting the interior, it will be necessary to
pass through George-street from the market-place,
and descending a hill to reach the open space at the
western extremity of the church, which still goes by
the suggestive name of Rome Land.</p>
  <p>Passing between the churchyard of the Abbey on
the left, and a triangular piece of ground-also a
cemetery-on the right, the road leads through the
only portion of the Abbey buildings which remains.
It is an Early English gateway, surmounted by a Perpendicular building which for centuries had been used
as a prison, but is now the site of King Edward the
Sixth's Grammar-school, removed from the Lady-
chapel, which it had long desecrated-a good thing
in the wrong place. The bibliographical visitor
will perhaps stop here to see the Caxtons unearthed
in an old cupboard in the chapel by Mr. Blades in
<date value="1857">1857</date>; otherwise he will pursue his way towards the
east, along a narrow path between the grassy
mounds which mark the site of the cloisters, the
chapter-house, the refectory, the dormitories, and
all the other buildings of a great monastery, of
which now not a vestige remains. Dr. Stukeley tells
of their destruction in <date value="1722">1722</date>, and a drawing or two
at the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries testify to their greatness. The marks of the
roofing of the cloisters remain in the south wall of
the nave, and the rest of the buildings which were as
usual placed around them. From the top of the great
tower, and especially in dry weather, their plan may






<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>

be traced by the colour of the grass and the general
direction of the mounds which mark their site. The
great length of the nave, at this side chiefly of
pointed work, shows well from the cloister; and the
low building in front of the south transept recalls
the chapel of St. Blaize at Westminster Abbey, and
points to the site of the chapter-house. The path
leads under the turrets of the transept to the east
side, where it reaches the foot of the yew-tree already
mentioned near the Lady-chapel, and the door by
which at present the church is usually entered. This
was the door of the sacristy, which lay parallel to the
south transept, but has now entirely disappeared.</p>
  <p>Once within the Abbey a feeling of despair comes
over the visitor.  The impossibility of noticing
everything worthy of notice, the vastness of the
edifice, the seemingly puny efforts of modem art to
rival or even to sustain the wonders of old time, the
memories which crowd upon the brain, and the mere
physical fatigue induced by traversing the long
aisles and ascending the almost inaccessible tower,
-all these produce a confusion of mind from which
it takes some time to rally. The present building
or collection of buildings began to be made in the
days of Eadmer, the ninth Abbot, towards the close
of the tenth century. He collected materials for
rebuilding the church of Offa; and he seems to have
set the example, so extensively followed in later
times, of using the materials of the Roman Verulam
for the construction of the English abbey. But it was





                                   <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>

not until the incumbency of Paul, the first Norman
Abbot, that any part of the present building was
begun, and carried out so effectually that the tower,
the transepts, and the easternmost bays of the nave,
attest his industry to this day. Some of the pillars
in the transepts present features usually assigned
to the semi-mythical Saxon period of our architecture, but it is hardly possible that these are part of
the materials either of an older building or of the
collections of Eadmer. The most prominent interior
defect is the want of vaulting; for although in parts
a barrel vault, and in others a wooden arched roof
are to be seen, the flat ceiling, or boarding, of the
latest period, is unsatisfactory in the extreme. The
medieval builders were probably aware, that notwithstanding the great thickness of the walls, the
material of which they were constructed and the
method of construction pursued would not bear the
thrust of a heavy vaulting; and their fears are
justified by the very insecure appearance now of the
south wall of the nave, with its beautiful Early
English and Decorated details. It is the eastern end,
with its chapels and its sanctuary, which has suffered
most in the lapse of ages. The chapels are gone;
a public path crosses behind the altar; the Lady-
chapel has been till lately a grammar-school; and
of the magnificent marble shrine of the saint himself nothing remains but the marks in the floor of
the sockets of the marble pillars by which it was
elevated to such a height that it might be seen even

from the high altar of the choir and over the lofty
screen.<note place="foot" n="1">Several portions have been recovered since these lines
were written.</note> The glory of all this has departed, and
much else that was glorious with it; yet it must not
be supposed that St. Albans suffered at the dissolution a tithe of the destruction which fell upon Malmesbury, or Glastonbury, or Woburn. Sir William
Petre, of whom we have given some account in our
notes of a visit to Ingatestone, was associated with
Thomas Leigh, another commissioner of Henry
VIII. and his minister, Cromwell; to whom, no
doubt, much of the destruction commonly attributed
to another Cromwell and his Ironsides, properly
belongs.  They report that, having visited  St.
Albans Abbey during the absence of the Abbot in
London, they summoned him before them, and endeavoured to persuade him to surrender.    He
seems to have been very unwilling to do so, and
said he would rather have to beg his bread all the
days of his life.  However, whether his resolution
failed, or whether he was tempted by handsome
offers, he at length, as we know, surrendered peacefully, was well pensioned, and afterwards himself
became by purchase the possessor of the ancient
precincts, finally yielding them to Queen Mary, in
contemplation of her intention of restoring him as
Abbot and renewing the greatness of the Abbey. This
intention was never carried out, but the church was
saved. Its destruction had almost begun. The first






                                  <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>

grantee of the site had pulled down the parish
church of St. Andrew, which stood on the north side
in the churchyard, as St. Margaret's yet stands at
Westminster; and but for Boreman's timely interference all would also have been ruined.</p>
  <p>The Abbey of St. Albans is itself so closely wound
up with our national history, that any detailed
account of it would be a mere cento from the chronicles. Yet, viewed from various points, it will be
found a curious and instructive commentary. A
series of scenes, more or less real, more or less
authentic, more or less connected one with the other,
are presented successively, whilst, like the hero of an
old romance, the proto-martyr of Britain-or, as the
monks seem usually to have called him, in defiance
of history, the proto-martyr of England-comes into
prominence over and over again, living or dying,
dead, buried, or dug up again, until, by the mere
force of reiteration, the story becomes true, if it
wanted truth before, and the effects of the legend
are greater than the subject of the legend itself.
Tradition is a weak staff to lean upon; yet it was
the tradition of five centuries upon which Offa
II. was content to found his Abbey and establish his colony of Benedictines. Alban suffered in
the fourth century, when, according to the St.
Albans Chronicle, in MS. at <placeName key="Lambeth">Lambeth</placeName>, quoted by
Dr. Nicholson, <quote>was gret persecution of Christen
pepell by the tyrant Diocletian.</quote> Amphibalus, by
whom he had been converted, was put to death at





<pb id="p.232" n="232"/>

Redbourne, not far off, and his relics, having been
discovered in the reign of Henry II., were brought to
the Lady-chapel and interred near those of the friend
from whom he had been separated for seven hundred
years or more. Gildas and Bede are the earliest
historians by whom St. Alban is mentioned. All
the more minute particulars of his martyrdom must
be apocryphal. Tradition says that the exact spot
on which he suffered was where the north transept
now stands, and that a tablet was placed on the wall
of the Roman city in the valley below detailing the
crime and the punishment as a warning to future
offenders. That his remains were not burnt according to the Roman rule, but were buried where he
fell, we owe to the piety of his disciples: that they
were discovered hidden under the turf- <quote><foreign lang="LA">sub
cespite diu absconditum,</foreign></quote> as Matthew Paris puts
at-must be acknowledged a miracle. Nor was
his martyrdom the last which his city witnessed.
An interval of twelve hundred and fifty-three
years and two months separates it from that
of George Tankerville, who, under the regime of
Bishop Bonner, was burnt alive on the triangular
plot of land to westward of the Abbey, and in
front of the Abbey gateway of which we have
already spoken. His persecutors no doubt took care
that no future Offa should discover his remains;
but when the flames which consumed him died out,
with them died the last hope of restoring the system
whose splendid results, towering above and around





                                  <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>

his stake, must have seemed hateful to his latest gaze.
The spot on which he suffered reminds us of the
scene of Hooper's execution at Gloucester; the same
west window seems to look down on both, and the
story of the Abbey of St. Mary resembles not distantly that of the Abbey of St. Alban, up to the
point at which one became the seat of an episcopal
see, and the other, less fortunate though not less
deserving, became, by the generosity of a private
individual, a parish church. Master Stump, a rich
clothier of the town, bought it for &#x00A3;400 and presented it for ever to his fellow-parishioners of St.
Andrews. The advowson was, until recent times, in
private hands, but having been purchased by the
late venerated rector, Dr. Nicholson, it was bequeathed to the see of Rochester.</p>
  <p>The story of the relics of St. Alban is a typical
example of what may be called the irony of history.
According to one account, the body of the martyr
was early transferred to Rome. According to a
second, and equally good authority, it was removed to Cologne. According to a third, it was
preserved at Ely. According to a fourth, it never
left the scene of the martyrdom. All these accounts
cannot be true, nor can all the minor legends which
crop up here and there in the medieval books. A
correspondence which took place in the Guardian in
<date value="1871">1871</date>, threw some light on the subject, and from it I
venture to epitomise the following notes on the
shrine and relics.
</p>




<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>

  <p>We find then that, to take the earliest story first,
the tomb of St. Alban was known at Verulam 125
years after his martyrdom, when it was visited by
St. Germanus, who, it will be remembered, held a
council at Verulam in <date value="429">429</date> to combat the opinions of
Pelagius. St. Germanus was presented with a portion of the relics as a token of gratitude for his exertions in healing the wounds of the British Church.
These relics, according to Constantius, consisted
only of a lump of earth saturated with the blood of
the martyr.  According to Molanus ("Martyrologia Usuardi," Antwerp, <date value="1583">1583</date>), they consisted of St.
Alban's head and the upper portion of his body.
Constantius is very minute in his description of a
sod, <quote><foreign lang="LA">in qua apparebat, cruore servato rubere, martyrum caedem, persecutore pallente.</foreign></quote> Now Constantius, we must bear in mind, was the contemporary of
Germanus. His is the earliest authority for the
martyrdom of St. Alban; but for the after-legend,
it only proves that his tomb was shown at Verulam
in the fifth century.</p>
  <p>St. Germanus transported the relic, whatever it
was, to Ravenna, where he died in <date value="448">448</date>, when it was
removed to Rome. There is next a mention in <date value="731">731</date>
by Bede of the thaumaturgic powers of the martyr's
tomb at Verulam, <quote>to this very day.</quote>    Next,
in <date value="793">793</date>, Offa founded the Abbey; but the tomb was
unknown and the bones lost. Sixty-two years of
disturbance and war must be taken to account for
so strange a fact. A dream was needed to reveal





                                  <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

the secret. Offa, at Bath, had the required dream,
searched in a cemetery on the hill above Verulam,
and, we are not surprised to hear, discovered there
a body, which a miracle further identified as that of
St. Alban. Offa surrounded the skull with a golden
circlet, on which, in defiance of history, he wrote,
<quote><foreign lang="LA">Hoc est caput Sancti Albani Anglorum proto
martyris.</foreign></quote>  The building of the Abbey went on
from this with various interruptions for four hundred years. Meanwhile, the Empress Theophania,
wife of Otho II., visited Rome in 989. She visited
the shrines of SS. Peter and Paul, and was presented by the Pope with the relics of St. Alban,
which St. Germanus had brought to Ravenna 550
years before. The following year she carried them
with her to Mentz, where, by the advice of the
Archbishop, she changed her saint's name to
Albinus, there being already another St. Alban in
the neighbourhood. She went on to Cologne, where
she finally deposited the relics with the Order of St.
Pantaleon, and, to use the words of Dr. Back, in
his <hi rend="italics">Heilige Koln</hi>, as we have them translated by
Mr. Rabbetts, <quote>according to the venerable traditions
of the St. Pantaleon's Order, the relics which are
enshrined in the above-mentioned magnificent shrine
were no doubt always considered and adored as the
earthly remains of that martyr St. Alban who had
obtained the palm of martyrdom, as the first martyr
and Christian hero of the faith on English soil at
Verula, in England, Hardfordshire (Hertfordshire),




<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>

at the time of the Emperor Diocletian, about the
year <date value="303">303</date>.</quote>  Now, as to the rest of the story of the
English relics.</p>
  <p>In the tenth century, according to Matthew Paris,
St. Albans was visited by the Danes and the relics
carried to Denmark, where they were for some time
venerated in an abbey of Black Monks, till, by a
special intervention of the saint himself, they were
restored to the country <quote>where he shed his blood
for Christ.</quote>  (<hi rend="italics">Vit&#x00E6; Abbatum</hi>, p. 992.)   At the
time of the Norman Conquest (here we quote from
Mr. King's letter) <quote>the relics of St. Alban were, it
was asserted, removed to Ely for greater security.
The <hi rend="italics">Liber Eliensis</hi> declares that they were never
restored, and that they always formed one of the
treasures of Ely. Matthew Paris asserts that the
Abbot of St. Albans concealed the true relics in the
wall of his own church (whence they were removed
and enshrined when the country had become safer),
and substituted for them some ordinary bones, which
were sent in all honour to Ely.</quote></p>
  <p><quote>At the later translation, in the reign of Henry
III., the bones of the martyr were carefully numbered, and, with the exception of one small relic
which was known to be in Spain, were found perfect.
This was done because <quote><foreign lang="LA">quoddam Collegium  in
Dacia</foreign></quote>-no doubt the Benedictine monastery to
which the Danish plunderers had carried the relics
-and also the monastery of Ely, <quote><foreign lang="LA">mendaciter
asserebant</foreign></quote> that they were in possession of the





                                 <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

true remains (Matthew Paris, <hi rend="italics">Vit&#x00E6; Abbatum</hi>, p.
1010).</quote></p>
  <p>Next, we read in the St. Albans Chronicle the
relics were carried round the town in <date value="1429">1429</date>, together
with the shrines of two other saints, <quote>when the
weather, which had been cloudy and dark, became
bright and clear as soon as the reliquary was borne
forth, though the day following was marked by a hailstorm.</quote><note place="foot" n="2">Riley's Chron. Mon. S. Alb., p. 36.</note> In <date value="1431">1431</date> the same means were taken
to produce a contrary effect, and with equal success.
And so on, until the dissolution. We must now
return to Cologne, with Dr. Nicholson, who went to
visit the shrine in that city. We quote from Mr.
Lloyd:-
  <quote>In <date value="1850">1850</date> the Rev. Dr. Nicholson, rector of the
Abbey, read a paper [afterwards printed] before the
Architectural and Archaeological Society of St.
Alban, in which he said that the above statement
had raised in him a desire to pursue some inquiry
into the subject, and he proceeded to narrate how,
after consulting many ponderous folios for histories
of the saint, he had lately remained a day at
Cologne, and had been permitted to see in St.
Mary's Church that shrine whose roof, gables, and
sides he describes as having upon them numerous
figures, &#x0026;c., in silver-gilt, and also thirty-three
Latin verses, two of them being those quoted by
Mr. Thompson.</quote></p>


<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>

  <p>Mr. R. J. King has thus summed up the questions
at issue:
  <quote>All that can be said is, that the remains sent to
Cologne by the Empress Theophania were probably
as genuine as those so long reverenced in their
magnificent shrine at St. Albans. It is possible
that Offa, digging in the neighbourhood of Verulamium, may have lighted on an ancient sepulchre
containing human remains. The belief that any
relics so discovered were those of St. Alban rests on
evidence altogether <soCalled><foreign lang="LA">supra historicam</foreign></soCalled>.</quote></p>
  <p><quote>Messrs. Buckler, in their account of St. Albans,
assert that the relics contained in the shrine were
carried to Rome after the dissolution; and that
they are still preserved there.</quote></p>
  <p>So that if the real relics are anywhere they are
at St. Albans; the relics found by Offa perhaps at
Rome; those carried away by Germanus at Ravenna;
those presented to Theophania at Cologne.</p>
  <p>Fragments of the shrine itself have been found
during the progress of the work of restoration, built
into various modern walls, and have been replaced
where they formerly stood.</p>
  <p>I return to the history of the Abbey itself. Many
remarkable events of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries took place at St. Albans.</p>
  <p>It was here in <date value="1357">1357</date>, and afterwards, that the
Black Prince lodged his royal captive, during the
incumbency of Abbot de la Mare; and the story of
the concealment of treasure by Sir John de Molins,





                                 <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

of which I spoke in my chapters on " London Four
Centuries Ago" (p. 87), probably relates to the same
Abbot. Here, in <date value="1381">1381</date>, Jack Straw and his followers
besieged the monks. Here the first conspiracy
against Richard II. was hatched at the table of
Abbot de la Motte. Here the Duke of Lancaster
and the King lodged on the way to the deposition
scene at Westminster; while the bold Bishop who
protested against Henry's usurpation was here committed to the Abbot's custody; and, not long after,
the Abbot attended the funeral of Richard at King's
Langley, and was buried himself within the year.
Here, forty-six years later, <soCalled>good</soCalled> Duke Humphrey
was buried. From the eastern gallery of the tower
the monks watched anxiously in <date value="1455">1455</date>, while the
battle in the Key Field, near the Sopwell Nunnery,
was decided against the family of their patron:
they could see the wounded creeping down to the
river to quench their burning thirst and wash their
wounds, and their companions searching the town
till the King was captured in the house of Sir
Edmund Westby, bailiff and tanner. But in <date value="1459">1459</date>
the same King comes in state to St. Albans, and,
having been the guest of the Abbot during the
Easter week, leaves his best gown to the Prior as a
present. Once more at least was he at St. Albans,
this time to be again captured, but by his own party.
The battle was fought at Bernard's Heath, beyond
St. Peter's Church, on a snowy Shrove Tuesday, in
<date value="1461">1461</date>; and the King, Queen, and Prince of Wales





<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>

attended at the Abbey on Ash Wednesday, not for
humiliation, but to give thanks for their victory.
Yet the Queen did not prevent her army from sacking the Abbey immediately after, and the Abbot
and monks, who had previously favoured the Lancastrians, beheld with pleasure the proclamation of
Edward IV. in the following month. Between the
date of the two battles the tomb of Duke Humphrey
of Gloucester was made, in a place of honour, close
to the shrine of St. Alban himself, and surmounted
by the care of Abbot Wheathampstead with sculptured canopies and delicate carving, which far surpass those of his own monument in the choir. The
coffin of Duke Humphrey may be viewed through a
grated door, but the curious fresco, or distemper
painting rather, which formerly decorated the wall,
is almost obliterated.</p>
  <p>But it is chiefly for its services to literature that
St. Albans deserves well of the men of this generation. It was early a seat of learning; and retained
its reputation until after the invention of printing.
Abbot &#x00C6;lfric, in the reign of King Edgar, translated
parts of the Old Testament into the vernacular,
and left among other writings a Latin and Saxon
Glossary. He became Archbishop of Canterbury in
<date value="995">995</date>, and died in <date value="1005">1005</date>. A long succession of names
represent the men who in after ages sustained the
honour of the genius loci which he had evoked.
Such were another &#x00C6;lfric, the eleventh Abbot;
Robert de Gorham, who is said to have refused admission


                                 <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>

to one Nicholas Breakspere, on account of
the insufficiency of his learning, although this was
that Nicholas who afterwards reached at Rome the
Chair of St. Peter and remains as Adrian IV., the
only Englishman who ever sat in it; Symon, who
is best known by his connection with <persName key="Thomas a Becket">Becket</persName>, and
who repaired and enlarged the scriptorium, and built
a library adjoining the south aisle of the nave;
Wallingford, the clockmaker, twenty-eighth Abbot ;
above all, Wheathampstead, in whose incumbency
the scriptorium attained its highest excellence, upwards of eighty books having been transcribed in
his time; and Wallingford, under whose patronage
a press was set up, and the first book printed at St.
Albans as early as <date value="1483">1483</date>. As might be expected this
was a chronicle, for the Abbey had always been famous
for its chroniclers; and Matthew Paris, William Rishanger, Thomas Walsingham, Roger Wendover, John
of Tynemouth, and Thomas Ramrydge, afterwards
Abbot, were all historians, whom modern historians
can well afford to honour.  Of all, the first is the
most remarkable. Matthew, the chronicler, according to recent researches, was Matthew Paris, and
though a distinction has been made between him
and another Matthew, surnamed of "Westminster,"
it seems probable now that there was only one
Matthew, and that he was the monk of St. Albans
of whom we speak. His own original manuscript
is in the British Museum,<note place="foot" n="3">Royal MS. 14. c. vii.</note> and contains his


<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>

portrait, representing him as kneeling before the
Blessed Virgin and her Son. He is in the monastic
dress, and over his head his name is written in
Latin. The book contains a history of England
from <date value="1067">1067</date> to <date value="1253">1253</date>, almost entirely in the handwriting of Matthew himself. John of Basingstoke
was a deacon of St. Albans; and Nicholas, a chaplain, was the assistant of Grosseteste; indeed, a list
of the literary men who flourished here would alone
occupy all our space.</p>
  <p>Attempts have been made to trace the fate of the
great library which must have accumulated here
before the dissolution. Many of the books have
been identified. In the British Museum, in the
Bodleian, in private collections, these old treasures
are now scattered about to tell both of the industry
and of the taste of the St. Albans Scriptorium. Of
all these books there are few more interesting than
a folio volume in the National Library, part of the
famous Cottonian collection. Like the rest of Sir
Robert Cotton's books it is classified by the name of
one of the Twelve Caesars, and is best known to
antiquarians under the title of Nero D. 7. It contains a catalogue of benefactors to the Abbey who
had been admitted to the fraternity of St. Alban
before the year <date value="1463">1463</date>, together with their portraits,
painted in a rough but effective style. The greater
part of the book was compiled by Thomas Walsingham in <date value="1380">1380</date>, but there are additions which bring
it down a hundred years later. In a list of the





                                  <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

abbots we have portraits, more or less conjectural
of the early ones, and some very elaborate paintings
representing Abbot Wheathampstead, and of two of
the others. But most of the pictures are not so
highly finished. One of them, which shows us
Abbot John of Berkhamstede, who appears in some
way to have offended his monks, is very curious.
The following is a translation of what the biographer tells us about him :--<note place="foot" n="4">Some further particulars regarding Abbot John of Berkhamsted will be found at p. 204.</note>
  <quote>Since he did nothing memorable in his life we
shall place nothing respecting him in the present
page; but we warn the reader that he be converted
to works of piety, and pour forth prayers to the
Omnipotent for his soul.</quote> One would hardly gather
from this that Abbot John had been so distinguished
for his efforts to emancipate the monks from the
King's control; and the picture represents him
not only with a deplorable countenance, but in an
attitude admirably expressive of remorse.</p>
  <p>It is curious to note, regarding this picture, that
though it was painted so many centuries ago, we
know the name of the painter, and several other
circumstances relating to the history of the bock.
In a list of the monks at that time in the abbey we
are told of Thomas de Walsingham that he <quote>compiled this book and procured from John de Bedingham and Christiana his wife seven marks of







<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>

money for the work of the new gate.</quote> His success
in begging is thus put to his credit. A little further
on we have the name of the scribe who wrote the
book out fair: it was "Willelmus de Wylum."
And near the end we have the illuminator's name.
He seems to have done more than merely work
himself. We read of him, <quote>Alan Strayler worked
much upon the painting of this book, and gave
three shillings and four pence, which was owed to
him for colours.</quote> Alan adds a little couplet in
rhyming Latin expressive of his satisfaction, and of
his pious hope that with the celestial choirs he may
be everlastingly associated. Beside the verses he
favours the reader with his likeness. This book
came by some means into the possession of Queen
Mary; it was next owned by the great LordVerulam,
Francis Bacon, whose residence and whose grave
are not beyond the sound of the Abbey bells. He
gave it in <date value="1623">1623</date> to Sir Robert Cotton, and it happily
escaped the fire which destroyed so many of its
companions.</p>
  <p>The monastery, notwithstanding the mollifying
influence of the arts, oppressed the town with an
iron hand. Twice during the eighteen years of
Eversden's incumbency was the Abbey besieged by
the burghers. They gained by the King's special
interference some alleviation of their bondage, but
even the strong rule of Edward III. was unable to
prevent Wallingford from resuming the charter, and
forbidding the town even to send its representatives






                                  <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>

to Parliament. The pride, too, of these spiritual
peers is constantly evinced in their contests for the
precedence accorded to them by Adrian IV., and the
rivalry and jealousy of the Abbot of the royal
foundation of Westminster. Another questionable
feature is the importance of an officer whose very
existence is capable of a sinister construction.
Time after time was the Cellarer elected Abbot;
nay, John de la Moote, one of the most eminent of
the line, when Cellarer, before his election, was put
into the stocks, as we read, at Luton, by Philip de
Limburg, in hatred to the Abbot and <quote>utter contempt of religion.</quote></p>
  <p>The history of the Abbey after the dissolution offers
few features of interest. The general absence of
seventeenth-century tombs and of eighteenth-century
tablets is worthy of remark. A few flat stones
commemorate parochial officers; but the monuments,
after the brasses, or their marks on so many graves,
have been examined, leave hardly anything of note.
Of the later inscriptions which occur perhaps the
most remarkable is that of John Jones, Master of
the Grammar-school, which was as follows:--<note place="foot" n="5"> H. S. E. Iohannes Iones Wallus, Scholae S. Albanensis

for that he wrote ' The Fane of St. Alban,' a poem
in heroic verse, which will last longer than this
slab, than even this building or the very age itself.</quote>
Another has often been quoted for its quaintness:-
<quote>In memory of Thomas Sheppard, son of Thos.
and Mary Sheppard, died Feb. ye 15th <date value="1766">1766</date> Aged
xxx years.

         <l>Great was my Grief, I could not Rest,</l>
         <l>God called me hence, He thought it best;</l>
        <l> Unhappy marriage was my fate:</l>
        <l>I did repent when it was too late.</l></quote>"

 And one or two of the Abbots' tombs still bear
 part at least of their brass inlaying: among them
 are a couple of fragmentary inscriptions. On a
 stone in the sanctuary is the brass of Robert
 Beauner, a monk, with the words from the fifty-first
 psalm, <quote><foreign lang="LA">Cor mundum in me crea Deus</foreign></quote> - <quote>Create
 a clean heart in me, O God,</quote>  and a short epitaph
 stating the date of his death, <date value="1470">1470</date>, and the fact that
 for forty years he had filled various minor offices in
 the abbey. Not far off is another stone, from which
 everything has been torn except the scroll which
 issued from the mouth of a vanished monk, whose
 figure, as may be seen by the marks of the brass,
 once knelt at the foot of a crucifix by which stood






                                      <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>

the Virgin and St. John. On the scroll is this
verse from an old hymn of the Sarum Breviary:-
        <quote rend="blockquote"><foreign lang="LA">Salva Redemptor plasma Tuum nobile,
          <lb/>Signatum Sancto vultus Tui lumine,
          <lb/>Nec lacerari sinas fraude daemonum
          <lb/>Propter quos mortis exsolvisti pretium</foreign> ;</quote>
which may be translated-
      <quote rend="blockquote">Save, Lord, the work Thy hands have wrought,
          <lb/>The face illumined by Thy smiles;
        <lb/>Nor suffer those Thy blood has bought
          <lb/>To perish through the devil's wiles.</quote>
Near these are the despoiled gravestones of Abbot
Stoke, Abbot John of Berkhamsted, and of another
Abbot who cannot now be identified, although the
inscription remains, for it runs thus :-
  <quote rend="blockquote"><foreign lang="LA">Hic quidem terra tegitur, peccati solvens debitum,
    <lb/>Cui nomen non imponitur, in libro vitae sit conscriptum.</foreign></quote>
It is hardly possible to give the beauty of these
lines in an English version, but the following
attempt has been made :-
            <lb/>One here is laid, who dying paid
              <lb/>In death the debt of sin;
            <lb/>His name, not here, may yet appear
              <lb/>The Book of Life within.
According to Mr. Haines it is the brass of Abbot
John Moote.    Royalists were imprisoned here, as
appears from   a name cut upon the wall of the
sacrarium, <quote>Hugh    Lewis souldier in    his  Maies
army taken prisoner at Ravensfield, Northampton-

  <p>The repairs contemplated, and in part already
carried out, are of a very thorough kind. The great
tower, 140 feet in height, and open to the church
almost from roof to floor, was in a tottering condition.  The Roman bricks of which it is built, or
rather heaped up, have yielded to the weight of two
thousand years, and a settlement at the southern
side threatened its very existence.  The fees for
viewing the church go to increase the fund; but
they are so moderate, and the number of visitors so
small, that little appreciable influence is exerted on
the total sum required.  The whole, or nearly the
whole, of the church has been covered with whitewash, and its removal, and the restoration of the
ancient painted plaster work, is an expensive
process. The walls of the south aisle lean perceptibly outward; and though something might
be done by buttressing to remedy their inclination,
yet the unity of the building would be seriously
compromised, and Sir Gilbert Scott may have
no choice but to pull down and rebuild the whole
side. The chief repairs provided since the Abbey
became a parish church have been of a temporary
character. James I., it is true, took an interest in
the place, but his exertions were of the vicarious
kind which he usually employed. He took much
credit to himself for the translation of the Bible, for
which others had to pay; and at St. Albans,
though he granted leave to his Queen and her maids
to search in the ruins for treasure, his chief contribution





                                   <pb id="p.249" n="249"/>

towards the repairs was a brief permitting
his subjects to subscribe.</p>
  <p>Much permanent benefit may be expected to result from the repairs, so far, carried out. But it is
impossible not to regret that the look of antiquity
should in any way be rubbed off. When we look at
the delicate iridescence and rich hues with which the
old bricks seem to be coloured, at the creeping
lichens and many-toned weather-stains which lend
a harmonious and subtle tinting to the venerable
walls and crumbling stones, we feel a kind of
trembling hope that the architect will deal tenderly
with the ancient pile, and perhaps, for old times'
sake,
           <quote rend="blockquote">Be to its faults a little blind,
           <lb/>And to its failings not unkind.</quote></p>
  <p>In the town of St. Albans the visitor will find little
to interest him.  The absence of ordinary sanitary
arrangements will remind him of the state of many
picturesque continental cities; but here it is the
more unpleasant, from the want of the compensating
attractions.  Yet a walk should be taken through
the market-place to St. Peter's Church, half of
which, with the tombs of those who fell at Bernard's
Heath and the Key Field, the knights and mighty
men of old, was destroyed during the prevalence of
an improving mania in the early years of the present century. A long street leads past Rome Land
and the Abbey gate down to the river's edge and up
the opposite slope to St. Michael's Church, whose






<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>

quaint half-timbered gables and flint walls derive a
double interest from the tomb of Francis, Lord
Verulam and Viscount of St. Albans, which they
contain. On leaving the grave of Bacon, the visitor
should descend to the river again, and, keeping on
its right bank by a footpath, should see the remains
of a Roman wall and the marks of Roman fortifications in the meadows on his way, and so return to


<figure id="Fig.024" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.023.DO01.00024"><head>DOORWAY, NORTH TRANSEPT, ST. ALBANS ABBEY.</head></figure>

<pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

the station.  We were at St. Albans in the early
autumn, and at this season such a walk should by
no means be omitted. The gleam of the setting sun
on the tower of the Abbey, and the ruddy glow with
which the old brickwork answers back, the dark green
of the elms lower on the hill, the shadows creeping
across the meadows by the river and gradually
rising to the Abbey itself, all go to form a picture
not easily forgotten; and so the weary sightseer is
whirled back towards London through the cornfields
and pastures of Hertfordshire, and finds himself
repeating half-unconsciously the misspelt motto on
Abbot Wheathampstead's tomb :-<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="LA">Valles habundabunt</foreign>.</hi>
