No attempt has been made by either artist or author to
give in this book a stereotyped and exhaustive survey
of London, that has been done better elsewhere; it is
rather the book of two people who love London in all
her varying moods, with her wonder, her unexpectedness,
her dear familiarity. The questions, "Have I
represented this or that or the other?" or "Will not
the public miss so and so which always appears in
every book of London?" have never once been asked.
</p><p>  Artist and author alike have painted and written
out of love, and out of their knowledge of the most
wonderful city the world has ever known. It is rather
as though they said, "Have you ever seen London like
that? Do you know just that peculiar atmosphere that
comes in the grey morning or wintry evening? Have
you realised that the streets are glorious with the records
of the great dead ? Can you see them, princes, statesmen,
bishops, nobles, men of letters, men of science,
walking about by-gone London, the same city at heart
but so different in aspect from what it is now?"



<pb id="p.VI"  n="VI"/>
  </p><p> This is all I have to say,-for statistics, for minute
catalogues of names, for many other highly useful things,
look elsewhere; this book is painted and written by two
who love London for those who would be, or are, her
lovers also.
  </p><p> The Artist and Publishers desire me to take this
opportunity of thanking those owners whose names are
printed in the List of Illustrations, for kindly lending
the original pictures to be reproduced in the volume.

      <head> CHAPTER I: Poem: London As A Piece of Mosaic</head>

   <p>LONDON is not one homogeneous whole, alike in all
her parts, but rather a glittering piece of mosaic work,
consisting of innumerable facets, each separate in itself
yet united with the rest, and forming together a
   wondrous and intricate pattern. There are mud-coloured
   lines and dark patches as well as ruby points:
   seen from one angle the total result is grey confusion,
   seen from another the radiant points so scintillate as to
   conceal the darker parts. Both visions are true, both
   are equally London, yet neither is the whole truth, for
   neither of mud nor of rubies is the great city made.</p>
   <p>The casual visitor, and the foreigner who looks at
   her from afar, can never know London.  To the latter
   all detail is lost, her majesty only is manifest; he sees
   the magnificence of the whole, heightened by the value
   of her position, and the permanence of her historic
   setting, but he sees none of the light and shade, the
   infinite diversity of detail which are really London.
   The casual visitor sees the detail prominently enough,






<pb id="p.4"  n="4"/>
but sees part of it only. He is impressed by one aspect,
probably "the dust and din and steam of town," and
carries that away with him as his mental reference to
London. Therefore it is not the foreigner or the
stranger who knows her as she should be known. That
knowledge comes only after years of patient intimacy;
by slow growth, like the growth of the one friendship of
a lifetime; by adding facet to facet and interweaving
the mosaic as a part of the background of daily life:
thus only can one know the mystery and the fascination
of London, and feel it in one's blood until it becomes a
love second only to the strong love felt for the home of
one's childhood.</p>
   <p>The aspect most familiar to the stranger, and
probably one of the most repellent, is that of the streets
at mid-day on one of those days so frequent in the
climatic cycle through which we are passing. A day of
grey skies and mud-brown streets, when the drab and
stone-coloured walls put on their dingiest tones, and the
passers-by form a stream as monotonous and uninteresting
as a lowland brook.</p><p><figure id="fig.002" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00002"><head>
HYDE PARK CORNER</head></figure></p>
   <p>Any street will do as the background for such a
picture.  Take the <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> end of Shaftesbury
Avenue as a specimen. Here several omnibuses stand
at the corner, and the passers-by thread their way amid
the inert loiterers. Here is a man moving briskly, he
knows what he wants, and thinks little of what may be
correctly deemed a "shove "-hardly a push-in order
to attain it. He is short without being exceptionally
so, spare without actual thinness; his fair hair and











 <pb id="p.5"  n="5"/>
moustache are sparse and straw-coloured, his face not
noticeably differing from them in hue. He is decently
and even warmly clothed, yet he cannot, by any stretch
of the imagination, be called well dressed. Age and
position can only be guessed approximately, for he may
be anything from five-and-twenty to forty, and in
position from a plumber to a clerk. Multiply him by
the million, and you have the men who make the wheels
go round, with so little pleasure or profit to themselves
in the process that the wonder is that the momentum
which started them is sufficient to keep them running.
And yet perhaps the exertion required to come to a full
stop would be greater.</p>
   <p>Here comes a boy in buttons pulling on white thread
gloves as he walks, a putty-faced lad with abnormally
smooth hair, and an expression which may be termed
unwholesome. Two elderly ladies in passing hold up
their skirts unnecessarily high, and display square-toed
boots the worse for wear; they are of a better class
than the young man who jumped on to the 'bus before
them, "ladies" in the usual, not the shop-girl's, sense of
the word. In every line of their clothes, in every
movement they make, they betray the price they have
paid for this gentility, namely, the loss of freedom and
the narrowness of the stultified lives they lead. A bold
girl comes next, with her hair in curl papers, her eyes
bright and roving; you feel she is ready, on the smallest
provocation, to emit the scream which with her is the
sign of enjoyment; over her arm she carries a black
linen cloth concealing some finished clothes which she






<pb id="p.6"  n="6"/>

has been machining for the "sweater."  Two nondescript
men of an altogether unascertainable rank, but
well dressed and smoking cigars, part at the street
corner with much affectionate handshaking and returning
for another last word. Their very exuberance
of friendship, in contrast with their narrow faces and
untrustworthy expressions, speaks of their attempts to
get the better of each other. These figures and many
like them are set in a grey atmosphere, overhung by
leaden skies; the surroundings are drab houses, and a
muddy street.</p>
   <p><figure id="fig.003" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00003"><head>
THE PAVILION AT "LORD'S"
   Sketch from the Grand Stand.</head></figure></p>
   <p>It is an unlovely crowd in an unlovely environment;
and this is the view they take of it who see only the
mud-coloured stripes that run throughout the whole
mosaic of London.</p>
   <p>Take another point of view. Here is a young
officer, very young, and fresh as a public-school boy;
he is vicious neither by inclination nor habits. He
comes of a good stock, which is as much as to say, in
London parlance, that he " knows every one " ; he has
money in his pocket, and gets away from his rather
dreary station for a day or so in London. It is summer,
and he plays polo at Hurlingham or Ranelagh surrounded
by the fairest Englishwomen, exquisitely
dressed; he dines in private houses where the appointments
are perfect, the guests entertaining, beautiful, witty,
or clever, at any rate never dull. He goes to the first
night at a theatre where he sees a play by a well-known
playwright. In the stalls some of the most notable men
and women in England are pointed out to him, and all









<pb id="p.7"  n="7"/>
the time he is surrounded by an atmosphere of comfort
from which mud, dirt, and the rough edge of life are
carefully excluded. He has in the interspaces of other
amusements, one of the best clubs in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> open to
him, where the difficulty is to find that crumpled rose-leaf
that so enhances appreciation.  After the theatre or the
music hall he may go to the Carlton with a party for
supper. Here are the best-dressed women in Europe.
At that table not far off a cabinet minister is supping
with a party, beyond him is a man whom England calls
her finest general. The women are all beautiful or have,
what is more attractive than beauty, distinction. The
soft swish of silk and satin, the delicate yet audacious
combinations of colour in the gowns, the priceless laces,
the scintillating jewels; the atmosphere of the right
warmth, with just a suggestion of scent; the music
which blends with conversation; the menu chosen by
the highest connoisseur in London-that is to say in the
world, and the noiseless waiting; all form a picture
appealing to every sense, and soothing all. The young
soldier goes back to his barracks, and the mental picture
of London he carries with him is one of flashing
radiance; the rubies have been his portion.</p>
  <p> The gold of London is apparent to those whose
tastes are cultivated, who are literary, artistic, scientific,
or musical. In London are to be found the men who
are at the top of their professions, celebrated authors,
artists, and musicians. Even without being aught but a
nonentity it is open to all to hear the best music composed
by men famed all the world over, to see the great masterpieces





<pb id="p.8"  n="8"/>

 of painting, to attend lectures by the men who
are in the vanguard of science. Priceless objects of art,
rare books, ancient treasures, are open free for the
inspection of the poorest; these things are the real gold
of the richest city in the world. Yet some find it in
the evidences of wealth so apparent in what is called the
season. In Hyde Park on a summer afternoon, a triple
and quadruple line of carriages stretches for a mile or
more from Hyde Park Corner upwards, and were the
occupants to sit on golden seats they could not proclaim
their wealth more certainly. The pair of roans champing
their bits with haughty pride are almost priceless,
and they are not exceptional, carriage after carriage in
its admirable appointments speaks of money; this is
one detail by which to measure the wealth of London.
The Opera on a gala night may claim to rank equally,
so far as display goes, for here is a "dream of fair
women," exquisitely clothed and sparkling with jewellery
difficult to estimate in terms of money; these women
are born to wealth, and live on swansdown.</p><p><figure id="fig.004" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00004"><head>
GREEN PARK
</head></figure></p>
 <p>But what of the dark lines that run throughout the
pattern, culminating here and there in black patches
of terrible poverty, or of vice with or without the
accompanying poverty ? These lines and patches are
very obvious. Of the darker side of vice this is not
the place to speak, but it is well known; the lines of
poverty are not generally so much noticed. Take this
one, for instance, and follow it out. Stand outside the
gates of the Green Park at 4.30 A.M. It is a raw
November morning without wind, and all traffic is for








<pb id="p.9"  n="9"/>


  a while at rest. Near at hand may be heard in the
  darkness hoarse breathing, and many a husky cough,
  which, if it emanated from any of those you love, would
  madden you with anxiety. Then there is the grinding
  of a key in the lock, the opening of a gate, and that
  wretched sodden handful of men and women who have
  paced the wet pavements all night, with the command to
  "move on" breaking in on any intermittent slumbers,
  pass through into the wide green spaces where permission
  to sleep is graciously accorded them. Sleep ! What
  mockery; with the dawn of a damp winter morning
  enwalling them round, with the terrible darkness of
  the sky for a ceiling overhead; with the soaking, tufted
  grass for mattress upon a bed of sodden soil. For
  furniture in this vast bedroom, a few dripping trees, and
  soaked seats. What could one want more ? If it were
  summer the weary ones would fling themselves in all
  attitudes on the grass, looking like bundles of old
  clothes, and lie there half the day, men and women alike,
  until maybe the sun had put a little reviving life into
  their chill bodies. But in winter even those stiff and
  tired limbs decline the inviting "bed," and prefer the
  hard wooden seat, which does not strike so chill to
  rheumatic bones, and sitting there at an angle, which
  ensures with perfect certainty a cricked neck, the
  miserable, empty, ill-clad creatures sleep in sheer exhaustion
  until the rumble of the omnibuses in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName>
has long been heard; sleep until the sun is well risen, a
  disc of burnished copper against a sky of solid slate;
sleep until the string of brisk clerks of both sexes tramp



<pb id="p.10"  n="10"/>

along the diagonal path which crosses the wide green
space. These outcasts, when they at length bestir themselves,
make a rough toilet in the park in view of all the
world. There the women shake out their battered,
shapeless hats, and wipe their faces with a dirty bit of
rag, smoothing their tangled shreds of hair with their
hands. There may be seen a man, in a faded green coat,
tying the bit of knotted string that holds his "boot"
together. They are pulling themselves up to face once
more the infinity of days that stretches before them.
 </p><p>

<p>  Then they sally forth to " pick over" the refuse of
the dust-bins, and find therein treasures. They may
be seen any morning before the dust-carts have removed
the contents of those prim, cylindrical zinc receptacles
on which the British householder prides himself. These
grim, gaunt creatures, never young and never very old,
prowling around with furtive air, turning over filth that
makes a decent man sick to look at, and grasping at the
revolting details to carry them away. Take as a specimen
this one drawn from life, a small man with a woolly
black beard and matted hair, who shuffles along in a
pair of enormous flat boots that turn up at the toes and
look as if they had no feet in them. His trousers are
split at the seams and hang in tatters touching the
ground, in places they are caked with ancient mud;
his coat is of many shades of weather-worn green,
bulging at the pockets with the treasure-trove found in
the dust heaps, and hangs at the back in rags, showing
several linings; the man is a human kite living on offal,
and degraded inexpressibly.</p>








<pb n="11" id="p.11"/>

  <p> In the neighbourhood of<placeName key=" Shaftesbury Avenue"> Shaftesbury Avenue</placeName>, about
nine o'clock there may often be seen an irregular army
of shabby men, worn and pinched with hunger, scattering
to the right and left across the roadway; these are the
rejected of the men who give out sandwich boards;
they have been unable to obtain a " job" even of the
lowest sort, others have been preferred before them.
These instances are but lines and threads of that blackness
that is woven throughout the pattern. It needs
the vocabulary of a Carlyle to describe London, so we
will end with straight-spoken Thomas:-</p>
 <p> London City, with all its houses, palaces, steam-engines,
cathedrals, and huge immeasurable traffic and tumult. What
is it but a Thought, but millions of Thoughts made into one;
a huge immeasurable Spirit of a Thought, embodied in brick,
in iron, smoke, dust, palaces, parliaments, hackney-coaches,
Katherine Docks, and the rest of it !</p>

<p>A RAILING accusation has been brought against this
our famous city that she has no colour; no colour, not
figuratively speaking but actually, no colour like the
brilliant tones that make harmonies of the meanest
streets in Japan, or such as the clear air reveals in
every fabric and texture in Paris. Of all unfounded
accusations this is the most untenable ! Colour we have
in quantity, crude in startling variety, strewn along
our streets, and about our parks and open spaces;
colour on the hoardings and in the shops, colour massed
in the baskets of the flower women, colour in the neverending
procession of brilliant-hued omnibuses that pass
along our streets.</p>
   <p>This much must be in all honesty granted, but altering
   the point of the indictment it may be asserted
querulously that this colour is to be found only on
mean objects of a common sort, and is not worthy of
mention. What then of the boasted colour of Japan ?
Is it made of gold and precious stones ? Where lies it
but in lanterns and paper walls, in screens and fans of





 <pb id="p.16"  n="16"/>
the flimsiest, veritable child's toys? What gives the
gorgeousness to these slight textures and materials is
the warm living atmosphere, sunlight pouring down in
a golden flood that enriches even paper until its very
flimsiness and transparency become valuable assets in
its colour-producing properties, by giving it that transparent
glow to be seen in a wild rose growing on a hedge,
never on that same wild rose in a room. Granted is
the brilliance of the sunlight; our sunlight is comparatively
pale at the best; we are never bathed in
amber; but we have an atmosphere of our own as
wonderful in its colour effects as sunlight itself, and
bringing forth pictures of hues as superior to mere
clarity as a Turner is to a prim pastel.<figure id="fig.006" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00006"><head>THE APPROACH TO WESTMINSTER</head></figure></p>
  <p> Look now on this picture, and see it for once with eyes
cleared of prejudice, or the mist that grows of long
looking, and acknowledge it beautiful. <placeName key="Regent Street">Regent Street </placeName>
on a winter's evening when the lights are lit, and the
shops not yet closed.  The street is wet, of course;
it has been raining; and the lights flash on the wet
harness of the brown-flanked horses, and on the waterproof
capes of their drivers. The very roadway is a
living river of light and colour, for each swiftly moving
lamp, be it yellow or red or white or green, sends a
flashing, swaying pyramid behind it or before, to mingle
and interlace with other pyramids. Darting hither and
thither above this rippling river are the fireflies from
which the flashes emanate, moving to and fro,
crossing and recrossing in a mystic maze. Here and
there their continuity is broken by a broad band of










<pb id="p.17"  n="17"/>
startling colour as an omnibus heaves itself into the
wide reflection of the electric lights of a gay shopwindow
a band of colour seen an instant and gone.</p>
  <p> This brilliant vision is lined on each side by founts
of colour. Here are displayed, behind protecting glass,
fabrics fresh as flowers in their tints; and here is a
flower shop with a wealth of scarlet poinsettias resting
near a bank of violets; " deep tulips dashed with fiery
dew"; a loose bunch of giant chrysanthemums in
amber and terra-cotta, gorgeous anemones make spots
of blood-red amid their green, contrasting with the
sulphur-yellow fronds of mimosa; if the time be ever
so little into the New Year garlands of pink roses and
brilliant daffodils will be mingled with the rest; and the
whole is banked by green and white.   In the other
division of the same shop fruit is displayed, the purple
and gold of grapes and oranges contrasting with red
and green apples in piles, while deeply tinted apricots
and downy peaches rest against the greeny purple of
fresh figs. In another window near at hand flashes a
marvellous arrangement of sequin-covered gowns in
Prussian blue, crimson, and silver; they vie in their
coruscating light with the contents of a window filled
with admirable paste ornaments, set off by turquoise
and white velvet.  A  great confectioner's near has
the daintiest arrangement of heliotrope and eau-de-nil,
upon which sweets of every variety and device lie in
silver-lined trays. These items might be multiplied
indefinitely.</p>
   <p>I granted just now that London street colour is


<pb id="p.18"  n="18"/>


ofttimes crude; it lacks the tender tones and shades
of Japan, and this is noticeably true of the omnibuses.
It may be due to the colour-blind condition of a large
percentage of our population. We have omnibuses of
orange and vermilion and green and blue, but we have
no intermediate tones, no purple or primrose, magenta
or rose pink. Our omnibus managers, be it presumed,
are business men, they work to suit the public taste;
when the bolder and simpler colours are exhausted, and
it is desired to put a new line of omnibuses on the streets,
what does the manager do ? Start a new colour ? Not
at all. He knows that to the man in the street crimson
and vermilion are both simply "red," and that therein
would result confusion. So he varies his colours, by
the device of a stripe, white upon green, red upon
chocolate, and so on, and adds greatly to the gay aspect
of the streets in so doing, but fails to educate the public
taste one whit.</p>
    <p><figure id="fig.007" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00007"><head>
HAY BARGES LYING OFF THE HORSEFERRY AT WESTMINSTER</head></figure>In lines of omnibuses at present running I can recall
 of simple colours, blue, green, orange, red, white, and
 chocolate; and of mixed colours, white upon blue (if
 white may for the moment be granted as a variation in
 colour), upon green, and upon red; red upon green,
 and blue, and yellow; blue upon chocolate, and upon
 red; also red upon yellow.</p>
     <p>In regard to this same colour-blindness has it not
  often seemed that it must be a matter of education

to the untrained mind all tones of blue, from turquoise
to indigo, even including purple, are blue only. Some
time ago it was the fashion to carry out one line of
colour throughout a costume; if the dress were trimmed
with blue or brown, the hat must show items of blue or
brown also, hence the terrible falsities of colour seen
on the hat of the street girl whose "Reckitt" blue
skirt positively shrieked at her peacock blue bow. Now
it has dawned upon that same girl, whose education
consists wholly in imitation of those above her, that
contrasts are fashionable, hence she adopts a violently
puce hat with velvet of moss green reposing on it, for
has she not seen some well-dressed woman in a becoming costume of indigo and emerald?  And to her,
blue and green of all shades and tones are merely blue
and green.</p>
   <p>Let us consider now for a while those atmospheric
effects of which we make such a proud boast; there is
little possibility of exhausting the subject. The atmosphere
of London is a soft ashen grey that refines all
outlines, and forbids all crude black patches. This is
seen at its best on a clear frosty morning, when the sun
is apparently scarce twenty yards above the horizon,
when the zenith is clear blue, pale, but deepening every
moment, and the sides of the great dome drop downwards
to ashen grey. Stand in an open space like that
at Hyde Park Corner, and look across to the leafless trees
in the Green Park. Around and about the interlacing
boughs the shadows are all of tender shades of grey,
so soft, so artistic, that they melt and fade imperceptibly





<pb id="p.20"  n="20"/>

into one another, while the vistas hold the greyness as if
it were a tangible substance. This surprising atmosphere
is often overlooked, for it is so inseparable from the
object it enfolds, that it is not easily noticed. But go
to one of our black northern towns where there is nothing
of the same sort, where blacks and hard browns are the
predominating characteristics, and you will be amazed
by the contrast with this elusive atmosphere of London,
so beautiful, so gentle, but so unobtrusive.     Go, if
you like, to Kensington Gardens, and see this tender
grey enclosed by the overarching branches of the trees
in the Broad Walk; here it is unbroken, untouched, and
easily noticed.  To it are due the principal tones in
the London streets in the daytime. <placeName key="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square </placeName>,
apart from its ever-moving traffic, is a delicate harmony
of olive tints, pearl greys, and drabs. Our principal
  buildings are mostly grey and drab. Heine's description
  of London, besides being offensive, is inaccurate.
  He says :</p>
     <p><quote rend="blockquote">I anticipated great palaces, and saw nothing but mere small
  houses. . . . These houses of brick, owing to the damp atmosphere
  and coal smoke, are all of a uniform colour, that is to
  say, of a brown olive green, and are all of the same style of building,
  generally two or three windows wide, three stories high, and
  finished above with small red tiles, which remind one of newly
  extracted bleeding teeth, while the broad and accurately squared
  streets, which these houses form, seem to be bordered by endlessly
  long barracks.

  Red brick has only recently come into fashion again.
  In the precincts of <placeName key="Sloane Street">Sloane Street </placeName> it may be seen, and in
  some new buildings made of pinkish brick faced with
  Bath stone, but it does not form a noticeable element in
  our streets ; Portland stone has ever been the favourite
  material, with its leprous white patches and deep indigo
  stains showing up like shadows on the surface, as in the
  recesses on <placeName key="St. Paul's Cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</placeName>. The National Gallery,
  nearly all Wren's churches, the Law Courts, the great
  buildings in the City, such as the Bank of England, and
  many another are of this material. The yellowish olive
  tinge of limestone is not so fascinating, yet is to be seen
  very frequently; its chief exponent being the Houses
of Parliament. Stucco is frankly ugly, especially the
smooth drab variety, and too many of our buildings
date unfortunately from the era when stucco spelt
gentility. Yet after all, taken in with the grey and
the olive, it has its appointed place in the street vistas.</p>
 <p>  Carlyle's account of London is better than Heine's:</p>
 <p> <quote rend="blockquote"> All lies behind me like an ... infinite potter's furnace sea of
smoke, with steeples, domes, gilt crosses, high black architecture
swimming in it, really beautiful to look at from some knolltop
while the sun shines on it . . . some half dozen miles out
the monster is quite buried, its smoke rising like a great dusky-coloured
mountain melting into the infinite clear sky.</quote></p>
 <p>  We have seen a street at night; let us take one at
mid-day, the Strand for choice. Here the hoardings
are very conspicuous in places, owing to the great
alteration that is going  on; they make sheets of
colour, giant picture-books covering an appreciable part





 <pb id="p.22"  n="22"/>


of an acre of space; and in most cases, though ablaze
with colour, they strike no offensive note but rather
the reverse, some among them being positively artistic.
The omnibuses in the roadway no longer flash in and
out as seen by lamplight, but make two moving continuous
ribbons on each side of the roadway. Added
to their own proper colours, there is the gamboge of
the wheels and bodies, the raw terra-cotta or yellow-ochre
of the seats; and with the advertisements hedging
them around with every variegated hue and diverscoloured
lettering, on the whole it may be admitted that
they are not only gay but positively gaudy. Flecked
here and there in the moving crowd is the dominant note
of government in a scarlet pillar box, or postal van.
A blue-bloused lad darts hither and thither under the
very noses of the chestnut horses in pursuit of his roadscraping
work. Here glitters a bicycle; there a group
  of flower women are making a perfect garden with their
  baskets of yellow daffodils, cream-tinted and pink roses,
  violets here as elsewhere, pearl-white lilies lying in
  sheaths of delicate green, brilliant scarlet anemones, and
  deep rich brown wallflowers. Throughout the traffic
  in the roadway are the spinning wheels of the hansoms
  picked out in blue and red. It may be that a man
  with frail coloured balloons stands by the kerb, and his
  shimmering wares hover like gigantic bubbles on their
  pole. The newspaper placards, green and orange, lie
  scattered in the roadway, or form aprons for yelling
  boys. Among other touches that add here and there
  to the gaiety of the streets may be mentioned the green

 <pb id="p.23"  n="23"/>


cab shelters with their flower boxes and the sandwichmen
with their many-hued boards.</p>
  <p> And the people themselves, that swaying, eddying
crowd, hurrying this way and that, threading, interlacing,
with exactly as much seeming consistency and motive as
ants in an ant-hill, do they add nothing to the scene in
the way of colour? Well, it must be confessed, not
much. Occasionally there may be a glint of colour in a
hat or a blouse, or the lining of a coat swinging open, to
strike one note more in the great colour opera of the eye;
but in the main they are sombre, clad in blacks and
browns and greys, and often in the olive greens that
harmonise with much of the background. As a nation we
do not patronise bright colours freely ; our climate does
not permit it. The frequent rain and the liquid brown
mud are disastrous to rich or light hues; we want something
that does not " show the dirt."  It is only carriage
folk and those who throng the parks in fashionable hours
who can afford brilliance, and they are not in evidence in
the streets. Even the children are not gay; beyond a
scarlet tam o' shanter or a blue muffler, they add little
to the colour scheme, and to find brightly dressed
children we must go to that strange foreign quarter in
Soho where two out of every three persons passed in
the street are talking French or Italian. Heredity, or a
reminiscence of a sunnier, drier land, outweighs considerations
of economy here, and a black-eyed, brown-faced mite in a
crushed strawberry coat with a blue tam
o' shanter and a yellow muffler, or a little lad in blue
knickers, brown velveteen coat, and scarlet cap, is not an


<pb id="p.24"  n="24"/>



uncommon sight. Here are a few instances taken at
random from a cursory glance into the street: a little
girl in a puce dress, white pinafore, and striped red-and-green
woolly cap, with a light blue bow; another in a
turquoise frock, white pinafore, and navy cap with a
scarlet feather stuck in it; a third in magenta frock and
blue cap, with a bow of scarlet ribbon; another in a
much-soiled pink frock, eau-de-nil coat, and turquoise
cap, and such instances might be multiplied indefinitely.</p>
 <p> <figure id="fig.009" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00009"><head>THE SOUTH FORESHORE OF THE POOL
    FROM THE TOWER BRIDGE</head></figure>Speaking of the parks, where the fashionable world is
seen to advantage at its own times and seasons, it must
be admitted that here colour is at all events rightly
appreciated, though most of us are too work-a-day to
use it. At no time during the last century could one
have seen a crowd more daringly or brilliantly attired.
To be assured of it, go to the fashionable tea place near
the bridge over the Serpentine at five o'clock on a fine
summer day. There the gayest of striped awnings and
great Japanese umbrellas shade a number of dainty and
audacious colour schemes, which even a Japanese crowd
could not excel. Apple green and turquoise blue,
  heliotrope and amber, pale pink and purple, are only a
  few among those that strike the sight; no combination
  remains unsought by those who follow no machine-made
  laws but judge by the eye alone, if it may be risked.
  The sunshades in themselves are a flower garden, with
  fluttering petals of old rose, and daintily interwoven
  shades. At the other end of the great expanse of open
  space, near <placeName key="Hyde Park Corner">Hyde Park Corner</placeName>, in the spring, what
  masses of colour may be found in banks of rhododendron,

  deep crimson, salmon, white and pink forming a
 background to the gay crowds who gather for church
 parade, though it is true this parade is somewhat fallen
 from its former popularity. The beds of laid-out
 flowers by<persName key=" Park Lane "> Park Lane </persName>show colour at all seasons of the
 year, and here colour design is followed in the interweaving
 patterns of the bulbous plants.</p>
 <p>  Let us go from one extreme of the social scale to the
other, from the heights of fashion to the depths of " the
nether world." The Rembrandtesque effects of light and
shade, of colour and costume, belonging to lower London
have often been described, but almost always in connection
with the East End. There is, however, no need to
go to the East End to find such scenes, for the West can
hold its own. Beyond the highly respectable neighbourhood
of South Kensington, beyond the less fashionable
but still popular district of Earl's Court, there lies a
road called the North End Road. Visit this on a
Saturday night, and all the colours on your palette will
hardly suffice to do the scene justice. The butchers
shops are in their glory, and attract scores of workingclass
women on the look-out for a "tasty bit" for
Sunday's dinner.  The crude vermilion of the meat
rising tier above tier is illumined by flaring gas jets, and
breaks with wild effect on the blazing blue of the
butcher's apron as he stands at one end, elevated on a
block and shouting with all his might; for here whoso
makes the most noise gets the most custom. As likely
as not he may be decorated with a huge wreath of
chrysanthemums hung around his brawny chest, as if he

<pb id="p.26"  n="26"/>

himself were about to play the r&#x00F4;le of sacrificial ox.
The clothes of all the people who block the roadway and
line the side-walks are black, but this only serves to set
off the brightness of the stalls that line the street from
end to end in a double row. The flaring naphtha lights
hiss and glow on the fruit barrows festooned with
bunches of pale green and purple grapes. Below are
spread out in attractive array richly tinted oranges,
ruddy apples, and shining red tomatoes; there are
yellow bananas in clusters, and pomegranates, laid open
and showing purple-red in gashes; tufted celery and
terra-cotta carrots complete the picture, and this stall is
only one among a dozen similar ones. On another stall
near by are shell-fish; pink shrimps in piles, mussels,
whelks, and sea snails. Beyond this bunches of blue and
red tam o' shanters are clustered like the fruit of some
Gargantuan plant, and children's pinafores, pink and
white, with " lengths " of blue and lilac spotted prints lie
in heaps.

predominant in the next batch of stalls; the last named
  surpassing in its exceeding pinkness all other imaginable
  material. At a corner a man waves a huge brilliantly
  coloured flag, the while he lectures to a half-amused,
  half-uncomprehending audience, while another, literally
  clothed in green and yellow and red spotted bandana
  handkerchiefs, distributes his wares by this curious form
  of self-advertisement as he goes along. And through
  it all the patient 'bus horses move step by step; they
  know it is Saturday night as well as any mortal in
  the crowd.</p>



<pb id="p.27"  n="27"/>

  <p>  So far we have dealt almost exclusively with the
 more obvious and brilliant colours, but those who
 know London, and study her every aspect as they study
 the changes of expression on the face of a dear friend,
 need no vivid contrasts, which are only adduced to
 convince the sceptic.  To these lovers of London
 the vistas she offers, apart from extraneous objects, are
 in themselves perfect in tone and colour. The Embankment
 on a spring morning is a dream of delight;
 on the one side rolls the leaden-grey river, lightened
 by ripples silver-lined, and on the farther bank rises a
 marvel in greys and drabs; buildings, yards, and wharves
 alike toned and softened by the wonderful atmosphere.
 Stretching ahead is the grey granite Embankment,
 turning a hundred sombre hues beneath the climatic
 influences. Above it, like a line of softly fluttering
 ribbon, is the line of young planes showing as tender
 a green as any on earth; to the left are the giant hotels,
 towering above a shrouded base of green, and farther on
 arise the red buildings of the Temple, old and new.</p>
 <p>  Or stand on the bridge crossing the ornamental
water in<placeName key=" St. James's Park"> St. James's Park</placeName> and face eastward; the
great Government buildings arise in silver-grey, and
the leaden water and the green tints are the same as on
the Embankment. Everything is covered with a veil
of grey as with a fairy web. Green, grey, and silver,
with olive green in shadow, these are the real tones
in the colour scheme of London. Occasionally, once
or twice in a year maybe, London wakes up to play
at being Paris. She has donned for the nonce the

<pb id="p.28"  n="28"/>
brilliantly clear atmosphere of the sister city, and looks
as if she had been washed in sparkling water during
the night. The atmosphere is clear as crystal, the
street vistas look different, and we wonder we never
noticed this and that before; every brick in the buildings
and every leaf in the parks stands out, distinct and
beautiful.  One almost holds one's breath, it is wonderful,
but it is a trick, a whim, and lasts but a very short
time. Then we go back to the London we know and
love the best, for after all it is London we want and
not Paris.</p>
    <p>We have left until the last one of the glories of
  London immortalised by the devotion of her greatest
  painter.  We shrink from the task, for how can one put
  on paper with black ink the sunsets which Turner's
  brush could hardly paint ?</p><p>

     <p>To describe sunsets in general terms is truly impossible,
     yet all who live in London, and especially those
  whose release from business sends them westward at or
  about the sunset hour in autumn, will know how the walls
  of straight, high, slate-grey houses often frame a glowing,
  diffused light in the western sky. This is seen at its best
  in the wider thoroughfares, such as the Cromwell Road.
  Half the sky is alight with glory, shading from orange
  red to palest yellow, with wisps of smoky cloud floating
  against the background.   The upper lines and
    angles of the houses are touched with gold, while the
    lower parts melt into that soft grey green so evanescent,
    so elusive, the grey-green of the short-lived
    twilight.</p>









<pb id="p.29"  n="29"/>



   <p> To see the sunset in its perfection it is necessary to
 go to one of the bridges on the river, and one such
 sunset seen from Battersea Bridge is as clearly imprinted
 on the retina as a poem learnt by heart is on
 the mind. The predominant colour was red-gold, a
 sort of smoky glory, fading at its darkest into dun, and
 rising at its lightest into primrose.  These colours
 were sketched in and emphasised by immense wisps of
 transparent cloud rising from the horizon like feathery
 columns of smoke blown hither and thither. Above,
 in a sky of clearest, palest blue swam detached and heavy
 clouds like small islands on a sea of glass; they were
 gold-lined by the glory that caught them from beneath,
 and the bays and indentations in their rugged sides
 were of a green as pale and rare as the blue sky around,
 a green probably caused by the combination of the
 yellow rays striking across the blue.</p>
   <p>The year of sunsets, however, was <date value="1883">1883</date>, the year of
the eruption of Krakatoa, when night by night skies of
blood-red were to be seen vivid and almost awful in
their grandeur.</p>

readers of this chapter we anticipate and rebut by
quoting once again the sage :-</p>

<p>To a vast number of people the City is a terra
incognita; even among those who consider that they
know London "very fairly" there are many who have
but a vague idea of the limits of the City. One lady
at least, who had lived all her life in London, believed
that anything beyond <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> was the City. To
such as these the doings of the Diamond Jubilee came
as a revelation. Many who had rarely been on the top
of an omnibus before, whose carefully sheltered lives,
spent in drawing-rooms and broughams, had never led
them beyond the Army and Navy Stores or at the
farthest <placeName key="Charing Cross Station">Charing Cross Station</placeName> on the way to the
Continent, hired private omnibuses, and from that
vantage point surveyed the City as a strange and
foreign land. The wisest started by the south side of
the river and worked back across <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>, and
who that saw that sight will ever forget it ? Lines
of green moss, wreathed with flowers and glittering
with coloured electric lights, ran on both sides; at the
north end rose the ghostly steeple of St. Magnus,


<pb id="p.34"  n="34"/>


opposite the substantial walls of the Fishmongers' Hall,
while the summit of the Monument was lost in the
darkness above.   Outlined in fire were the great
group of buildings, near the Bank, including the Royal
Exchange and the Mansion House, while the Insurance
offices near throbbed and blazed with colour; for once
the City was in festival garb.</p><p><figure id="fig.012" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00012"><head>
ST. DUNSTAN'S, FLEET STREET; LAW COURTS IN THE DISTANCE It is said that the design of the tower was suggested
     by the lantern of St. Helen's at York.</head></figure></p>

   <p> Yet those who know the City, glad though they were
 to see what she could do in the way of finery, love her
 best in everyday attire.  It is a sight of sights to go,
 on the top of an omnibus for choice, to the meeting of
 the ways, the great heart of London, at mid-day. The
 medley of traffic is perfectly controlled, no vehicle goes
 a wheel's breadth out of its own ground; the pavements
 are filled with top-hatted, hurrying men intent on the
 business of the moment, which is with most of them at
 that hour lunch; this makes a picture full of life and
 one that stimulates the blood till it runs quicker than
 its wont. On the left is the long, low building of
   the Bank, four-square, which encloses within its secret
   recesses a real garden in which real trees grow. The
   Bank is the outward and visible representation of the
   solidity and credit of England. Opposite is the great
   facade of the Royal Exchange, with flower-sellers and
   newspaper-vendors grouped in front of it; within, the
   hall rises in two stories and the walls are lined by great
   cartoons representing scenes in the history of the City.
   The first Royal Exchange was built by Sir Thomas
   Gresham  in imitation of that of the merchants of
   Antwerp. Until that time the English merchants had



<pb id="p.35"  n="35"/>

  no common place for business, but had met in Lombard
  Street haphazard, an excellent commentary on the
  English method of muddling along, which somehow
  produces as great results as if all plans had been cut and
  dried beforehand. Sir Thomas Gresham's Exchange
  was made of small blocks of Turkish hone-stones, some
  of which are incorporated into the present building. It
  bore on all its pinnacles his own crest, a grasshopper,
  and it was destroyed in the Great Fire. It was soon
  replaced, but its successor suffered the same fate, also
  perishing by fire in <date value="1838">1838</date> ; hence the present building. </p>
    <p>Besides being a place of business, the first Exchange
  was a centre for amusement and recreation. The
  citizens, who were then real citizens living in the City,
  used to walk there with their wives and daughters in
  the evenings; it formed a pleasant change from the
  fields outside the City walls. There were shops set
  thickly round "well furnished according to that time;
  for then the milliners or haberdashers in that place sold
  mouse-traps, bird-cages, shoeing-horns, lantherns, etc."
  There was an upper pawne or gallery, also well set with
  shops, where the young men bought ribbons and laces for
  their sweethearts, and flirted with the shop girls in doing
  so. The youths, the apprentices of the City, played
  football in the wide courtyard until it was forbidden by
  law.</p>
    <p>A strange place that City, very different from the
  one we now know as a place well peopled by day and
empty at night.  Have you ever been to the heart of
the City at midnight ? It is very silent. By the Bank

a few stray omnibuses on their last journey pass sleepily,
the strong, well-fed policeman goes his rounds trying
door and bolt and fastening, and inquiring if he sees
lights still in an office to make sure that it is an uncommonly
industrious partner working late, and not a
burglar intent on spoil. In the modern City the ways
are still narrow and winding, and of recent years an
enormous outburst of carved and hewn-stone ornament
has appeared on the new buildings and offices. Some
of these additions are really artistic, and show that
pains have been taken with their design, others are mere
meaningless imitations overloaded with an abundance of
ornament. But at any rate time and money have been
spent on the architecture, showing some care and love
  for this daytime habitation.<figure id="fig.013" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00013"><head>ON THE TOWER BRIDGE</head></figure></p>
     <p>In the old days men not only worked in the City,
  but lived and slept there, and knew each other as
  neighbours. Even in the eighteenth century the City
  life and the City society were still quite apart from that
  of the West End. The merchant, who was not quite
  what we call a merchant now, lived over his shop, and
  kept two or more apprentices, who did part of the
  housework, while his wife and daughters did the rest,
  with possibly the help of a kitchen-maid. On festival
  occasions, these people might go as far as Vauxhall, or
  any of the other gay resorts where fashion was wont to
  assemble, but as a rule they kept aloof. They were not
  in the fashionable set; the cut of their clothes, and
    their manners betrayed them. Clad in gowns of rich
    and sumptuous stuffs, silks of the best and cloths of the







  <pb id="p.37"  n="37"/>


most superfine, yet the style was alien to the style of
the fine ladies. They had, however, plenty of society
among themselves. They knew not the lack of money,
their table was always laden with good things, and a
City merchant's capacity for food and drink seems to
have been unlimited. In the evenings, if it were fine,
they could walk in the wide Moorfields, curtailed of
their ancient extent, it is true, but still open and farreaching.</p>
   <p>The merchant himself was a person of no small consequence;
   he had behind him generations of forebears
who had not been afraid to stand before kings. From
the days of the Plantagenets the City had had a corporate
life and a mind of its own, and when our kings were
forced to ask, humbly or otherwise, for funds " on loan "
from the City, the citizen had the whip hand. It was
in the reign of William III. that the last of these
"loans" was requested, after that the king went to the
Bank. Picture it then, this life so different from that
of our own times. The well-to-do merchant, a man of
self-respect and dignity, who acknowledged without
shame that the nobility and gentry were of a very different
class from himself, but who had no wish to mingle with
them or to cringe to them; picture his lively apprentices,
his blooming, unaffected daughters, and his good
lady, inclining early to embonpoint; the diversions
and the street scenes, the neighbourly intercourse, the
bustle without hurry. The same merchant in all
important attributes may be traced back almost as far as
the history of London extends; though his opulence


<pb id="p.38"  n="38"/>



varied with the trade of London, and he was at his
greatest in the days of trade-expansion in the time of
Queen <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. Look at him as he was before the
Fire, living in a house which for picturesqueness could
hardly be matched. " The houses were timbered with
tiled roofs; the fronts all covered with carvings painted
and gilded; there were scattered here and there substantial
stone houses." Gable ends, overhanging stories,
the pinnacles and the wood-carving, the houses not
in alignment but set each at its own angle to the
street, made vistas which to-day we should regard with
admiration, though of the sanitation in such dwellings
the less said the better. Paving was a very late improvement,
and, until after the Fire, only composed of
the rounded cobble stones still in use in some provincial
towns. There was no footway at all, and the suggestion
that a row of posts should mark off the foot traffic from
  the wheeled was a distinct innovation; the mud holes
  caused much splashing, so that to walk in the streets at
  all was a danger. At many corners there were great
  heaps of rubbish-laystalls-where every one tilted their
  refuse, and which were occasionally pitched into the
  river. To counter balance this nearly every house had
  its garden, extending over a considerable area and
  well cultivated, filled with old-fashioned, sweet-scented
  blooms, such as stocks, gillyflowers, and pinks. The
  Londoners loved their flowers and some of them had
  additional gardens on the open ground at Moorfields.<figure id="fig.014" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00014"><head>
LOOKING DOWN LUDGATE HILL FROM THE STEPS OF ST. PAUL'S</head></figure></p>
     <p> Where the Mansion House stands was formerly an
   open space in which was a pair of stocks for the punishment




  <pb id="p.39"  n="39"/>


 of evildoers.  In <date value="1282">1282</date>, Henry Waleys, sometime
Mayor, built here a market called the Stocks, where
were sold at first flesh and fish, and later various
commodities. The place prospered exceedingly, and
"the butchers of the Stokkes" several times appear in
the City chronicles. That they were kept under strict
supervision is shown by the fact that when one of the
number so far forgot himself as to attempt to sell putrid
flesh he was condemned to stand in the pillory, with the
offensive meat under his nose, an example of poetic
justice which is rare. Sir Robert Vyner put up a statue
of King Charles II. on horseback in the market at his
own expense; this was greatly admired until it was
discovered that it had originally been a statue of <persName key="John Sobieski">John Sobieski</persName>
 trampling a Turk underfoot, and that the
economical Sir Robert had bought it abroad cheaply and
had only gone to the expense of altering <persName key="John Sobieski">John</persName>'s head to
that of Charles, and the Turk's to represent Cromwell,
on whom unfortunately the sculptor had left the Turk's
turban, which led to the exposure of the fraud! The
market was removed to Farringdon Street in <date value="1757">1757</date>.</p>
  <p> Of this London, this beautiful, insanitary, picturesque,
fascinating London, we possess but few remnants, and
these we shall consider in detail presently. Of London
after the Fire there are not many good examples either,
but one such I found in a house near Billingsgate which
report says to have been Sir Christopher Wren's own
City house, though here, as frequently elsewhere, report
speaks hastily, and on insufficient premises. At any rate
we may take it that this house forms a very good




 <pb id="p.40"  n="40"/>



specimen of the kind of mansion the City merchant of
that date preferred. It is admirably proportioned, built
of red brick, with quoins and string-courses of stone.
The front door faces a yard, and has stone steps leading
up to it on each side; beneath them is a kennel for a dog.
In the hall black and white marble tiles form the
pavement; the stairs with carved balusters bear date
<date value="1670">1670</date>, that is to say, just subsequently to the Fire, when
all around lay in ashes, and the air was thick with
complaints and actions as to "meum and tuum."  However
did they settle it, we wonder, when all landmarks
were swept away ?</p>
    <p>On the first floor of this beautiful old house are four
 doors with heavily carved architraves, rich in foliage and
 fruit, in the style of Gibbons. The upper rooms have
 decorated ceilings, with heavy mouldings; in one room
 the mantelpiece and fireplace is of marble of different
 tints, and in the centre is an exquisite plaque of a
 sleeping child in relief. On the ground floor is a small
 room completely lined with oil paintings on panels
 reaching from floor to ceiling; these are dark with age,
 though in good preservation, and were painted in <date value="1696">1696</date>
 by " R. Robinson."  The ceiling here is also carved in
   wood, and though paint and varnish overlies most of the
   carving on stairs and ceilings, still one can see the care
   and the loving attention which the man who owned the
   house had given to its details.</p>
      <p>Many attempts were made by the English sovereigns
   to stop the growth of London. There were edicts
   issued against the building of houses, for it was feared



<pb id="p.41"  n="41"/>

 that the population would get beyond the control of the
authorities. The measures were taken in all good faith,
  but seem to us naive in their simplicity, for an order of a
  very different sort is now in force, that whosoever pulls
  down the houses of the poor shall erect other houses for
  them.</p>
     <p>Let us consider the gradual growth of London.
  In the very earliest days, when the importance of
  the Thames as a waterway had been noted and proved,
  the merchants settled along its banks on the site of the
  present City. Down the centre of this settlement ran
  the Wallbrook; on the west was the Fleet, and on the
  east the Lea. About the year 360 A.D. the enclosing
  wall, which played a large and important part in the
  history of London, was built; but it remains now only
  in fragments, in St. Giles's Churchyard, near All Hallows
  on the Wall, and possibly at the Tower.</p>
   <p>  Pass on six hundred years, and we find the same City
  extending over something like the same limits, though
  probably with a largely increased population. The
  houses are poor and mean, built for the most part of
  wattle and clay with a strengthening of wood. There
  are many churches; from the earliest date the City has
  been a city of churches. In <date value="1135">1135</date> this mean City was
  burnt from end to end, and was rebuilt in much better
  style. The London that arose from the ashes had schools
  and a fine trade; the citizens already had a good social
life with opportunities for recreation as well as work.
  Let us pass on another three hundred years: this brings
  us to the reign of the pious King Henry VI., and, as



 <pb id="p.42"  n="42"/>


we should expect, churches and religious houses then
abounded. The pinnacles and spires of the churches
arose in all parts of the City, and the religious houses
also cluster thickly around the walls on the outside.
Old <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>, still for many a long year the only
bridge at London, was covered with irregular houses,
and had a chapel on it, dedicated to St. Thomas of
Canterbury, a very gem of work. It was of two stories,
richly decorated, and supported by clustered columns.
On the south side of the river there were houses around
St. Mary Overies, and a line by the water-side, but
beyond that was nothing but fields.<figure id="fig.015" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00015"><head>
    FROM CANNON STREET STATION The view is taken nearly opposite the London Stone.</head></figure>
</p>
  <p> To the north stretched the Moorfields, open and
reaching up to the far heights of Highgate. The
Town ditch was still in evidence and full of water; it
needed continual cleansing year by year, and was a
source of much expense to the authorities. Complaint
was frequently made that the houses were built right
on to it, overlapping it, and that their gardens reached
down the banks; considering the repeated assurances
of the "filthy" state of the ditch we wonder at the
audacity, and immunity from germs of our predecessors !
It is difficult to think of the City as thickly set with the
houses of nobles, but so it was in the Middle Ages. In
Aldersgate lived the Earls of Northumberland, Westmoreland,
Thanet, and the Marquis of Dorchester; the
Earls of Arundel had their town house in Botolph
Lane ; the Earls of Worcester in Worcester Lane ; the
Duke of Buckingham lived on College Hill; <persName key="Edward
the Black Prince">Edward
the Black Prince</persName> was domiciled in Fish Street Hill; the







<pb id="p.43"  n="43"/>


Earls of Oxford were at one time in St. Mary Axe, and
Cromwell, Earl of Essex, in Throgmorton Street; the
Earls of Leicester were in the Old Bailey ; besides these,
scattered about within the limits of the City, were the
town houses of the Beaumonts and the Huntingdons,
the Lords Mountjoy and Berkeley, the Earls of Richmond
and of Pembroke; and the palaces of kings,
such as the Erber, Cold Harbour, Baynard's Castle,
Tower Royal, and Crosby Hall.    All these within
the narrow limits of a square mile of space.  The
parts remaining of the ancient City are very few. If
we set aside for the moment the venerable Tower and
the oldest part of the Guildhall, all there is to be seen
amounts to a few fragments. Among these is numbered
Crosby Hall, built in <date value="1466">1466</date>, which was the town house
of <persName key="Richard III">Richard III</persName>., the residence of the Lord Mayors of
London, and of Sir Thomas More. It is now turned
into a restaurant, and must be visited of course. The
stained-glass windows and the dark-painted woodwork
will make us feel we have come by mistake into some
ancient chapel. The luncheon here is largely patronised
by the more wealthy strata of the City men, also by
those having ladies as their guests, and the place is so
crowded that it is often difficult to get a seat at all. A
very short way northward is the tiny church of St. Ethelburga,
with shops projecting from its frontage; a
piscina and other details here survived the Fire. The
noble Church of St. Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside is so
intimately associated with Old London, that to be born
"within sound of Bow Bells" was once synonymous




<pb id="p.44"  n="44"/>

with being a cockney. Times have changed since then;
the great spaces of "wider London " are beyond the
sound of the sweet bells of Bow, and a present-day
Dick Whittington would have left fields far behind
him before he came within reach of their encouraging
tones. Bow Bells are still famous for their chimes, and
though the bells are not the same as in Whittington's
day they are ancient enough, having been put up in place
of those destroyed by the Fire. Unfortunately they
are seldom rung, for lack of funds. Six times a year is
the rule. Bow Steeple soars grandly, rising like a dart
that would pierce the sky, but by far the oldest parts
of the church are the Norman Chapel and crypt, which,
with those of St. Paul's and Clerkenwell, and part of
St. Bartholomew's Church, are reckoned among the
most ancient fragments of Old London remaining. <figure id="fig.016" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00016"><head>
         CHEAPSIDE Nearly opposite Bow Church, in the distance, is the
corner of Wood Street, the scene of Wordsworth's
"Reverie of Poor Susan."</head></figure>The
Chapel of St. Mary's, which lies 18 feet below the level
  of the street (a fact caused by the enormous d&#x00E9;bris of
  the Fire, and to be noted in all old City buildings), is
  Norman work, with massive, rough-hewn stone. Wren
  ran a wall through it in order to utilise these solid
  foundations for the support of his new church. At a
  very little lower level is the crypt, with some beautiful
  Norman pillars with " cushion " capitals; on one of these
  is moulding, a spear-head, a very uncommon addition in
  those days of severe simplicity. Eight hundred coffins
  are walled up in the crypt. Leaving St. Mary-le-Bow
  we may go northward to St. Giles's, Cripplegate, built in
  the fourteenth century, and though restored and repaired,
  yet to all general observation a fourteenth-century church







 <pb id="p.45"  n="45"/>


as different from Wren's churches as a heron is from
a sleek city pigeon. The side facing the street is quaint
in colouring, composed of worn stone, and brick, brown
with age. At one end rises the curious tower with an
upper story of brick. Unfortunately some charming
old houses over an entry have been done away with.
In the churchyard is a bastion of the ancient City wall,
looking wonderfully fresh and white beside the smokeblackened
ivy that grows near it. The pleasant green
sward of the churchyard is fenced in by the heavy iron
railings which line the right of way, and there is no
possibility of sitting in this quiet spot dreaming of Old
London and of <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName>, as one ought to be able to do.
If the late restoration had done away with the high
heavy railings and restored the sacred green patch to
the dreamer and the enthusiast, it would indeed have
been a restoration worth the name.</p>
   <p>Just within the Liberties of the City westward, being
in fact the first numbers in Holborn, are the ancient
Elizabethan houses beneath which runs the entrance to
Staple Inn. These have been carefully restored and,
being in good hands, may stand for many a day yet, and
as they, with Crosby Hall, are the only specimens of
Elizabethan domestic architecture remaining to us in
the City of London, well may they be cherished.</p>
   <p>There is one more pre-Fire fragment, for which we
have to go a long way, namely London Stone, set in
the south wall of St. Swithin's Church, opposite Cannon
Street railway station. No one knows the age of this
stone, or why it was first adopted as London Stone.



<pb id="p.46"  n="46"/>


Some have supposed it to be a Druidical remnant, others
the Roman milestone set up to mark the beginning of
mile measurements, others again that it was a fragment
of a large monument; or that it was the place from
which proclamations were made. At any rate, in <date value="1540">1540</date>
Jack Cade, the rebel, thought there was some particular
virtue in striking the stone as a sign of his possession
of the City, which showed that it was regarded as a
talisman. It is sadly diminished from what it was;
Stow speaks of it as a " great stone," but perhaps after
his time it was damaged in the Fire. It was placed in
its present position under a grill in <date value="1869">1869</date>, and there it
remains, a suggestive fragment for the imagination to
work upon.<figure id="fig.017" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00017"><head>
CANNON STREET-SUMMER EVENING 
The roar of the traffic is gradually quieting down as            
the City empties itself.</head></figure></p>
    <p>There are other details of ancient work preserved
 and rebuilt into later fabrics, as at St. Alphage's Church,
 and the Dutch Church in Austin Friars has walls dating
 back to the thirteenth century, but we have seen all
 the recognised parts of Old London. Of London subsequent
 to the Fire there is of course a good deal more,
 though not so much as might be supposed. Into one
 after another of Wren's churches we may wander finding
 all of the same pattern with small varieties and modifications,
 and everywhere we see the same wood-carving.
   The wide vestibules, the heavy galleries, the rectangular
   plan, and the dark woodwork make a strong family
   likeness; and though the churches are but a percentage
   of their old number, they are still very thickly set
   the modern City. The Monument is of course of the
   same date; it boasts no architectural beauty; but in









<pb id="p.47"  n="47"/>


by-streets and courts may be found beautiful bits of
Jacobean work, notably in the carved pediments above
the doors on College Hill and Laurence Pountney Hill,
pediments, heavy with foliage, fruit, and cherubs in
relief. The City was of course immensely changed by
the opening up of the two great modern streets-Cannon
Street and Queen Victoria Street. These cut through
any number of narrow passages and tiny courts, and
entirely obliterated some. The improvement was really
an improvement, as one must sadly also admit of the
new Kingsway, yet it did away with many attractive
peeps, notably one looking down Paul's Chain at St.
Paul's Churchyard to the River, framed between
irregular houses, with the red walls of St. Benet's in
what is artistically but not euphonically termed the
" middle distance."</p>
   <p>Of the modern City we have said a little already in
reference to the wonderful outburst of stone ornament,
which is of recent growth, and this is perhaps the salient
characteristic; but there are others which would strike
a stranger with almost equal force. One of these is the
tortuousness of the little streets, too narrow for two
vehicles abreast, leading into secluded courts as at
Austin Friars. Courts like these are often cul-de-sac or
else have only an alternative footway leading through
the base of some enormous hive of industry into another
street. This footway, really part of the house above,
forms a public passage for all and sundry, and re-echoes
to the clang of heels the whole of the working day.
Peering down other entries into other blind alleys, we




<pb id="p.48"  n="48"/>


may note the great window reflectors put up to take
advantage of every ray of light that filters down from
the grey strip of sky above. And yet in these narrow
alleys and dark offices an enormous amount of business
is done. City offices are not, however, by any means all
dark; several have a delightful outlook, where some
graveyard, a reminder of a long-vanished church, is still
regarded as sacred ground and remains unbuilt on; so
that its waving planes and green grass are a continual
refreshment to the eyes of those whose windows surround
it. <figure id="fig.018" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00018"><head>
  VIEW FROM THE TOWER BRIDGE

The Church of St. Magnus and <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName> in
               the distance.</head></figure>Such is the graveyard of the now demolished
church on Laurence Pountney Hill. Here are the
two beautiful old houses, already referred to, with carved
pediments, uprights and lintels of date I703 ; the
cornice is also carved, but these details are not well seen
by reason of the narrowness of the lane. Under No. 3
on this hill is the crypt of the Manor of the Rose,
the stately mansion of <persName key="Poulteney, Sir John ">Sir John Poulteney</persName>, who gave
the Cold Harbour to the Earl of Hereford for " one
rose at midsummer," from which the name is said to
have arisen.</p>
   <p>And amid the modern houses, in the modern
streets, what of the men who spend their days in the
City ? They are of course of a totally different type
from the old merchant, who was a City man through
and through; now the distinction between east and
west is broken down, as it was beginning to be in
the time of the Stuarts; it is nothing derogatory to
a man of any station and any rank to be "something
in the City," if that something be of a satisfactory









<pb id="p.49"  n="49"/>

and honest nature. Men of all classes spend their days
in the City and send their sons there after a university
education. In the evening they go back to a social life
of any kind whatever up to the highest.  Of course,
with so wide a gamut the type must vary. The man
who has got together a small business, and who is in
himself but little above the better tradesman, is very far
removed from the partner in an old-established business,
himself a gentleman and well connected. It is impossible
to generalise too freely, but the same life, the rubbing
shoulders, the give and take, and the community of
interest produce some characteristics which may be set
down without straining the generalisation too far. The
City man as a rule is alert and shrewd, with an air of
good-fellowship, or at least the desire to give that
impression; he is pleasant, tolerant, and trustworthy.
At his best and at his worst he is of course a very
different being. At his best courteous, dignified, yet
good-natured, at his worst a sycophant with greasy,
ingratiating manners, who mistakes familiarity for ease,
slyness for shrewdness, and taking a mean advantage
for business ability. A creature of this sort has his
lair as a rule in the underground basement of one of
the huge modern buildings, where hundreds of offices
are collected under one roof. Here, in a tiny box of a
room, top-lighted and furnished with a couple of shabby
chairs, a few reference books and a " ledger," he dictates
to some poor typist girl, at fifteen, or even twelve,
shillings a week, the letters and advertisements by which
he hopes to lure flies into his web.</p>






<pb id="p.50"  n="50"/>


 <p> The City may be divided roughly into zones, each
with its special types. Westward, in the district about
and near St. Paul's Churchyard, are the great warehouses,
to which may or may not be attached manufactories in
the provincial towns; in many of these the clerks dine
"in," and the stores of Honey Lane market are ransacked
by the caterers to provide beef and mutton
enough. About the Bank and Stock Exchange are,
as might be expected, the offices of the stockbrokers
and jobbers; with these the tendency is to go northward
towards Finsbury Circus, but never south of Cornhill;
near the appropriately named Australian Avenue
are colonial warehousemen; down about Mincing Lane
are the merchants. The shipping offices may be said
to have headquarters along Fenchurch Street, while in
Thames Street the river is lined by wharfingers, and interspersed
amid all the districts are innumerable odd
offices dealing with every variety of commerce known
to man.<figure id="fig.019" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00019"><head>
ST. PAUL'S AND LUDGATE HILL</head></figure>
</p>
   <p> Among the men who work in the City, by far the
  largest proportion are the clerks; in the same way that
  there are numbers of privates to one officer, so each City
  man who is the head of a firm represents a greater
  or less number of clerks.  The status of the clerks
  varies a good deal with the business of their employers.
  Those who are in the warehouse businesses have a
  chance of rising to the very top of the tree, becoming
  partners and eventually retiring to a "place in the
  country," there to found a family; and even short of
  this the incomes are in some cases enormous. There








<pb id="p.51"  n="51"/>


is many a Dick Whittington who, beginning with the
modest ten shillings a week of an office boy, has found
his income running into thousands of pounds yearly,
after diligent and steady work. In many, many cases
the managing clerk has gradually got the business into
his own hands by reason of the slackness of attendance
and carelessness of his principal. He is then master
of the situation and able to make his own terms. Take
him at his best, the City clerk is a good fellow, methodical,
industrious, cheerful, and inclined to have a genuine
pride in "our office," and to rate the advantages
of his employment high. He probably lives out at
Camberwell or Peckham or some other suburb easily
reached from <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>. If he be a bachelor, he
makes his small stipend go wonderfully far. He is
always well dressed, is never seen to fail in the immaculateness
of his collar, and probably owns a bicycle. He
shares to a large extent in the qualities which are the
result of his environment. First, he is tolerant: " live
and let live" is his unspoken motto; life would be
unbearable if he strove to mould the heterogeneous
crowd with which he comes in contact to his own views,
and to be annoyed at trifles would result in a perpetual
state of irritation; therefore he goes his own way and
interferes with no one else. This attitude of mind
carries with it a corresponding defect-there is more
tolerance of evil as well as of mere divergence of
opinion, less rigid principle and less keenness in holding
opinions than there used to be.</p>
   <p>The number of clerks who find time to play at


<pb id="p.52"  n="52"/>



dominoes for half the afternoon is something amazing.
They go to and fro on business, and are not accountable
for every minute of their time; so long as the work is
done no inquiries are made, therefore it is that between
two and four on any day but Saturday they may frequently
be seen deep in a contest of dominoes in some restaurant.
The average clerk is independent also, and does not
mind showing it; bound in office hours to give obedience,
which he does cheerfully-is it not reckoned in his
pay ?-he yet holds his independence sturdily. Were all
the partners and the senior clerks to be suddenly incapacitated
he would cheerfully assume all responsibility
for the conduct of affairs until the arrival of a higher
authority. He is secretly quite persuaded of his own
ability to "run the show" better than his chief.  In
fact sometimes the difficulty is to check what becomes
officiousness; in the language of Korah and his company
he "takes too much upon him."   His willingness to
take responsibility, however, is a large asset in his
character, not often drawn upon, but well worth the
endurance of self-assertion and cheekiness, which goes
with it. It is said that Germans make better clerks
as machines, they work harder, take less pay, and
are neater than Englishmen, but they will not take
  responsibility.  It is true that real responsibility is
  not often demanded of a clerk, but the fact of his
  willingness to take it in small matters as in large
  makes him worth extra money to his employer.
  Initiative is a much rarer and correspondingly more
  valuable quality than willingness to take responsibility;




 <pb id="p.53"  n="53"/>


perhaps there was never a time when this commodity
was so eagerly sought and    so highly paid.   For
a hundred men who will use judgment and discretion
in business, there is only one who will make
suggestions and initiate reforms, in fact get his head
above the rut. These qualities are more often seen in
" travellers" than in ordinary clerks, for the business of
a "traveller" cultivates initiative; hence it has been
more than once that a large commercial firm has taken
a " traveller " into partnership sooner than a more highly
paid clerk of longer service.</p>
   <p>The girl clerks or typists are rapidly increasing in
the City, and are, as a whole, eminently trustworthy; they
show strength in the very qualities in which women
might be supposed to be deficient, as in reticence,
regularity, and perseverance. They are frequently of a
higher social class than the men clerks, and are treated
by the latter with courtesy. But there is not much
intermingling out of office hours. The wide scattering
to all suburbs, east, north, and south, that follows the
day's work is against social intercourse; men and girls
alike have frequently only just time to catch their trains,
and then they are carried away miles from each other
until they appear again at the office next morning, when
routine and discipline forbid any but the barest human
intercourse. A City clerk is in fact very hard beset to
find "ladies"' society; he may live in rooms by himself,
rooms to which he only returns late at night, and
his brother clerks, possibly similarly situated, are far
away; there is none of the mutual interchange of sisters


 <pb id="p.54"  n="54"/>



that makes for marriages in a country town. Many and
many a young fellow goes from week's end to week's
end associating only with other men. To remedy
this state of affairs the late Professor Shuttleworth
organised a club which proved a brilliant success. It
is a club for both City men and City women, and
includes many recreations, such as concerts and dances,
and is run upon sensible and sound lines. The club
has prospered marvellously, and so many have been the
marriages resulting from it that the professor used to be
chaffed upon his " matrimonial agency."

  <p> But any account of the City, however general and
discursive, would be incomplete without a reference to
the king of the City, the Lord Mayor, and his court of
aldermen and sheriffs. The Lord Mayor is a very
great personage indeed, his office was established in
<persName key="Richard I">Richard I</persName>.'s reign, though never acknowledged by
Richard. The glory of Lord Mayor's show has
unfortunately sadly fallen off since the days of the City
giants and the pageantry, or from the time of the river
f&#x00EA;tes and the splendid barges, and seems likely to decline
still further, till it becomes a mere procession with bands
and State carriages. Yet the Lord Mayor still meets
the Sovereign on State occasions at Temple Bar, and hands
him the keys of the City, and no royal person from
abroad feels satisfied that he has really seen London
until he has been received by the Lord Mayor. The
great civic dinners of the City are not at all diminished
in grandeur, and the menus of some of them would
  make a bygone merchant open his eyes, though he







<pb id="p.55"  n="55"/>

might think our ideas of delicacies for the table as
strange as we think his "prunes in soup, honey poured
over roast mutton, pigeons stuffed with green gooseberries,
and turkey with cloves." The City Companies
too keep up their reputation in this respect, and any
one who has partaken of the hospitality at one of the
Halls will not soon forget it. It is the custom on these
occasions to entertain men only, and as well as offering
a profusion of good fare to send each guest away with
a present, of what the Americans call "candies," the
French "bonbons," and for which we use the unsatisfactory
word "sweets"; doubtless intended as a reminder
to the wife at home that though of inferior
degree, not worthy to partake of a City Company's
dinner, she is kindly remembered.</p>
   <p>The Companies' Halls are in themselves in many
cases interesting and, in some cases, ancient, that is to say,
since the Fire. The carving and the pictures and the
plate are worth seeing, and, though the number of the
companies has diminished, they make a brave show, from
the lordly Goldsmiths, Mercers, and Drapers down to
the humble Tallow Chandlers.</p>

</p>

<pb id="p.59"  n="59"/>


<p>THE reader need not fear that he will be led into a
dissertation on the architectural excellences or enormities
of our public buildings; these shall be left aside,
and, save as it occurs incidentally, architecture shall not
be so much as mentioned in what follows. There are
many books treating of our great national buildings, and
therein may be found details that do not lie within the
scope of our present discursive narrative.</p>
<p>   The two great Churches of St. Paul and St. Peter are
of course the two buildings that stand out pre-eminently
in London, by reason of their tradition of antiquity and
their sacred character; of the two the Abbey comes
in for the largest share of attention from  foreigners
and visitors. A stranger able to see but one would
undoubtedly choose the Abbey, because in many points
it has the advantage of St. Paul's; the points easily
noticeable are the fact that it is the crowning-place
of our sovereigns, and connected with all the State
pageantry of these occasions; that it is a much older
building than St. Paul's; and that it has always been



<pb id="p.60"  n="60"/>


the burial-place of those whom the nation " delights to
honour."</p>
  <p> The coronations make a magnificent record: a
procession of kings from <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</persName> to
<persName key="Edward VII">Edward VII</persName>., with every variation of dress and detail, but
always the same great ceremony, a tradition momentous
enough to throw a feeling of solemnity over the most
flippant mind.</p>
  <p> The principal personages who took part in these
coronation ceremonies no doubt each seemed final unto
themselves, the embodiment of the present, and had the
idea firmly fixed in their minds that now had arrived the
great event for which time had been hastening onward,
now was a ceremony eclipsing all that had yet been.</p>
  <p> From the time when the monks lived on the island of
brambles but slightly above the level of the water and
easily overflowed, hard by the ford at which the pilgrims
and the travellers from north and south crossed the river,
before even the building of <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>, the ground
whereon the Abbey stands has been sacred ground.
Thus the second point is conceded; as a building also
we may grant it to be intrinsically more interesting
than St. Paul's by yielding to it the palm in age.</p>
  <p> <figure id="fig.022" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00022"><head>THE BRIDGE AT WESTMINSTER</head></figure><placeName key="Edward the Confessor's Abbey">Edward the Confessor's Abbey</placeName> was in the Norman
 style, crowned by a cupola of wood, and the whole
 occupied almost as great an area as the present Abbey.
 Of this little now remains, and as successive kings were
 crowned, the Abbey altered in size and shape, always
 retaining some of the ancient work while new was added,
 until it attained its present grandeur by the slow growth










 <pb id="p.61"  n="61"/>


of centuries. This it is that gives it its charm, dates are
written in stones and style as surely as geological periods
in different strata, and the ages of the cathedral may be
gauged definitely by inspection; here are the stones of
<persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</persName>, there the work contributed by
<persName key="Edward I">Edward I</persName>.</p>
   <p><persName key="Richard II">Richard II</persName>. did his share : in the reign of Henry VII.
was built the magnificent chapel still known by his name,
and Wren's two Western Towers complete the architectural cycle.</p>
   <p>On the third count St. Paul's yields again, for though
there are names whose glory is second to none buried
there, yet <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> is in a peculiar sense the National
Valhalla, the Hall of Heroes, and her aisles are crowded
thickly with notable names as well as those considerably
less notable, and but for their presence here already
forgotten. Among Kings and Queens, this is the burialplace
of<persName key="Edward the Confessor"> Edward the Confessor</persName>; of the I., III., and VI.
Edwards; of <persName key="Richard II">Richard II</persName>.; of Henry V., VII., and VIII.;
both the <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.; <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.; the two Queen Marys
and their unhappy sister of Scotland; <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and
Anne, both remembered with love and gratitude though
they were the antithesis in character; <persName key="William III">William III</persName>.;
and George II. Of statesmen, soldiers, poets, and
authors; of artists, historians, and men of science, the
names are legion; were <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> to have no other
title to our love and veneration than these mighty
names of the past, it would still occupy a high place.
The very air is thick with memories; it is impossible
for the eye to rest anywhere without encountering





<pb id="p.62"  n="62"/>

some memorial of the great past. Yet granted all
this, granted the points enumerated, still in the minds
of many Londoners, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> takes a place second
to St. Paul's.</p>
   <p>The reason for this is difficult to find, but shall be
entered upon presently. Before leaving <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
it is well to notice its external beauties, and the points
of view from which it can best be seen. Coming up
Victoria Street on a night when the moon is high overhead,
the ghostly and glorious outlines of Wren's two
Western Towers can be seen at their best, with all their
beautiful stonework, their pinnacles and niches traced as
in ivory.</p><p>
<figure id="fig.023" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00023"><head>THE END OF VICTORIA STREET,
       WESTMINSTER</head></figure>

</p>
   <p>A view less known and full of detail is that from
the front of the House of Lords, where every fretted
pinnacle of Henry VII.'s chapel is shown in relief,
where the platform for the intended spire is full in
view and many an angle and turret, and where the
white outlines of St. Margaret's are in the background.
This is perhaps the finest sight of all. From the river
again, where those two fretted towers rise grandly,
and the Abbey seems to crouch like a lion behind the
Houses of Parliament, it is beautiful also; at every
point, down every vista, something may be seen that
cannot be attained in any other way. For dignity the
ancient Abbey is unapproachable, it needs no spire to
call attention to its merits; though it is long-backed,
somewhat squat in its dimensions, unequal in its
parts, it bears in every line the impress of its growth
throughout the ages.</p>


 <pb id="p.63"  n="63"/>

  <p> The services in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, beautiful as they are,
lack something; it may be that the monuments piled in
every available space, or the dust of ages lying thickly,
deaden and muffle the sound of sweet singing; it may
be the peculiar construction of the interior, where the
transepts are occupied by the worshippers, who thus
sit across the cathedral, and do not see the long nave;
or the feeling of having the choir on the wrong side;
from one or other of these causes, or all combined,
there is never the perfect satisfaction about a service in
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> that there is in St. Paul's. </p>
  <p>Who that has sat beneath St. Paul's mighty dome and
heard the grand hymn-</p>
              <p><quote rend="blockquote"> 0 God, our help in ages past,
</quote>
sung by the full choir with the deep notes of hundreds
of voices, each in themselves of small compass, but
fervent in utterance, can forget it ? St. Paul's is the
national church in a way that <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> can never be,
and the feeling that she inspires is a deep sense of
citizenship. Yet this is strange, because the style of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, the Pointed or Early English, is far more
national than the classical outlines of St. Paul's.  From
the vast dome that rears itself high over the surrounding
houses, to the mighty nave in which the very atmosphere
of London is enclosed, St. Paul's strikes a note of our
nation. <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> has its coronations, St. Paul's its
thanksgiving processions, and though, with the exception
of the Jubilee celebrations, these cannot compare with
the coronations for pageantry, they touch sometimes

<pb id="p.64"  n="64"/>

another note, not reverence only, but glad thanksgiving.</p>
   <p>The present cathedral is due to Wren, who-though
to strengthen the foundations he altered the axis of the
church-built on the site of the old cathedral, first
founded, according to Bede, in 604. There are no
remnants of Old St. Paul's except some monuments and
the foundations of the Chapter House, uncovered on
the south side.<figure id="fig.024" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00024"><head>BLACKFRIARS REACH FROM WATERLOO
            BRIDGE</head></figure></p>
   <p>The Sunday afternoon services, as at present held,
bear witness that faith is not dead among us. There,
gathered together, Sunday by Sunday, may be found a
great crowd of all ages and both sexes, mostly of the
middle classes, the comfortably off, comfortably clad
people, who keep up a tradition of honest living and
hard work, with respectability among us. It is a
wonderful sight: the grey distances, the dimness of the
towering dome, the long-drawn aisles, and the crowd
soberly dressed in black, and brown and dingy colours;
a crowd reverent, attentive, joining a service that for
singing and music can hardly be surpassed.  The
boys' voices of St. Paul's are well known for their
beauty; wandering down the narrow streets of the
neighbourhood on a week day you may chance to hear
a song sweeter than any lark's, a boy's clear treble,
rising higher and higher, until you catch your breath to
listen as the fresh young voice goes up, up, lending
wings to the soul; and suddenly with its cessation you
come back into a very work-a-day world, a world of
hurrying people, of huge carts, of crowded omnibuses,









<pb id="p.65"  n="65"/>

of muddy streets and grey skies; a world filled with
the essence of the commonplace, from which you
had been carried away by the practising notes of one
of the choir boys of St. Paul's in the school hard by
the cathedral.</p>
   <p>To return to the congregation, why is it that the
commonplace crowd appeals to us so ? Is it because of
the love of humanity that beats in our veins ? Is it
because we feel that here, in the mass of men and women,
are the characteristics to which none of us are strangers,
and that, therefore, if these characteristics could by a
miracle become visible, and the excrescences of personal
idiosyncrasies be taken away, the remnant would be those
feelings and qualities common to all ? In fact that we
should see humanity in the abstract?  It is difficult to
express the idea in words, but to those who feel this
responsive beat St. Paul's appeals with force.  It utters
the voiceless cry of those who cannot speak for themselves;
it embodies the national ideals. It is the uplifting
of those who toil and those who think. The same
crowd that gathers in St. Paul's on a Sunday afternoon
may be seen any day in the Underground trains about six
o'clock, men and women soberly dressed, hard working,
keenly alive; intelligent men and women who have
opinions and character, who are selfish, imperfect, grasping,
and unclean, but who yet have ideals, and with
more or less ardour strive to live up to them; who
are rarely destitute of self-respect and independence;
who form the large majority of Londoners,
outnumbering all other classes by ten to one, and who



<pb id="p.66"  n="66"/>


make the "wheels go round."     From   them, when
successful, spring the aristocrats of the future, the landed
proprietors, the great commercial princes, the peers;
from them, if unsuccessful, come the scavengers and
scamps, the wastrels and worse. Always it goes on,
this falling and rising, without cessation, and yet like
a lake into which a river flows in and flows out, the
bulk of the commonplace remains the same.</p>
  <p> But we have gone far from St. Paul's. Of its past
there are two pictures on which I like to dwell. One
is Paul's Cross, with its eager fanatics preaching to an
excited crowd, to those who held their religion dear
enough to go to the stake and brave the fire for it.</p>
   <p><figure id="fig.025" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00025"><head>
SOUTHWARK BRIDGE AND ST. PAUL'S
          CATHEDRAL</head></figure>The exact site of the Cross has been ascertained.
The old cathedral was not exactly on the same site as
the present one, but, to use an expressive word, was
"skewed" round a little, and the north-east angle of
the present cathedral cuts the spot where stood the Cross
of St. Paul. It was of unknown antiquity, and in early
days folkmotes were gathered here, and later proclamations
of all kinds were issued from it, so as to
make it, as Dean Milman says, " the pulpit . . . almost
of the Church of England." This pulpit was occupied
by men whose names will last as long as English history
lasts, Ridley, Latimer, Gardiner, Coverdale, Laud, etc.,
who were attended by vast crowds and eagerly
heard.</p>
   <p>From the time when jousts and tournaments were
held in Smithfield, and even hard by in Chepe itself,
to the time when first one doctrine and then another










 <pb id="p.67"  n="67"/>


 found utterance according to the tenets of the reigning
 sovereign, through that era when fire and stake claimed
 many victims, when religion was not a theory to be
 aired on Sundays in company with respectability, but
 a living, pregnant thing that might bring forth any
 day death by torture, on to the time of the civil wars,
 when, by order of Parliament in <date value="1643">1643</date>, it was pulled
 down, Paul's Cross was the scene of the discussion
 of all the burning questions of the day. The stones
 around were trodden by an innumerable multitude of
 men of all ages seeking light. Picture it if you can,
 this company of the ghosts of the past. Where now
 you sit on a hard-backed seat and your eyes rest on
 brilliant green grass, where flocks of opal-hued pigeons
 bill and coo, where plane-trees wave gracefully and the
 roar of the traffic comes gently subdued; these crowds
 ran to and fro, now gathering together and anon turning
 away for discussion; eyes sought eyes with fear that
 said, " We also are in danger," and the very crackling
 of the faggots seemed to rise on the still air as all that
 great assemblage hung upon the words of the preacher.</p>
  <p> We have several prints of Paul's Cross, one very fine,
in which the old cathedral is shown in the background
with its flying buttresses and square tower, shorn of the
spire, which was burnt in <date value="1561">1561</date>. Against the wall is
a sort of grand stand or canopy, where King James I.,
his Queen, and his son Charles are seated.  In the
foreground are many people decorously sitting in rows,
while a few gallants in cloaks loiter about behind them;
one man whips a dog that makes his presence too


<pb id="p.68"  n="68"/>


obtrusive, and others lead away a couple of horses,
possibly those that have brought the King to listen to
the Bishop of London, <persName key="King, Dr. John ">Dr. John King</persName>.</p>
   <p>
<figure id="fig.026" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00026"><head>
INTERIOR OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S
     BEFORE RESTORATION</head></figure>One more scene that always haunts St. Paul's, that
of the time when it was turned into a house of shopkeepers.
St. Paul's aisle in the sixteenth century was
the regular meeting-place for merchants who wished
to discuss business, gallants who wished to be in the
fashion, and those who had assignations. " The south
alley for usurye and poperye; the north for simony and
the horse fair, in the midst for all kinds of bargains,
meetings, brawlings, murthers, conspiracies."  The
centre walk or "Pervyse" was a lounge for idlers
and wits, gallants and cheats. Bishop Corbet says:-
"When I past Paul's and travell'd in that walk where
all our Britaine sinners sweare and talk," and Captain
Bobadil in Every Man in His Humour is described as
a "Paul's man," otherwise a loiterer and roysterer.
It was also a thoroughfare, porters bearing burdens
frequently came in at the north door and crossed out
by the south; beside bookshops there were tobacco
shops and "semsters "; such a den of thieves is almost
incredible, and that this sacrilege was suffered to go on
speaks badly for the powers that were. A curious
custom was that the choir boys had the right to demand
a fee from any one entering the cathedral during service
time with spurs on; "the boys will swarm     about
you like so many white butterflies; when you in the
open quire shall draw forth a perfumed embroidered
purse . . . and quoit silver into the boys' hands."







 <pb id="p.69"  n="69"/>

A delightful training in decorum and reverence for the
youngsters!</p>
   <p>In the time of the Fire all the booksellers of
Paternoster Row hastened to place their stores in St.
Paul's for safe custody, but the stores were burnt with
the cathedral. Of all glimpses of St. Paul's, that where
it comes suddenly upon you as you pass westward up
Cheapside, and the towering dome appears unexpectedly
high overhead above the green trees, where the tones of
the building run the gamut from indigo to ash-grey, is
the most striking. A much better known but less
striking view is that of the approach by Fleet Street,
where the height of the dome is measured by the
pointed spire of St. Dunstan's.</p>
   <p>We have lingered long enough over the two great
churches, and must note, even if only to mention them,
other buildings. Of these there is one other church
that every Londoner should know, St. Bartholomew's
the Great, hard by Smithfield, where Norman work is
to be seen in its full beauty. This church is only a
fragment, the choir, in fact, of the old Priory Church
of St. Bartholomew built in <date value="1123">1123</date>. Across the water is
another priory church, that of St. Mary Overies, now
known as St. Saviour's, and here some remnants of the
earliest building may be seen, though a great deal of the
fabric is modern.</p>
   <p>Of entirely new ecclesiastical buildings the magnificent
   Roman Catholic cathedral in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> is a
striking example; the style Byzantine, carried out in
red brick, is alien to the spirit of the Londoner, as is

<pb id="p.70"  n="70"/>



also the towering campanile, which he is apt to liken
to a mill chimney. But none the less, in spite of the
half-concealed aversion which leads him to mistrust
anything to which he is not accustomed, he is bound to
confess that seldom has a finer building been raised for
the worship of God in his own age; for, with the
exception of Truro Cathedral, we have ceased to build
these mighty worship-houses, trusting to those already
in existence through the piety of our ancestors.</p>
   <p><figure id="fig.027" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00027"><head>      ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S SQUARE

The site of the old Smithfield Cattle Market. St.
Bartholomew's Hospital and the spire of St. Sepulchre
are the chief landmarks.</head></figure>London has many Palaces, but the first example,
first because the London residence of the King,
Buckingham Palace, hardly deserves the name at all,
being merely a large mansion of stucco, well described
in the favourite auctioneer's term "commodious."  Of
St. James's, with its quaint courts, its Tudor clock-tower,
and its lovable red brick, we shall speak again. We
could linger long about St. James's, picturing many
scenes, from the touching farewell between that most
loving father, Charles I., and his young children, to the
time of the hated Georges, when fat and rude George I.
dragged poor Lady Nithisdale half across the great
reception-room, as she caught at the skirts of his coat
while on her knees before him imploring for the life of
her husband. It was in St. James's Palace that the
unhappy child destined to be known as the Pretender
was born, and here died clever little Queen Caroline, by
far the best of the consorts of the Georges. Lev&#x00E9;es
are still held at St. James's, though drawing-rooms take
place at Buckingham Palace.</p>
   <p>Kensington Palace speaks still more loudly of the








<pb id="p.71"  n="71"/>


Georges; though it was bought and rebuilt by William
III., who suffered from asthma, and was persuaded that
the " gravel pits " of Kensington were good for that complaint.
The view of Kensington Palace usually seen, that
from the Park, is not striking, it appears but a uniform
building of a dull-coloured brick; to see it to advantage
it is necessary to pass to the long semi-private road
that skirts the west side, and there it is transformed
into a heterogeneous medley of red-tiled, creeper-covered
brick buildings standing amid green fields, a
group that might be a hundred miles away in the
country; with all the reposeful look so delightful in
the midst of a busy world. Queen Anne spent most of
her time at Kensington Palace, after her accession,
living a lonely, dull life; bereft of her husband and
children, and without sufficient brains to care for reading,
it is hardly wonderful that she succumbed to apoplexy,
brought on by too liberal an indulgence in the pleasures
of the table. Her negative virtues at all events earned
her the title of "good."</p>
   <p>Far beyond Kensington, on the outskirts of the
London that now is, lies the Palace of Fulham, the
official residence of the Bishops of London. Situated as
it is, easy transit by water was first among its advantages,
and the older bishops in their splendid barges passed
up and down the river in the ordinary course of the
day's work, for long and dangerous country roads,
boggy and miry and " infested by footpads," lay between
them and the old Cities of London and <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.
Even so late as the eighteenth century, the Earl of


<pb id="p.72"  n="72"/>


Peterborough, who had a house, a country house of
course, in what is now the New King's Road, was
stopped by footpads on his way to it and robbed; one
at least of the robbers was caught, and turned out to be
a student of the Temple, who had done this thing not

     Moonrise.</head></figure>One of the courtyards at Fulham Palace dates from
the reign of Henry VII., and there are few places that
preserve more completely their ancient aspect. Red
brick and creepers as usual form the two main elements
in the scene, and the fine gateway tower adds character
to the long, comparatively low, wings. Other parts of
the Palace, like so much elsewhere, have been spoilt by
the rebuilding of a later age. At the present time the
question whether the See of London can afford to keep
up the Palace has been mooted, and the voices of those
who would pull asunder all links of continuity with the
past, who would rob London life of all that reminds us
of our historical record, and would tear down all save
that which is strictly utilitarian, are sure to be loudly
heard. But the day when the Bishop deserts Fulham
Palace will be one of blackness to those who love
their London and would preserve her scanty relics
of the past, even at the cost of a little additional
expense.</p>
    <p>From Fulham to Lambeth we may go bywater, though
 unless we have a private steam-launch or boat we shall
 not in these days, these boasted days, find so much as a
 wherry to take us there. It is down stream, however,









<pb id="p.73"  n="73"/>


so unless against the tide the work of rowing will not
be arduous.</p>
   <p>Lambeth is a monument of venerable dignity and far
less known than it should be, because, though easily
accessible, it stands upon what to London, in general,
is the wrong side of the water. It has been the
dwelling of the archbishops since the days of Archbishop
Fitzwalter in <date value="1197">1197</date>, who proposed at first to found here
a college for canons, but being opposed by the Pope,
founded a town-house for the See of Canterbury instead.
The great gateway at Lambeth is the finest of those
remaining from the Tudor period, it is bold and high
with battlements and towers, red brick and white stone
being the materials used. The part of the palace used
by the archbishops for their living-house dates only
from the beginning of the nineteenth century. The
Lollards' Tower is of grey stone and abuts from the
chapel. It had formerly an image of St. Thomas %agrave;
Becket in the niche in its walls, to which the watermen
of former days would touch their caps in passing. The
crypt in the chapel is supposed to be one of the oldest
parts, dating from the original building by Fitzwalter.
During the time of the Commonwealth the soldiers, out
of hatred for Laud, broke into the chapel and destroyed
the stained-glass windows, and subsequently the palace
was used as a prison, as it had been frequentlyused before;
later still it was sold, and the chapel for the time turned
into a dancing-room. Such was the reign of the godly
Cromwell. It was afterwards restored and rebuilt.</p>

Whitehall we speak in the chapter on <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,

one of the greatest of our Queens that it cannot be
passed over.</p>

The twin towers of the Hospital in the distance.</head></figure>This is <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>, so far off that it can hardly rank
as London, though it lies within the limits of our Greater
London of to-day.</p>
   <p>When the first royal palace of <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> was built
we have no record, but that there was a royal residence
here in the time of <persName key="Edward I">Edward I</persName>. is stated by Lysons.
The best-known view is that of "Placentia," the
palace of Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, to whom the
land had been granted by Henry VI., and this, though
altered and having its front rebuilt by succeeding sovereigns,
became a royal palace after Duke Humphrey's
death.   Henry VIII. was born at <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> and
was very fond of residing here. Here were born
also Mary and <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, and here died the poor little
King <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. The glory of <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> reached its
height in the reign of Queen <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, who gave
splendid entertainments at the palace, and occupied it
in preference to any of her other residences. Charles II.
ordered it to be taken down, and began rebuilding,
though lack of funds caused the work soon to cease.
Queen Mary II., inspired by the example of <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>,
made it one of her dearest wishes to see a fine home for
seamen built on the site of the ancient palace, and
after her death her husband carried out her wishes, but
the seamen ceased to live within the building in <date value="1869">1869</date>,
when the scheme was changed, and the pensioners





 <pb id="p.75"  n="75"/>



received pensions in money, and went to live with
their friends. The Royal Naval School was opened
instead in <date value="1873">1873</date>.</p>
   <p>The fine frontage and the domes of Wren's building
are well seen from the river, and the great painted hall,
decorated by Thornhill, attracts many visitors. Wren's
design was given freely as a magnificent contribution
to the great scheme.    Though <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> retains
some parts of Charles II.'s work and that of other
sovereigns, it has none of the real flavour of antiquity;
it is splendid, but romance seems to have departed from
it, and it does not kindle feelings of enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> Of the great public buildings not yet described the
first in rank is of course the Tower. The arrangements
have been so much improved of late years that it is now
quite possible for the visitor to attain some idea of the
plan of a first-rate medieval fortress.  It is still a
barrack and a store for artillery, but all the older parts
are open to view, and we wander as we will over the
site of the palace and its garden, or through the grim
prison-like passages and halls of the keep and its chapel.
We note that, till the modern doorways were made, the
entrance must have been by a ladder, and what look
like dungeons were the royal apartments of the Conqueror
and his family.  The inscriptions in some of
the flanking towers are of a single period, but the
Tower as a prison is only one of the three aspects in
which the building should be studied. When we know
it as a palace, as a fortress, and as a prison, we are
presented with its modern phase and find it a most



<pb id="p.76"  n="76"/>


interesting, well arranged, and carefully labelled museum.
But we have seen museums elsewhere. It is outside, on
the grass, under the trees, or by the river's edge that
we love to linger. About the whole place there is an
air of sleepy quiet. Perhaps the voices of the officers
drilling soldiers in the moat rise sharply; the rumble of
a great dray over the cobble stones comes softened by
distance; the shrill scream of a tug in the river cuts
the air like a knife; but these are items which only
serve to measure the general sense of stillness. Go to
the front of the Tower on the quay; here at any time
on a fine day the seats will be full of people, who sit
there indolently enjoying without analysis the general
sense of well-being that the scene imparts.   The
swiftly flowing water below probably brings up with it a
whiff of salt from the sea. Beneath the quay whereon
we sit flowed the water to the moat, and here came
in those who entered by the Traitors' Gate, and who
had little hope in those grim days that justice would
fight expediency to the victory. <figure id="fig.030" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00030"><head>THE TOWER OF LONDON</head></figure></p>
<p> The grey walls of the turreted White Tower peep
over the brown bricks and fixed walls of the Lieutenant's
lodging, and in front is the fresh green of a strip of
vivid grass.</p>
  <p>  Go over the drawbridge, and pass under the portcullis
  of Bloody Tower-which deserves its name if
 ever a place did so-and seated on Tower Green wait
 until the spirit of the place has enfolded you. Apart
 from its historical interest, which is of course paramount,
 there is another interest that appeals with potency to






<pb id="p.77"  n="77"/>


some, and this is the fact that those whose impatience
had been dulled by long-deferred hope to a quiet resignation;
those whose bitter tears became fewer as the
inevitable end approached; whose beating hearts had
grown so used to the grim spectre of fear that he had
become almost a friend, were nearly all of culture and
of birth. Queens, princes, princesses, nobles, and men
of learning and of piety, the salt of the earth, were they
who suffered here. This is no common gaol, but little
did they who endured the long imprisonment and
ignominious end imagine that instead of infamy they
had earned glory, that in times to come their names
would be classed in a hierarchy of the noblest of England.</p>
  <p> In the beautiful Chapel of St. Peter to the north,
every stone in the chancel and aisle covers the dust of
some murdered man or woman. As Macaulay says,
"there is no sadder spot on earth than this little
cemetery." Here are buried two queens, Anne Boleyn
and Katharine Howard; Lady Jane Grey, who, from
the range of building to the south of the Beauchamp
Tower, saw her husband's headless body brought back
in a cart; Devereux, Earl of Essex; Margaret,
Countess of Salisbury. All these were executed on
Tower Green on the railed-in space before us, then
covered with green grass, now paved with rough cobble
stones and gently shaded by young planes. In the
chapel also lie the Duke of Monmouth and the Scots
Lords, brought here from Tower Hill. As Stow
quaintly wrote, in the days when the Earl of Essex, the
last of the six persons beheaded in the Tower from


<pb id="p.78"  n="78"/>


<dateRange from="1536" to="1601">1536 to 1601</dateRange>, had but just suffered, "There lyeth
before the High Altar, two Dukes between two Queens,
to wit the Duke of Somerset and Duke of Northumberland
between Queen Anne and Queen Katharine, all
four beheaded."</p>
   <p>Modern barracks occupy part of the space within
the walls, and in the centre rises sternly and splendidly
the White Tower. Its facings of Portland stone, due to
Wren, have added to its appearance, so that we do not
grumble at the change; the interior is as grim and
gloomy as in the days when it was first built as a house
of defence and a strong tower. The narrow, winding
staircase connecting battlements through many stories to
vast vaults underground for storage; the well for water;
and the secret access to the moat, all prove it capable of
being held without difficulty by those besieged, and the
walls, thirty feet thick in parts, promised ill for the
success of any besiegers that should surmount the moat
and wall outside to attack it at close quarters.</p>
   <p>St. John's beautiful Norman chapel, with its double
crypts; and the airless, lightless cells-one well named
with a strange, jesting humour, " Little Ease "-though
slightly changed in small details still carry one's mind
back through the centuries.<figure id="fig.031" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00031"><head>THE WATERWAY TO LONDON FROM
  ABOVE CHERRY GARDEN PIER</head></figure></p>
   <p>What is supposed to be part of the old Roman City
wall stands near the White Tower, and from here a
fine view of the Tower Bridge gives one of those peeps
which are found in abundance about the Tower. Its
charm lies in its heterogeneity, its unexpectedness, its
mixture of styles, its marks of growth; he who would







 <pb id="p.79"  n="79"/>


know the Tower well would have to live there many
a day.</p>
   <p>After the Tower all other buildings seem small and
uninteresting, yet the Guildhall, which has existed since
the earliest corporate existence of London, has a dignity
of its own, in spite of what Mr. Wheatley calls the
" mongrel substitute" of the frontage put up in <date value="1789">1789</date>.
This is the only part of the building generally seen, and
is far from lacking beauty, with its delightful irregularity
of design and the whiteness of its Portland stone. The
walls of the great Hall date from the rebuilding of <date value="1411">1411</date>,
and the roof, a modern addition but of oak in the
hammer-beam   style, cost  &#x00A3;100,000.  The crypt is
probably the part least seen, and yet, from an architectural
point of view, it is infinitely the most interesting.
It dates from <date value="1411">1411</date> also, and from each pillar spring
sixteen ribs to form the groins, a curious and almost
unique design. It has been repaired, and is in good
preservation. This was not always a crypt, but was
once upon the street level, as the windows now blocked
up tell. The pavement outside is ten feet or more above
it now, for the same reason that we found in Bow Church.
The Guildhall has many memories, its courts, its City
banquets, and ceremonies being mingled with scenes of
history, of which the most memorable is the trial of
Lady Jane Grey. The Art Gallery, the Museum, and
the Library are all well known both to strangers and
citizens.</p>
   <p>The Royal Exchange, the Bank, and the Mansion
House serve to make a group, which if not beautiful


<pb id="p.80"  n="80"/>



is at all events inoffensive, and they speak of the age
of solidity in which they were erected. Associated as
they are with the wonderful and ever-varying scenes
passing continually before them, the Londoner at all
events learns to love the massive columns of the Exchange
and the long, low lines of the Bank; here if
nowhere else he feels he really is in London.</p>
   <p><figure id="fig.032" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00032"><head>HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FROM
        LAMBETH</head></figure>North-westward of the City is the hoary Charterhouse,
   where still stands the ancient gateway from which
dripped the blood of the last prior, in the reign of the
tyrant Harry.  Upon part of the grounds are the
modern and fine buildings of the Merchant Taylors'
School, for the famous Charterhouse School, which
includes in its roll the names of Wesley, Thackeray,
Leech, and others, is removed into the country. The
old pensioners, gowned and well cared for, spend peaceful
days in this strange backwater, separated only from
the rushing tide of traffic in the Clerkenwell Road by
an ancient wall on which fig-trees grow. </p>

again in connection with <persName key="Dr. Johnson">Dr. Johnson</persName>. It is the only
ancient gate left standing across a street in London.
It formed the entrance to the priory of St. John of
Jerusalem, and the offices of the re-established Order of

<p> Among other public buildings to be mentioned are
the Houses of Parliament, forming a well-known river
view,-I mean the view from the east, where the bridge
draws a line across the front, and the towers rise
behind a foreground of barges and rippling water; and






<pb id="p.81"  n="81"/>

if this view is seen set against the smoky splendour
of a sunset sky, its beauty is enhanced tenfold. The
glory of the Houses of Parliament is <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
Hall, built by William Rufus, who designed to rebuild
altogether the old palace of <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</persName>, and
afterwards enlarged by <persName key="Richard II">Richard II</persName>. Strange scenes has
the Hall beheld, and now it stands empty, swept, and
garnished, a wide open stone space, with the feet of
continual passers-by echoing on its pavement and dying
away in the vast timbers of the ancient hammer-beam
roof. Once the empty Hall was full of life and movement;
at one end was the Court of Exchequer and at
the other the Court of Chancery and King's Bench.
Up and down amid the rabble and riff-raff that always
hang on to any law case walked men with straws in
their shoes, signifying that they were to be bought as
witnesses ! Part of the Hall was occupied with the stalls
and shops of booksellers, mathematical -instrument
makers, haberdashers and sempstresses. Many historical
trials were held here, from Sir William Wallace onward,
through those of Sir Thomas More and Queen Anne
Boleyn, to that of Warren Hastings.    Impassioned
pleading, agony of expectation, resignation or loss of
hope, the Hall has seen them all, and mingled with
them what Carlyle calls the "roaring flood of life"
passing in and out, persons cynical, humorous, callous,
and seeking opportunities for self-advancement. </p>
 <p> Besides the crypt of St. Stephen's the hall is the only
part of the ancient palace left.</p>
  <p> Of galleries and museums in London the less said

<pb id="p.82"  n="82"/>


the better. The National Gallery is adorned with the
colonnade that formerly fronted Carlton House. The
British Museum contrives to give exactly the impression
which its contents inspire,-absolute trustworthiness;
here you may find all that you can possibly want, and
any fact found is vouched for with all the tremendous
weight of official authority.  The Museum  building
says as clearly as if it were written across the frontage,
" I am the National Storehouse, and I live up to a full
sense of my responsibility."</p>

</p><p>What the new South Kensington Museum will be
remains to be seen as it sheds its scaffolding poles; it is to
be hoped that it will in some degree neutralise the effect
of the hideous Noah's Ark next to it. The Imperial
Institute, lamentably as it has failed in the purpose for
which it was intended, is externally by far the most
graceful and harmonious building in this quarter.</p>
  <p> But time fails us, of Somerset House, of Burlington
House, of the Tate Gallery, of all Wren's churches, we
would fain talk by the hour, yet such discourse might
fail to be profitable, and could not altogether fail of being
wearisome. We forbear, and leave this chapter, with the
impressions already gained of the Houses of Parliament
outlined against a glowing, smoky, sunset sky; of the
stately dome of St. Paul's rising high above the roofs and
line of quivering planes; of ancient red-brick, stonequoined
gateways; and of the mighty Tower, concrete

<p>A VISITOR from the United States of America woke up
in his hotel in Northumberland Avenue, on his first
morning in the old country, and hardly waited to do
justice to his breakfast before sallying forth to inspect
all the historical marvels of London, which exercise
such a potent fascination over the minds of those who
live in a new country.  He was in a position to inspect
these marvels with greater ease than any man before his
date, for he had brought over with him the first working
time-machine ever constructed, and by its aid he
intended to see for himself how cities are made, and to
be present at every detail of the growth. He attracted
but little attention in the street; his secret had been
well kept, or the mob would have made a fair trial
impossible; and the machine was eyed by the passers
with only a slight glance of wonder as if it had been
some new-fangled sort of motor tricycle. Quivering
with anticipation the visitor made his way to the north
side of <placeName key="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square </placeName>.<figure id="fig.035" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00035"><head>ST. MARTIN'S, TRAFALGAR SQUARE</head></figure></p>
 <p>  He saw before him the sight so familiar to us all, the



<pb id="p.86"  n="86"/>


dun pavement and the splashing fountains, the little green
trees against a background of drab stucco, and beyond
them the vista of Whitehall, where rise the towers of the
Houses of Parliament. At the north end of Trafalgar
Square were the high columns and the dome of the
National Gallery, and close at hand was the arcade of
St. Martin's Church. Early as it was, the seats in the
open space held their complement of loafers, those men
"who do nothing, and have nothing," and yet contrive
to live apparently with no small degree of comfort.
Children going to school dressed in woollen mufflers and
red caps looked furtively at each other in passing; a cab
laden with boxes made its way up <placeName key="Charing Cross Road">Charing Cross Road</placeName>
toward one of the great stations; at the corner of the
Square a couple of well-set-up stout sergeants talked
ingratiatingly with two weedy, nondescript youths;
omnibus horses struggled past them up the incline;
errand boys on small cycle carts went spinning along.
It was a students' day at the National Gallery, and
several students of both varieties, distinguishable rather
by the carelessness of their costumes than for any
special artistic taste in their arrangement, mounted the
steps; they seemed to know one another, and exchanged
greetings freely. A girls' school, leaving in its wake an
impression of peculiar giggling insipidity, passed at a
uniform march; and all these objects toned in with the
drabs and the greys and the greens of the Square.
How changed it would all be, in a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye! The visitor's hand was on the
spring. He whizzed backward through space; in the







<pb id="p.87"  n="87"/>



middle of the eighteenth century he stopped the
machine with a thump, and behold-before him
stretched a walled-in space. He was well versed in
local history, this visitor, and he needed not to be told
this was the Royal Mews; in the centre was a curious
and ancient building called Queen <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s Bath,
though with what justice it is difficult to say. The
facade of the Mews was very new and elegant, having
been rebuilt but about twenty years, and it was surmounted
by three stone cupolas. In ancient times it
had housed the king's falcons, and here were now
stabled the King's horses, the breed of cream-coloured
Hanoverians lately introduced, and the wonder of
England. The neighbourhood of the Mews was not
unfashionable. Houses had been built for the gentry
and nobility on the north side, and bowling greens
there established; but to the north-east the district was
very squalid; a perfect rookery of narrow lanes and
malodorous alleys stood there, popularly known as the
Caribbean Islands. The Church of St. Martin's was the
only object that remained the same in spite of the
visitor's incursion into time, but it was difficult to see
because of the intervening houses. It had only been
rebuilt some five-and-twenty years. Close before it ran
a narrow lane stretching down to <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>, and this
the visitor must needs follow. Here the scene was
utterly changed and was quite strange and unfamiliar.
Instead of Northumberland Avenue there was a splendid
house with a frieze of large capital letters across the
facade. The house was built round about a square

<pb id="p.88"  n="88"/>
courtyard, and the gardens, covering several acres,
reached down to the river.</p>
   <p>As he sat there surveying it, the hand of the visitor
touched the spring of the machine almost unconsciously,
and slowly he went back through the ages. In the
earlier part of the sixteenth century the house had
disappeared, and there in place of it was a small religious
house, St. Mary Rounceval. It had escaped so far the
reforming tendencies of Henry VIII., but was to be
suppressed in the reign of his son. Behind it was a
large plot of ground enclosed with brick, where the
Kings of Scotland were wont to lodge in ancient days
when they came to the Parliament of England; this
was later known as Scotland Yard. The visitor,
glancing at his time register saw that he was now in
the year <date value="1529">1529</date>, a date that enabled him to appreciate
what happened a little later.<figure id="fig.036" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00036"><head>
<placeName key="CHARING CROSS STATION">CHARING CROSS STATION</placeName> FROM THE
            RIVER</head></figure></p>
   <p>To his right, on the spot where now stands the statue
of Charles I., arose a stately cross of white Caen stone,
pure as the day it was erected in <date value="1289">1289</date>, and the model
of which we may see in <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> station yard to
this day. The condition of the pure cross drew the
stranger's attention to the difference of the atmospheric
conditions from those of the time when he had started;
behind and all around him stretched fields, and the air
was as clear as that of the country on a May morning.
To the northward there was no church, but fields only,
in the which Henry VIII. was to found, six years later,
the first Church of St. Martin's in the Fields. At
the beginning of the long, muddy country road called






 <pb id="p.89"  n="89"/>



the Strand was another small religious house, where a
few tumble-down cottages and quaint gabled houses
made up the village of Charing. Yet even then it
was a busy place. A man jogged past on a solid,
broad-backed mare ; a lad in charge of a flock of sheep
exchanged a greeting with him; an itinerant vendor,
a comely woman, singing a song of indistinguishable
words in a loud, cheery voice, made the air resound;
these and several other passers dressed in clothes of
bright colours, but in a quaint, unfamiliar style, stopped
and gazed open-mouthed at a gay cavalcade that swept
suddenly into view and turned down Whitehall.
Satisfied that he was himself totally invisible, the visitor
turned to gape also. There must have been at least
seven or eight hundred people, some on horseback,
some running on foot, and all alike dressed in shining
armour, in scarlet and in blue.  They parted just
abreast of the visitor, who saw with astonishment,
riding in the midst of them an ecclesiastic, with a strong,
heavy masculine face, magnificently mounted on a black
horse covered with trappings of crimson and gold.
The very saddle was of crimson velvet, and the man
himself so shone and glittered with precious stones that
he seemed like the sun in his rising. But Wolsey's sun
was nearly set.</p>
   <p>The cavalcade turned into a gateway of the palace
on the east side of Whitehall below Scotland Yard.
The palace was a congeries of red-brick buildings, not
unlike St. James's, but more rambling and confused;
glimpses of courts filled with eager, restless servitors


 <pb id="p.90"  n="90"/>


and men-at-arms could be descried from the rough
roadway.</p>
  <p> A sudden desire to see the end of this palace, to see
it melt and fall, seized upon the visitor, he pressed
his finger on the spring marked "forward" and came
slowly upwards toward our own time, but after a short
time he stopped and remained spell-bound. The palace
was still there though much altered and enlarged.
Recent attempts had evidently been made at renovation,
for there now stood facing the roadway a majestic
building of Portland stone in a very different style from
the old ruinous red-brick walls around it. It had a
row of windows across the frontage, and altogether it
seemed strangely familiar. Where had he seen it that
very morning ? Why, in the guide-book of course, as
a representation of the Banqueting Hall, still standing,
the only fragment that was ever executed of Inigo
Jones's great design for a new palace of Whitehall.
But as he gazed on it he noted how it was half hidden
by a great platform that rose to the lower sills of the
upper-storey windows; and on the platform there was
a man, slight and small and timid-looking, and in the
group round him were soldiers in uniform, a bishop in
full robes, and men in state dress, yet none was so
conspicuous or so dignified as that slight, small figure
partially disrobed. The waiting multitudes beneath,
hemmed in by horsemen, so that they could not reach
the scaffold, looked on with upturned faces in which awe,
anxiety, and deep dread were mingled. Presto ! The
scene had changed, the machine had slipped on, but

stopped, it seemed, almost immediately, though so fast
it went that in reality ten or eleven years had intervened.
The crowd was now gathered about the upper part of
Whitehall, where the cross had stood, and there on a
gallows erected for the purpose four of the regicides,
who had taken part in the murder of their king, were
hanged and then quartered. Faugh! with a sensation
of disgust the visitor turned away; men had coarser
stomachs in those days. He resumed his way down
toward <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, but stopped short at the sight of
the magnificent Holbein gateway standing right across
the roadway south of the palace, a gateway built by
Henry VIII. shortly after the date when the visitor
had witnessed Wolsey in his glory. It had two high
side towers, hexagonal and crowned with battlements.
Windows gemmed its sides in profusion. Every niche
was filled with carving, and the variegated brick made
a rich background. Passing through this the visitor
perceived on the left the wide spaces of the neatly-laidout
Privy Gardens, and on the right a tilting ground.
He was now confronted by a second gate with domecapped
towers, rich enough, but lacking the profuse
ornament of the first one.</p>
   <p>Passing through this he found himself in <placeName key="King Street">King Street </placeName>,
that narrow street through which all the pageantry of
royalty had to pass for many generations. Funerals
and marriages, christenings and state ceremonials had
been crowded in between those overhanging houses,
three and four storeys high, with carved work and
escutcheons and blazoned arms on their frontage. No


<pb id="p.92"  n="92"/>


attempt at any sort of pavement was there on this royal
road; large mudholes were traps for the unwary and
the depression in the centre of the roadway was filled
by a stream, into which, as he watched, women from
the adjacent houses emptied their pails; one deluge of
water, shot from an upper storey, narrowly missed his
head, and quickening his pace he was glad to find himself
in the peace of the Abbey precincts. A space of
green stretched before him and behind it rose the
Abbey, very much as we know it now, though without
Wren's two noble western towers, venerable and
dignified, with St. Margaret's Church close under its
shelter. But except for <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Hall the whole
aspect in the direction of the river was strange. On
the north side was New Palace Yard with a handsome
clock tower; from this ran houses of wealthy and
substantial merchants. On the east of it was the Star
Chamber. It stood close to a pier running out into the
river, for here there was no bridge until nearly a hundred
years later. The congeries of irregular buildings grouped
around <placeName key="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</placeName> were mean and undignified,
and numbered among them many private houses of the
same gabled overhanging style as those in King
Street.<figure id="fig.038" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00038"><head>LIGHT AFTER RAIN

</p>
   <p>The visitor knew that here had stood the great
palace occupied by our kings up to the time of the
transference to Whitehall, and he gazed in wonder,
speculating which of the buildings he now saw were the
remnants of this palace. The Chapel of St. Stephen was
apparent enough, rising high on the south; here sat




 <pb id="p.93"  n="93"/>


the House of Commons, but of the others which he
knew must still be there, the Painted Chamber and the
Court of Requests, once <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor's</persName> livingrooms, he could divine nothing, nor of the Prince's
Chamber and the Council Room, all of which vanished
later in the fatal fire of <date value="1834">1834</date>.</p>
   <p>Turning away westward somewhat sadly, the visitor
found his attention attracted by a massive and sombre
square keep of blackened stone, standing on the site of
the present Guildhall; he approached it wondering at
its windowless condition, and surmising on the darkness
within, when he realised that this must be the famous
Sanctuary, the refuge of hunted criminals, and his
attention redoubled. The little narrow, irregular, pointed
windows strongly barred, the old bastion projecting
from the straight undecorated wall, and the low doorway
riveted his attention.  Here noble and subject,
prince and pauper, the innocent and the guilty had fled
in days when retribution was swift and inquiries none too
certain. It had served its purpose, this grim citadel,
sheltering all alike until means could be found of proving
innocence or providing for escape. Twice did Queen
<persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, wife of <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>., fly here; and while within
this rough, dark dwelling the first time gave birth to
her elder boy, to be a king in name but never in fact.
Looking away from this place of dark memories the
visitor saw almost immediately another tower, like and
yet unlike the Sanctuary; like in its lack of ornament
and its plain severity of outline, but differing in that it
was a double gateway and not a solid building. The


<pb id="p.94"  n="94"/>



two gates were at right angles, one leading from Dean's
Yard, and the other being the entrance into the Abbey
precinct from the direction of Tothill. This gateway
formed a prison in two parts, on one side for the Bishop
of London's "clerks convict," and on the other for
prisoners of the City of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. Many notable
men have languished within the walls, noblest of all
Sir Walter Ralegh the night before his execution.
Hampden, Lilly, and Lovelace, the Cavalier poet, were
here also, and some thirty years after the date at which
the visitor surveyed it even the garrulous Pepys was to
spend a short time within the walls, in consequence of
having been accused of too tender a regard for the
absent James II.</p>   <p> <figure id="fig.039" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00039"><head>   WHITEHALL

              of Montagu House.</head></figure></p>
   <p>The man of the time-machine had seen nearly enough;
his brain could no longer contain all the mystery and
the wonder of this ever-changing City. Merely for the
sake of contrast he pressed the button " forward," and
found himself once more brought up sharply in the
present century on the day on which he had started.
Before him stretched Victoria Street, grim and grey,
with the asphalt shining between the precipitous houses
like a river of ice in a deep ca&#x00F1;on. Offices on every
floor and part of a floor were to be found in those tall
buildings. A motor car whizzed past, slackening speed
behind a string of omnibuses, a telegraph lad on a red
bicycle caught on to the back for a moment to balance
himself. The cabmen exchanged jokes at the cabstand
in the middle of the street. Farther on a vast modern
emporium attracted crowds of buyers, who followed



 <pb id="p.95"  n="95"/>



each other in a continuous string in at one door and
out at another.</p>
   <p>Turning down a side street, the stranger came
suddenly upon a huge cathedral in red brick, the very
latest of the ecclesiastical buildings in the Metropolis,
and then he let his machine go backward once more.
Vanished in a flying haze were the houses, the buildings,
and the streets; except for a line of picturesque almshouses
a little to the east, there was nothing but a
wide open space of green, with two large marshy ponds
enclosed in its low-lying ground.</p>
   <p>The machine ran backwards, slowly and more slowly,
and stopped suddenly at the date <date value="1256">1256</date>. The fields
were alive with people. Booths, and tents, and pavilions,
decorated with streamers and flags, occupied all the
available space. Men-at-arms hastened from one tent to
another. Pages, bearing dishes, got inextricably mixed
up with them in their hurry. The horses, a goodly
number in brilliant trappings, champed and stamped a
space apart ; all was bustle, confusion, and haste. Then
in a moment the bustle ceased, every man stood erect
and steady in his place. Two glistening lines of men-at-arms
formed a lane down which rode a gay cavalcade
of men and women on horseback, rainbow-hued, with
garments and trappings of cloth of gold, of crimson,
and azure, and as they passed not a head but was bared
before them, while a mighty shout drowned even the
fanfaronade of trumpets, and all at once there rushed
upon the visitor's mind the words of that ancient
chronicler Stow, whose writings he knew by heart. </p>



<pb id="p.96"  n="96"/>


<p> <persName key="Maunsell, John ">John Maunsell</persName> the King's Councillor and Priest, did invite
to a stately dinner the kings and queens of Scotland and England,
<persName key="Edward">Edward</persName> the king's son, and earls, barons, and knights,
the Bishop of London and several citizens, whereby his guests
did grow to such a number that his house at Totehill could
not receive them, but that he was forced to set up tents and
pavilions to receive his guests, whereof there was such a multitude
that seven hundred messes of meat did not serve for the
first dinner.</p>
  <p> With renewed interest at the thought of the goodly
company he was keeping, the visitor watched the arrival
of the royal party at a gorgeous tent set at one
end of the field. He noted the ladies as they alighted,
and marked the high pointed head-dresses and the
flowing wimples; he saw their gowns, blue and
green, red and gold, sweeping the ground in folds;
he saw the unrivalled embroidery of their cloaks,
and the inlaid armour of the men; when in his
eagerness leaning  forward  he  accidentally touched
the spring of his machine, and flick! the show had
disappeared, but in its place was another of the year
<date value="1571">1571</date>.<figure id="fig.040" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00040"><head>EMMANUEL HOSPITAL, WESTMINSTER,

   <p>There was a great space cleared, about the length
of a cricket pitch either way, and around it, raised
on platforms, as on a grand stand, were a number of
people whose high degree was evidenced by the beauty
and costliness of their costumes. Behind them, crowding
every vantage-point where a view of the cleared
space could be obtained, was a vast crowd of men and
women, soldiers and lads, jostling each other in their





<pb id="p.97"  n="97"/>


excitement. The pushing increased tenfold when, from
  a tent of gaily striped awnings, there stepped forth a
  man dressed in crimson satin breeches, a cloak, and a
  black velvet hat with a red feather in it. He was led
  into the square, where he bowed with great ceremony,
  east, west, north, and south, and then proceeded to
  strip himself of his finery until he stood forth bare-legged
  and bare-headed before all that great assemblage.
  In front of this champion was borne a gauntlet upon a
  sword's point, and after him a long staff tipped with
  horn and a leather shield. It was evidently an ordeal by
  battle. And Stow's account of the "combat appointed
  to have been fought for a certaine manour and demaine
  lands in the Ile of Hartie adjoining the `le of Sheppie
  in Kent" came into the visitor's mind. He was to be
  the privileged beholder of one of the last cases of ordeal
  by battle. However, there seemed to be some hitch,
  for though the other combatant presently entered the
  lists with much the same ceremony as the former one,
  the battle did not begin, and this, to one so versed in
  the history of Stow, needed no interpretation; was it
  not stated that after some time when the principal or
  employer of the second man, he on whose behalf the
  combat was to take place, made no appearance, the trial
went by default to the first ? It was all clear enough:
the Lord Chief Justice, who was conducting the case,
Willed that the foremost man should "render againe"
the gauntlet to his adversary, whereupon the former
  man objected and wished to have fought all the same, so
as to have given the onlookers a show, but the second

<pb id="p.98"  n="98"/>




man not being of so pugnacious a disposition, the matter
hung fire.</p>
  <p> Somewhat tired of waiting while so much arguing
went on and such long speeches were made, which by
reason of the distance he could not hear, the visitor set
his machine forward once more.</p>                  <p>

   <p>Once again flick ! and behold a fair with booths, and
shows, and punchinellos, stalls for merchandise, and a
goodly gathering of purchasers and sightseers. The
visitor watched with interest the aspects of the fair, and
concluded that it was much the same as in our own day,
much scampering about and talking, much haggling
over prices and advertising of wares, and in all a great
running to and fro and but little done. Wearily he
turned on his machine once more, when behold! an awful
spectacle. Numbers of rough, strongly built carts laden
with dead bodies; a solemn and awful procession; a
great pit, shallow enough in all conscience, wherein the
bodies were laid in rows and rows, dressed as they were.
Even afar off, and in spite of the rags and soil stains of
their clothes, it could be seen that they were in some
sort of uniform, and this the visitor understood. He
hardly needed to glance at his dial to see the date 652,
for well he knew that these hundreds of dead men were
the prisoners who had been taken at the battle of
Worcester, and were Scotsmen, who had been brought
to London and had died in sorrow and sickness far from
their native land.  So badly buried were they that
loads of extra soil had afterwards to be laid upon the
shallow graves.</p>
<pb id="p.99"  n="99"/>

  <p>With a quick movement of the hand the visitor was
back in the present day. He had seen enough; and, a
wiser man than when he started, he made his way back
to Northumberland Avenue, with a gallery of mental
pictures in his brain.</p>

<p>
    IT is trite to recommend the top of an omnibus as
the best means of seeing London, the point is generally
  conceded, so let us concede it and get on.</p>
   <p>  The omnibus route forms the thread on which the
 pearls of old associations are conveniently strung, and
 if the route be chosen with care, the pearls be sure will
    be thickly strung.</p>
<p>Beginning at the Marble Arch we have the Edgware
   Road stretching away northward; it was part of the
   old Roman Road called Watling Street, which name
 may still be found belonging to a small street in the
City.   Watling Street did not at first run through the
City at all; it went down the line of what is now Park
Lane to the marshes at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, where it struck
the river at the ford.</p>
<p>When <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName> was first built, pilgrim and
trader alike found it preferable to go that way rather
than encounter the mists and swamps at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
with the certainty of a disagreeable plunge into the river
at the end. The course of the main highroad therefore

<pb id="p.104"  n="104"/>



was altered, and instead of passing down Tyburn
Lane (Park Lane) it followed Tyburn Road (Oxford
Street) to the City, and of the whole length of this great
highway only the small Watling Street above referred
to retains the ancient name. </p>
<p> Tyburn Lane kept on the high ground above
Tyburn stream, which ran to the river. Tyburn is
associated with the execution of criminals during many
centuries, and though the name must be familiar to all
sorts and conditions of people it is doubtful if one
Londoner in a hundred has the least idea where the
place of execution was. </p>
  <p>The gallows were put up across the end of Edgware
Road, at its junction with the Bayswater Road, and the
executions ranked high in popular favour as delightful
entertainments for rich and poor alike, entertainments
which the authorities were not niggardly in providing.
In Tudor times the sight was richer than mere hanging
could ever be, for the custom of the time permitted the
barbarity of half-hanging, and then the poor wretch,
dimly conscious, was cut down and his still faintly
palpitating heart torn from his bosom, or his limbs
severed the one from the other. To the agony of
death were added its worst horrors. Yet callousness,
doubtless springing from familiarity with such sights,
made the criminals of less sensitive mould than we are
apt to imagine. In the eighteenth century, of which
we have full and complete records, though the chopping
up and disembowelling had gone out of fashion, the
victim had to endure what to any modern youth would




 <pb id="p.105"  n="105"/>

  be the long torture of a slow procession from Newgate
     to the gallows. Apparently, however, he looked upon
  it as a triumphal procession, and would have felt himself
     defrauded of his rights had it been omitted. From
 the prison to St. Giles's, where he drank his last bowl
     of ale, from St. Giles's to Tyburn, he was accompanied
 by a singing, dancing, cheering, jeering mob, largely
made up of his fellow-associates in crime, both men and
women. What more could any one desire ? For the
  time being he was paramount, with none to dispute his
     sovereignty; even those who had slighted him as being
  a child in evil had to take a second place that day.
  Down the road he came, a king in his glory, his throne
    a jolting, springless cart, for his foot-stool his open
    coffin, beside him as attendant a priest in exhortation.
  His dying speech, a little premature maybe, but none
the worse for that, was being hawked about the crowd,
the rival vendors frequently coming to blows. It sold
    better than even the nuts and oranges and other
    delicacies retailed in profusion. Incidents there lacked
    not; the road was miry, totally unmade in fact according
to our notions; sometimes one wheel went deep into a
mud-hole, the coffin was nearly flung off the cart with
the jolt, and the gaolers and attendants had to put their
shoulders to the wheel to send it flying outward and
onward. Children were held up by their parents to see
   the victim, young women climbed on carts and stands,
 and   kissed their hands to him; men madly jostled each
 other to get a better view. We are told that 200,000
 persons witnessed the execution of the famous Jack



 <pb id="p.106"  n="106"/>



Sheppard, who was only a boy of twenty-two at the time
of his death, but this was a mere handful compared
with the crowd that attended Jonathan Wild six months
later to the same end, and Jonathan Wild, execrated by
authorities and mob alike, cannot be supposed to have
enjoyed his procession.</p>
   <p>Arrived at Tyburn, the young man who was to " make
a public holiday" saw a much more respectable crowd
awaiting him. Where the Marble Arch now is stood a
grand stand or scaffolding of wood, where seats were
let at a price, and in tiers above tiers rose the heads of
the gentility. The balconies, close to the gallows, were
occupied by the sheriffs and a favoured few.</p>
  <p> The last execution at Tyburn was in November <date value="1783">1783</date>,
and then the scene was transferred to Newgate, but it was
not until 868 that executions took place in private. </p>

  <p> If we go down Park Lane and, changing omnibuses
at Hyde Park Corner, pass along <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName>, we encompass
on two sides the aristocratic district of Mayfair,
which came into prominence about the end of the
seventeenth century, when Berkeley Square was built,
while Hyde Park Corner was still the end of the world so
far as Londoners were concerned. Mayfair bears a very
apparent significance; the fair in which it had its origin
was granted in James II.'s reign, and was held during
the first fifteen days of May, and, though fallen into
disrepute, was not abolished until the end of the
eighteenth century. <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName>, long simply " the road
to Reding," is now lined by palatial clubs. The old tale
that the depression in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> which causes the bus
horses so much effort is due to the selfishness of a
magnate, who had the ground hollowed out in order to
improve the view from his house windows, is absurd.
The depression is somewhere about the place where ran
the Tyburn stream above referred to, and is a natural
conformation of the ground. Beyond it we rise on to
a line of heights whose steep slopes may be marked down
the Haymarket and lower part of <placeName key="Regent Street">Regent Street </placeName>. Few
indeed are the lovers of London who can pass down
<placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> without admiration. In the springtime, from
the great open spaces at Hyde Park Corner one looks
along a vista of tree-bordered park, and the line of grey,
irregular buildings; no slavish conformity here as in
Nash's ideal, <placeName key="Regent Street">Regent Street </placeName>. Or at night, coming westward,
 when the lights, topaz and white and ruby, flash
from the other side of the Park like a brilliant necklet

of jewels of intricate pattern, when the roadway before
us, seen to perfection by that onerous dip, is covered
with flitting lights, and over all the great white arc
lights shed a soft radiance, one feels that that indescribable
fascination, never to be put into words, is about us and
around us in its full force. In imitation of the joyous
country girl, who, getting a whiff of the Underground,
exclaimed with enthusiasm, "Oh, how lovely! Now
I really feel the Season," we cry, "Oh, how lovely!

 <p>  Near <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> Circus stood the Gaming House in
which so many persons lost not only their own fortunes
but those entrusted to them. We have preserved for
us a pitiful picture of the two Miss Sucklings, who
came crying to the place for fear their brother Sir John,
who was an inveterate gambler, should lose "all their
portions," and therewith, no doubt, poor damsels, their

       UNIVERSITY CLUB</head></figure>
 </p>
 <p>  But before reaching the Circus, by glancing down St.
James's Street we get one of the prettiest street vistas
in London; framed at the foot of the hill is the
Tudor gateway of St. James's Palace, one of the very
few remnants of that style of architecture that we have
left, and for that reason, rambling and inconvenient as
the palace is, highly cherished. By its means we may
picture the more readily the ancient Palace of Whitehall.
From the time of Henry VIII. who rebuilt the
old leper hospital, up to the reign of the Fourth George,
who preferred Buckingham Palace and doubtless admired
it more also, St. James's was one of the principal





 <pb id="p.109"  n="109"/>


London residences of our sovereigns; indeed after the
burning of Whitehall in the reign of William III. the
only one.</p>
   <p>St. James's Street and Pall Mall are the heart and
centre of Clubland; it is true <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> now vies with
them, but without the same traditions behind it. </p>
 <p> All clubs, as Addison somewhere remarked, "are
founded upon eating and drinking," but this does not
prevent their variety being considerable, from the highly
respectable to the fast, and the almost domestic to the
risky. Fortunately in the present day, though the
clubs have reached a height of luxury in appointments
which leaves little to be attained, they do not exactly
take the place in the lives of the adult male population
that they used to do. In the palmy days of the
eighteenth century, when men lost their whole fortune
at a sitting, when &#x00A3;2000 or &#x00A3;3000 was no uncommon
evening's loss, the lives of the womenkind connected
with these men must have been somewhat precarious.
"At Almack's," Walpole writes in <date value="1770">1770</date>, "the young
men of the age lose ten, fifteen, twenty thousand pounds
an evening." At the Cocoa Tree he speaks of a cast
at hazard of &#x00A3;180,000, and at Almack's, " Mr. Thynne
having won only 12,000 guineas in two months, retired
in disgust." But whatever the faults of those times
in Clubland, they are toned down by that beautiful
perspective, which, like the atmosphere of London itself,
enriches the details and hides the unsightliness; and
looking back to the pictures which most of us have
gained from reading the novels dealing with Clubland

     <pb id="p.110"  n="110"/>





in the eighteenth century, we seem to see a procession
of infinitely attractive young men, gay and gallant, if a
little wild, clad in blue satin with exquisite lace ruffles,
and yet not dandies, but ready to flash out with the
sword on all possible provocation; and to match them
girls brought up in the utmost delicacy, with bewitching
eyes and fair skins, the fairer for the provoking little
patches; who combined the daintiness of a princess with
the spirit of a modern girl; who got themselves into all
sorts of impossible situations but issued therefrom in
the last chapter with virtue unsmirched, to be married
to the man of their heart, who had - appearances
being notoriously deceitful-loved none other than his
one dear lady all the time. Who would lose such a
setting for such figures ?</p>
  <p> But among these figures there are others, darkly outlined,
  those of the sneak and the bully and the real
gamester, who made a fortune out of other men not
so cunning or so sharp witted, and these are not so
pleasant.  Clubland seems to enter less and less into
the life of the middle-class householder; he has no
time for his club; his work in these strenuous days,
and his home, absorb all his energies, and there are
many London men who belong to no club, though
well able to afford it, and yet never feel the want
of one.</p>
    <p>As for Pall Mall, who that has read it can ever
 forget the picture given by Evelyn of "pretty Nelly"
 leaning out of the window of her house to discuss the
 time of day with Charles II. out for an airing in the

<pb id="p.111"  n="111"/>



 Green Park below. Kings were unsophisticated in their
 manners two hundred and fifty years ago.</p>
  <p>  Right across the foot of <placeName key="Regent Street">Regent Street </placeName>, now called
 Waterloo Place, where at present steps give access to
 the Park, stood Carlton House, in the time of the
 Regency the scene of the maddest orgies, under the
presidency of the Prince of Wales, afterwards George
IV. Here his daughter Charlotte was born, and here
her marriage took place. Turning eastward with the
omnibus we pass through part of Pall Mall, seeing the
magnificent Carlton Hotel, where suppers take place at
which every table has its titled persons or celebrities;
and also His Majesty's Theatre, on the site of the Opera
House for which nearly all Handel's operas were composed,
and through which the names of Grisi, Rubini,
Mario, and Jenny Lind first became familiar to
Londoners.</p>
    <p>Then we come to <placeName key="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square </placeName>, of which a small
boy from a provincial town, on paying his first visit to
London, asked with great solemnity, "Is this the marketplace

  <p><placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> and its associations we have already
dealt with, but the modern Whitehall, now one of the
finest streets in the Metropolis, is well worth a longer
look than we can give in passing. On the west are the
stern Government Offices, and on the east is the new
War Office, while the towers and spires of the Houses
of Parliament rise over the buildings at the far end and
over the trees of Montagu House.</p>
  <p>Passing <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> we enter the Strand, and here

<pb id="p.112"  n="112"/>


it is difficult to speak of the bygone associations, so
thickly do they crowd upon us. From a winding
country road to a strand whereon the nobles built their
palaces, and again in the whirligig of time to a street of
shops, and it must be confessed mean buildings, the
Strand has touched the wheel of life at every point.
Even now, in spite of its mean buildings, it has views
to show, as we shall presently see. <placeName key="Charing Cross
Station">Charing Cross
Station</placeName> replaces Hungerford Market, which stood on
part of the ground occupied by the great house of the
proud favourite Buckingham. His water-gate is left,
and can be seen at the foot of Buckingham Street, where
it is literally stranded, high and dry, and far from the
water. Before Buckingham House stood here York
House, the property of the Archbishop of York. In
this house Bacon was born; before that again the house
belonged to the Duke of Suffolk, and originally was
the town residence of the bishops of Norwich. This
grand pedigree of owners may be taken as typical of
the Strand houses; to mention them all would become a
tedious catalogue, therefore only those salient facts that
make the dry bones live will be here entered. On the
site of the Adelphi was the town house of the lordly
prince-bishops of Durham, who exchanged it with
Henry VIII. for Cold Harbour and other City houses.
The King himself did not disdain to make merry in
Durham House, and held here great festivities on his
marriage with the poor plain Anne of Cleves. Within
its walls Lady Jane Grey was married. When it belonged
to Queen <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, she bestowed it on Sir

Walter Ralegh, who lived in it, and had a study looking
out upon the water. Near it was afterwards built
the New Exchange, a fashionable place for shops and
flirtations.</p>
  <p> The huge Cecil Hotel has a right to its name, for it
stands where once stood a mansion of Sir Robert Cecil,
second son of Lord Burghley. Next to it was Worcester
House, in which Anne Hyde was married to the Duke
of York, afterwards James II. Opposite was Exeter
House, built by Lord Burghley. Down Savoy Street we
have one of those peeps which are the charm of London;
here are a quiet churchyard, waving green trees, and a
small church, shut in and surrounded by high business
premises, forming an oasis. This is royal property,
belonging to the Duchy of <placeName key="Lancaster">Lancaster</placeName>; and the title to it
goes very far back, even to <persName key="John of Gaunt">John of Gaunt</persName>, from whom
the Lancastrian sovereigns descended, and who, through
Henry VII., is the ancestor of our present king. The
Savoy, as we see it represented in old prints, was a great
fortress-like building with its foundations reaching down
to the water.  It was in turn Palace, Prison, and
Hospital. <persName key="King John">King John</persName> of <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, whom <persName key="Edward">Edward</persName> the
Black Prince treated with so much civility, was a

extravagance so incensed the mob that in the great riots of Wat Tyler's
time   his palace was one of the first to be sacked. A
hospital for one hundred poor people was afterwards
founded here by Henry VII.; and later still the place
was partly a military prison.</p>

their full beauty the two churches, St. Mary-le-Strand
and St. Clement Danes, standing in a line, and backed
up by the Law Courts. The late Strand improvements,
by opening out the streets around, have set St. Mary's in
a much better position, and the effect of a mysterious
duplication is seen in the storied tower of St. Clement's
rising behind it.</p><p>

</p>
   <p>On the north is the huge building of the new Gaiety
Theatre in a classical style, and beyond it acres of
brick and dust lying in heaps on the desolate ground.
Somerset House, formerly Somerset Palace, owes its
name to the Protector Somerset, who used enough
stones from other buildings, religious and secular, to
have made his house a veritable cry of "Shame," if
stones had tongues. In pursuance of his selfish policy
he did not scruple to pull down buildings not actually
decayed, including the beautiful cloister on the north
side of St. Paul's, where was the famous painting called
the Dance of Death. The Protector himself had to
go the way of death while still a comparatively young
man, about forty-six, and his great new building, which
had involved so much disregard of property, was
unfinished.  Later it was the assigned dwelling of
Queen Henrietta Maria and her French attendants,
who seem to have been rather too much for the Court
at Whitehall.  Inigo Jones, the architect, died in
Somerset House.   The present building, put up in
<dateRange from="1776" to="1786">1776-86</dateRange>,
houses several great Government departments, and in
the courtyard volunteers assemble on half
holidays.</p>

<pb id="p.115"  n="115"/>



   <p> Beyond Somerset House and King's College, which is
 in a wing of it, though apparently it will not long
 remain there, is Strand Lane with one of the oldest
 relics London possesses, a Roman bath, computed to be
 about two thousand years old, and shaming into
 insignificance such mushroom growths as even the oldest
 Somerset House. When London was still encompassed
 by the City wall, some of the better-class Romans saw
 the advantage of houses on the river-side. There was
 then no egress by Ludgate, which had not been opened,
 nor was there a bridge over the Fleet river; but they
 had access to the Thames from Holborn along a slight
 ridge, which ran from north to south, and ended at
 the foot of what is now Essex Street and Milford Lane.
 Here they formed a community or small village.
 Many remnants of their occupation have been discovered,
 and this ancient bath probably marks the site of
 the house of some magnate, who in luxury and understanding
 of detail was more superfine than we are now.
 Arundel House gardens possibly once enclosed this
 relic, for Arundel House came next to Somerset House,
 and the fine gardens stretched between, reaching down
 to the water. Of Arundel House we have a charming
 illustration in an old print, of groups of old buildings
 standing around a courtyard.  The gable ends are
 decorated, the sloping roofs are tiled, and timber framework
 supports the houses. The stable and the chapel
 are both to be seen, and the view is dated <date value="1646">1646</date>.
Milford Lane is specially noted by Gay :- -</p>

<p>   We come next to the group of streets once covered
 by Essex House and its gardens. The unfortunate and
 foolish Earl of Essex shut himself up in this mansion,
 and defied the Queen. The salient point in the attack
 seems to have been the mounting of artillery on the
 tower of St. Clement's Church in order to drive him
 out. How the street-gazers would revel in such a sight
 at the present time ! We now employ more peaceful
 methods to bring people to order, methods exemplified
 in the near neighbourhood of the Law Courts and the
 Temple.</p>
    <p>The changes in this part of London have been
enormous, and were <persName key="Dr. Johnson">Dr. Johnson</persName> to sally forth in order
to occupy his old pew in St. Clement Danes he would
speedily lose himself. The great crescent of Aldwych
sweeps down to the church; gone is Booksellers' Row
or Holywell Street, with its secondhand-book shops
and quaint houses; gone is Lyons Inn, and many
another house. All that can be said is that the alteration
is an improvement, and therefore the price paid is not
too heavy.  The building of the Law Courts, in  868,
made the first inroads into the antiquity and the
unsavouriness of a neighbourhood that had seen better


   <pb id="p.117"  n="117"/>



days; and many a foul rookery and noisome tenement
was cleared away. Among the lanes thus demolished
was Shear or Shire Lane, where was a famous tavern
in which met the Kit-Kat Club, and from     which
Addison dated many of his essays.</p>
<p>Butcher Row, running on the north side of the
church, was at one time a very fashionable place of
residence; here lodged the French Ambassador De
Rosny, when he came to England.   Of the house he
occupied we have a print in its old days, with its overhanging
storey falling forward and its lines sadly out
of the perpendicular; it was a picturesque, dilapidated,
-tumble-down old mansion. In place of these fearful
joys there are now the much-discussed Law Courts,
with the trimly kept green grass, the fat pigeons, and
the row of cabs beside the church.</p>
 <p>  Temple Bar, one of those famous obstructions to
 traffic in which our ancestors delighted, was removed in
 <date value="1878">1878</date>, and the Griffin, familiarly known as the " Dragon,"
 put up in its place; the griffin himself is not a "bad
 beast," but his "too too solid" pedestal is hardly to be
 classed among things artistic, yet the whole monument
 performs the very useful function of marking the extreme
westerly limits of the City, and as a symbol cannot be
overlooked. Temple Bar, familiar to every one from
prints, and still standing in the park at Cheshunt, was
the work of the great Sir Christopher. Not that its
predecessor was burnt, for the Fire was stayed before it
reached so far, but because the old gate was considered
dilapidated and unsightly. This earlier gate was a very



 <pb id="p.118"  n="118"/>


 solid edifice, with three rounded gateways, the central
 one large and the two side ones smaller; it had four
 engaged pilasters running up the frontage, and a somewhat
 flattened penthouse roof, higher than many of the
 houses near it. These, with their gables and dormer
 windows, with their broad beams and diamond panes,
 must have made a good setting for the cumbrous old
 gateway. One of the uses of Temple Bar was to carry
 on spikes the heads of traitors, and it is said that in a
 high wind these heads occasionally, especially if they
 had been there for some time, broke away from their
 supports and fell down upon the passers-by! </p>
 <p> The narrow attractive entries of Middle and Inner
Temple invite an excursion, and the precincts within
are well in keeping. Brick is the distinctive material
of the Temple, and has been so from the first. It is
said that the brick buildings of the Temple stopped the
Fire, which had before reaching them grown lusty on a
diet of wooden houses. Brick, toned by the smut and
dust and age of generations, attains that indescribably
russet hue of a gentle old age that is still hale; and
this is seen to perfection in the Temple. The same
colour may be seen in the dwelling of the canons of
St. Paul's in Amen Court, but here the hue is of one age
and generation only, in the Temple there is every variety
of brick, brick new and still unchastened, brick worn and
wrinkled, brick richly glowing, brick brown with time,
and all enhanced by being seen through trees or across
wide spaces of smooth green. The quaint names of the
old courts are still the same as in the sixteenth century,


 <pb id="p.119"  n="119"/>
Figtree Court, Pump Court, Hare Court, and Paper
Buildings; and the quaintness is in keeping with the
spirit of the place. The Temple, as the name confesses,
was first held by the Knights Templars, and their church
still remains one of the few old relics of Norman
London. When the property came into the hands of
<orgName key="the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem">the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</orgName> they let it to the
Law Students, on whom it was conferred in perpetuity
by James I. The Outer Temple meantime had been
granted to Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, who was beheaded
in <date value="1326">1326</date>, and on this site was afterwards built
Essex House, already referred to; hence it comes that
there is no Outer Temple, a fact which has puzzled
many persons.</p>
    <p>On the days of the Temple Flower Show, when the
 wide green lawns are covered with women in the most
 beautiful colours and fabrics that art can produce, when
 great marquees are piled high with gorgeous blossoms,
 and the air is filled with gay voices, the Temple wakes
 up from its philosophic calm; in the dusty chambers
 barristers entertain their friends, and windows thrown
 wide show many an unexpected bit of colour in a floating
scarf or a brilliant sunshade; law books are hurried
away, the accumulated dust of months is displaced, and
surge from  the outer world sweeps up over the
Temple.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the City, our limit in this direction
is reached, for the City is described elsewhere. Leaving
Fleet Street with its busy newspaper life, which reaches
its full tide of activity at midnight, we turn northward


<pb id="p.120"  n="120"/>


  up Chancery Lane, narrower than is common even in
  a London street, but until the completion of Kingsway
  still the only direct connection between the two
  great highways running east and west. At the low
  end of the Lane near Fleet Street once lived Izaak
  Walton. To the east rises the fair fabric of the new
  Record Office, a building worthy of this age, though
  too much hemmed in to be seen to advantage. The
  best view is from Clifford's Inn Gardens. The fine
  Tudor gateway of Lincoln's Inn is one of the few
  remaining specimens of this style, with the gateway of
  St. James's, already mentioned, and that of Clerkenwell
  and Lambeth Palace.</p>
   <p> <figure id="fig.046" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00046"><head>HOLBORN HILL
</head></figure>Lincoln's Inn, with its air of seclusion, its worn red
 brick and new stone, with its smooth green lawns and
 leafy trees, is one of those oases so much appreciated by
 the lover of London, where the charm of the great City
 seems concentrated.  Here in the fourteenth century
 stood the house and garden of the Earl of Lincoln;
 the garden was of twenty acres, and yielded bushels
 of roses, besides other flowers and many vegetables.
 Lincoln's Inn Fields was once part of Ficketts Fields, a
 place of jousting. Amid the wide cobble-stone spaces
 where cabs stand aimlessly about, where errand boys
 pause to play with the well-to-do pigeons, where a
 few of the waifs and strays of humanity forget for a
 while their woes on the seats in the centre garden, there
 is the same air of aloofness, of detachment, as in the
 Temple; it is a real eddy or backwater in the great
rushing stream of strenuous life. Yet even this quiet






<pb id="p.121"  n="121"/>

spot is stained with blood. The execution of William,
Lord Russell was carried out here in <date value="1683">1683</date>, for it
was feared that the mob, who held him a high-souled
patriot, might rise to the rescue were it to take place on
the better-known Tower Hill. After the Babington
conspiracy no less than fourteen men were "hanged,
bowelled, and quartered " here. Seven of them, including
Babington, were drawn on hurdles from Tower Hill
" unto a fielde at the upper end of Holborne, hard by
the high-way side to St. Giles's, where was erected a
scaffold convenient for the execution."  It is said that
Babington himself was still alive when the last tortures
were being inflicted, and that he exclaimed aloud in his
agony, "Jesu, Mercy ! " so that <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, hearing of it,
directed that the rest, who were to be hanged the
following day, should be hanged until they were dead.
The effect of these doings on the natures of those who
performed them, it is not difficult to conceive. The
Viaduct has now done away with the "heavy hill" up
from the valley of the Fleet, and Holborn runs a level
course. New <placeName key="Oxford Street">Oxford Street </placeName> was made in <date value="1840">1840</date>, and
before that time the highway curved through Broad
Street and High Street. To the north of New Oxford
Street, beyond the spot where now stand the stern walls
of the British Museum, were fields, which, like all these
large open spaces once surrounding London, spaces
now completely enclosed or built over, were a resort for
the citizens and a theatre for fights and rowdyism.
Even duels of a sort took place here, and one gave rise
to the legend of the Forty Footsteps, for it was said


<pb id="p.122"  n="122"/>


 that two brothers had slain each other while the lady
 they both desired to win looked on, and that thereafter
 no grass grew on the places where their feet had
 trodden.</p>
    <p>There is nothing beautiful about this part of
London: the houses in some of the great squares are
well and comfortably built; from an inside point of
view they are desirable enough, but externally the huge
squares and wide streets, equally with the poor and
narrow ones, are dreary in the extreme. It may perhaps
be taken as typical of the English character that, to use
a common but expressive phrase, we do not "put all
our goods in the shop window." Go where you will in
London, in the west-central district about Bloomsbury,
in the south-western district around Cromwell Road, in
the western district about Paddington, in all those
districts which may, according to a recent satirical writer,
be termed " stuccovia," and you find the same thing,
long dreary lines of houses plastered with stucco in
smooth drab, or stucco that apes stone without
enough verisimilitude to deceive a child, and the effect
is not beautiful. To a country man it would seem impossible
to occupy one of these houses, so monotonously
alike, so square and solid and unrelenting they seem,
but go into one of them that is already occupied, and in
a moment the exterior aspect is forgotten. As likely as
not a fair garden stretches away at the back, the sun
shines into the living-rooms, which are large, airy, of a
good shape, and prettily furnished; and a Londoner
soon learns that a dull wall of blank stucco may conceal
          <pb id="p.123"  n="123"/>

many treasures, and that very few of the houses lack
gardens or are shut off from sunlight.</p>
<p>But this is a digression. Near St. Giles's Church, as
we have seen, the condemned criminal on his journey
Tyburnwards consumed his last bowl of ale; but St.
Giles's had another enviable distinction that brought
custom to its ale-houses and filled its landlords' pockets.
That was the fact that in the beginning of the fifteenth
century it had a gallows of its own, and a place of
execution at the end of the High Street. At this spot,
now covered by perpetually recurring waves of traffic,
<persName key="Oldcastle, Sir John  ">Sir John Oldcastle </persName>was hung in chains, and slowly
roasted to death.</p>
     <p> We have a map showing us this district as it was in
<date value="1570">1570</date>. Open fields lie between Drury Lane and St.
Martin's Lane, which were then real lanes with hedges.
The fields are crossed by footpaths, one of which is now
Long Acre, and, according to the map, tenanted by
monstrous cows, which in proportion to the size of the
houses are veritably big enough to have been dieted on
the "food of the gods." Along the north side of Broad
Street there is a row of small houses, and the precinct
of St. Giles's, enclosed by a wall, is lozenge-shaped, and
has several trees within it, besides the buildings of the
ancient hospital and the church, not the same church
as at present. It must have been a pleasant country
walk to go to St. Giles's-in-the-Fields from London.
Another Brobdingnagian bull disports himself behind
the hedge that lines the north side of the High Street,
   his pasture runs right up to the "Way to Tottenhall,"

<pb id="p.124"  n="124"/>


 while beyond him there is nothing but fields so
far as eye can see. Southampton House stands by itself
to the east in an enclosure with a gate. Altogether it
is a pastoral scene. Hog Lane, as <placeName key="Charing Cross Road">Charing Cross Road</placeName>
was formerly called, ran-up to within forty years of
Stow's time-between "fair hedgerows of elms with
pleasant bridges and easy stiles to pass over into the
pleasant fields, very commodious for citizens therein
to walk, shoot, or otherwise recreate and refresh their
dull spirits in the sweet and wholesome air."</p>
  <p> Passing on westward we get a glimpse of Soho, one of
the prettiest squares in London, with exceptionally fine
trees. The Duke of Monmouth brought this district
into fashion by building a mansion for himself on the
south side of the square; and here in the eighteenth
century Mrs. Cornelys's parties "by subscription"
attained enormous dimensions, attracting crowds to the
neighbourhood. Now this is largely the French and
Italian quarter; if you pass down the street and hear
two men talking eagerly with many gesticulations, it is
three to one they are Frenchmen, or if you go into a
small shop for fruit or a newspaper, the man who serves

 <p>So little is left of the old London, the London of
 history and association, that we are in danger of forgetting
 amid what historic scenes we move as we go
 daily to our business or our pleasure. But in the street
 names, if properly considered, we can always find a
 reminder; no 133rd Street or 98th Avenue has yet
 been adopted by our Borough Councils to obscure past
 memories, and it is safe to say that that day will never
 come for London, any more than with all the improvements
 and reconstructions will she ever be a town of
 right angles and straight lines.</p><p>
   The subject of these street names is a large one, and
it is difficult to do full justice to it in view of the
countless examples that crowd upon the mind. To
attempt to deal with them in any sort of topographical
order is useless; therefore they shall be chosen haphazard,
as a child draws counters from a bag.</p><p>
  Knightrider Street :-What visions this name evokes
of tall and well-mounted men, with plumes waving from
their helmets, riding two by two down a narrow street







<pb id="p.130"  n="130"/>

between houses of timber and plaster, gable and pinnacle,
and storeys so much overhanging that they almost shut
out the light of the sky.   Knightrider Street lies
between St. Paul's Churchyard and Queen Victoria
Street, and is roughly parallel with both, running into
the latter where it turns up to the Mansion House.
Stow says it was so called from the fact that the knights
"well armed and mounted," starting from     Tower
Royal, went this way to Smithfield, where the great
tournaments and tilts were held. But the real reason
why this street was selected for the title rather than
others is that Lord Fitzwalter, who lived at Castle
Baynard, used to assemble the City train-bands at his
mansion before proceeding to Smithfield, and it was the
number of knights passing this way to the rendezvous
that originated the name. The street now called Giltspur
Street was formerly known as Knightrider, and
with more justification, leading as it does to Smithfield,
where the chief tournaments took place.<figure id="fig.047" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00047"><head>AUTUMN AFTERNOON-FROM SOUTHWARK BRIDGE</head></figure></p>
<p>   The Strand speaks for itself. A Strand indeed it was.
Stretching by the side of the river long before an Embankment
was ever thought of; a fair strand and yet withal
miry, and crossed by several hundred rivulets, some so
wide that bridges were built over them, as Ivy Bridge
and Strand Bridge. The Strand gave its name to the
village that sprang up thereon, according to Maitland,
and itself was the main road between the Cities of London
and <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
a road full of deep holes and interrupted by "thickets and bushes." Paternoster Row
and Ave Maria Lane speak of days prior to the






<pb id="p.131"  n="131"/>



  Reformation, when Aves and Paternosters were bartered
daily. A Paternoster meant originally a rosary, but in
   time the term  came to include also one who made
rosaries, and the salesmen in Paternoster Row supplied
   rosaries, and all other objects of devotion, such as
crucifixes, candles, service books, etc., to the faithful
   who worshipped at St. Paul's.  Ave Maria Lane was
   so called, says Stow, "because of stationers and text
writers who wrote and sold there all sorts of books then
  in use, namely A. B. C. with the Paternoster, Ave, the
  Creed, the Graces, etc."</p>
    <p> St. Marylebone has been taken by some to mean St.
  Mary-le-bonne; but this is not the right derivation: the
  name was taken from the situation of the church, which
  stood on the banks of the Tyburn stream, and was
  consequently St. Mary at the Bourne or burn.
     Earl's Court has a pleasant aristocratic flavour.</p>
<p>One involuntarily imagines an earl holding a small
  court in state, where much ceremonial was used, and
  men and women of noble birth forgathered and displayed
  their gorgeous clothes and fought secretly but
bitterly for precedence. This surmise is but an empty
vision; an earl there was truly enough, the Earl of
Oxford, who was lord of the manor, and here certainly
he held his court, but it was a court of justice not of
  ceremonial. The court-house stood on the site of
  Barkston Gardens, near the present Underground Railway,
  and was still there so late as  878, though nearly
one hundred years previously the courts had been transferred
elsewhere.</p>
                 <pb id="p.132"  n="132"/>
  <p> The name of Bayswater has doubtless caused some
people to reflect gravely, and there is certainly nothing
in the present district that could give a clue to the
name. In older maps it is marked "Bayswatering."
Now, as Maitland tells us, there was in the year <date value="1439">1439</date> a
very important " head of water " in Paddington, " containing
twenty-six perches in length and one in
breadth," and this was granted by the Abbot of Westminster
to the mayor and citizens of London, and it
was called Baynard's watering-place, though who or
what Baynard was no one seems able to ascertain.
There was certainly a Juliana Baysbolle, who had held
land in Paddington, and she may have been connected
with the "head of water," but this is pure conjecture.</p>
   <p><placeName key="Regent Street">Regent Street </placeName> bears its date in its name, as a street
may well do. <persName key="Nash, John ">John Nash</persName>, the chief architect in the
days of the Regency, propounded an idea royal in
magnificence, nothing less than to build a street of
exceptional width from the Prince Regent's town house,
Carlton House, to a country mansion to be built for
His Royal Highness in Regent's Park. Nash brought
stucco into fashion, and his completed street is the great
example of stucco in London. It is well known that
there was at first a colonnade of columns in front of the
shops, but this was found to darken the windows so
much that it was subsequently removed. <placeName key="Regent Street">Regent Street </placeName>
was finished about the time that George IV. ascended
the throne. Nash had at first designed to make a
straight line up Portland Place, but he finally abandoned



 <pb id="p.133"  n="133"/>


this idea and formed the turn as we now see it. The
country house in Regent's Park was never built. </p>
<p> The name of Holborn is easily solved. There was,
  until the making of the viaduct, a deep depression in
Holborn down to which the thoroughfare sloped steeply,
and in this depression ran the river or bourne known in
its lower part as the Fleet. It was most likely referred
to colloquially as the burn or bourne in the hole, hence
Holebourne.</p>
   <p>Cheapside has a derivation certain and clear; it was
 the way that ran by the side of the chepe or market,
 from time immemorial the most important market
 in the City.   At first this was lined by stalls or
 open sheds, and these afterwards grew into closed
 shops.  The streets leading out of Cheapside proclaim
 what was sold in various parts of the market:
 we have Bread Street, Milk Street, Honey Lane, Ironmonger
 Lane, and Poultry.  Probably very few of the
 people who constantly pass through it guess that the
 last name is a true reminder that once there was here
the greatest poultry market in London. Stow says,
"then employed by poulterers that dwelt in the High
Street from the Stocks market to the great Conduit.
Their poultry which they sold at their stalls were
scalded there.  The street doth yet bear the name of
the Poultry, and the poulterers are but lately departed
from thence into other streets."  There was another
poultry market at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</p>
<p>Eastcheap has of course the same origin, having
been the eastern market.  Gracechurch Street is akin

<pb id="p.134"  n="134"/>


to the Haymarket in its meaning, though certainly the
derivation does not lie on the surface. Both streets
were markets for grass or dried grass, thus Graschirche
(as it was originally spelt) and Haymarket, though at
Gracechurch there seems to have been traffic in various
kinds of herbs as well as hay. This name was frequently
corrupted into Gracious, and is so spelt by some old
writers, which is misleading.  In Gracechurch Street
was also the great corn market, to which corn came from
all parts, the memory of which may be traced in the
adjacent Cornhill.  Cannon Street has gone far from
its original spelling, for it was at first written chiefly
Candlewike, but with many varieties, such as Candlewright
and Canewyke. There seems, however, to be
little doubt that the name was connected with the
manufacture of candles; it was the candlemakers'
quarter, and their hall is on Dowgate Hill close by.
In Newcourt's map of <date value="1658">1658</date> the street first appears
under its present spelling.</p>
  <p><figure id="fig.048" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00048"><head>PICCADILLY, NEAR DOWN STREET</head></figure> Jewry was of course the Jews' quarter. At the first
coming of the Jews to London they received this convenient
and central site for their residence, and their
synagogue stood at the north-eastern corner. The
precinct was walled round, and fines were inflicted on
Christians found there after nightfall. In <date value="1290">1290</date>, when
the Jews were banished, their synagogue was given to
the Fratres de Sacca, an order of friars.</p>
  <p> Lombard Street was in like manner the quarter of
the Lombards or Italian merchants, who came over at
first as collectors of the papal revenue, and afterwards







 <pb id="p.135"  n="135"/>

stayed to carry on trade. So successful was this foreign
enterprise that Lombard Street became the regular place
of mart or exchange with the London merchants before
the building of the Royal Exchange. The name of
Fenchurch Street has been commonly derived from its
being situated in a fenny or marshy place, but as there
seems to have been very little marsh about here an
attempt has been made to derive it from the French
foin, hay; in the same way that Gracechurch was the
grass market so Fenchurch would be the hay market;
Professor Skeat admits this as just possible, if it comes
through the Anglo-French word fein, but thinks it
unlikely.</p>
<p>Of Leadenhall there seems to be no ascertainable
derivation, and the curious word Threadneedle is lost
in antiquity, though it has been suggested it may have
originated with some house bearing the sign of the
Three Needles.</p>
   <p>The word <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName>, belonging to such a well-known
part of the town, and being so peculiar, has attracted
much attention.  It has generally been stated to be
connected with the enormous Pickadillas or ruffs worn
by the fashionable in the time of the Tudors; these
ruffs made the fortune of one Higgins a tailor to whom
the land belonged. Others have taken it from the same
word meaning a wide hem or edge of a skirt or other
garment, and suggested that the last house in the
suburbs, as a famous house in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> at one time
was, might have been denominated the edge or skirt
house. Pennant traces the name to piccadillas, meaning



<pb id="p.136"  n="136"/>



turnovers or cakes, which may have been sold here.
But the derivation suggested by Mr. W. J. Loftie is
the most likely. " Robert Baker," he says, " who died in
<date value="1623">1623</date>, is described as of <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> Hall. This was a
kind of tea-garden, a place of amusement. There can be
no reasonable doubt that Baker meant to describe his
house and garden as a place it would be a peccadillo
to visit."</p>
   <p>Mayfair needs no such dubious endeavour, for, as
already stated, a May fair there was beyond all cavilling.
   <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> was anciently written Chelchith, of which
the termination hith meant a haven. Gravelly banks
or pebble stones frequently occur in the form of
"Chesel," as in Winchelsea, and so some sort of
gravelly bank with a bay or landing-place may
originally have been the distinctive mark of <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>
in the eyes of the primitive men who used the great
waterway.</p><p>

   <p>The limits of the ancient City within the walls may
easily be traced by the names of its gates or posterns.
Beginning on the west, we have Ludgate, Newgate,
Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate and
Aldgate, but the Liberties, now all included in the City,
reach far beyond this, and our present City begins at
Temple Bar.</p>

<p>THE omnibus drivers and conductors are so typical of
the spirit of everyday London condensed, and, as a class,
so peculiar to London, that a book of this kind on
  London would be incomplete without some reference
to them.</p>
<p>We have probably all talked to bus drivers, for they
are so convenient to approach, though, be it noted,
omnibus etiquette forbids that they should begin a
conversation. We have, perhaps, gleaned various facts
as to their work and manner of livelihood, and we have
come away with the impression that a 'bus driver is
"an uncommonly good fellow."  So he is, and without
going so far as to say that none but good fellows need
apply for these posts, it is pretty certain that the bad
ones get weeded out. There are far more black sheep,
far more habitual drunkards among cabmen than ever
there are in the ranks of 'bus drivers. The whole
environment of the two sets of men is different, and
tends to develop the character differently. A cabman
is his own master, even though he does not own a cab.


 <pb id="p.140"  n="140"/>



He is free to dawdle and loiter and go where he will,
and a very large part of his day is perforce spent in
loitering, in reading halfpenny papers, in gossiping
with his brother-cabmen, and smoking; so that a man
used to this life becomes gradually unfitted for any other
requiring steady concentration. So long as he be not
recklessly drunk, the cabman can drive as well as when
he is sober, sometimes even better, and it would
probably astonish the Londoner if he knew how many
night cabmen were drunk habitually, and how many
day cabmen went home every night with more than was
good for them.</p>
   <p><figure id="fig.050" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00050"><head>VICTORIA TOWER AND EAST END OF
      WESTMINSTER ABBEY</head></figure>Omnibus drivers are under much closer supervision,
a man constantly drunk would almost certainly be
reported, and besides one with a tendency that way
would assuredly by the end of the day be in a condition
to call down notice on himself. The average omnibus
goes five journeys a day. After driving, it may be,
eight miles, it would seem natural enough for a driver
to have a drink, yet if he yields to this and takes a
drink at each end of each journey he consumes ten
drinks a day, exclusive of what he has at meal-times!
In these circumstances men with any sense see that they
must not give way to a drink at each end of the journey,
and soon learn to do without it.</p>
   <p>In the matter of money, a driver gets regular wages,
 6s. a day for the first year and thereafter 6s. 6d.;
 or, if on a "non-relief line," is. more. He regulates
 his expenditure accordingly. With the cabman it is
 "lightly come and lightly go."  He may make a







<pb id="p.141"  n="141"/>

pocketful of money one day, whereupon he has a
"roaring spree," and stays off work the next. But the
"uncertainty of his gains prevents his attempting to put
by for a rainy day; he takes the rainy and the shining
days as they come.   Consequently cabmen as a class
-are utterly unthrifty; generous enough and free in
their treatment of comrades, but improvident. If the
truth be confessed, each set of men looks down on the
other, the drivers holding the cabmen to be a shiftless,
thriftless lot, and the cabbies looking on the drivers as
slow old stagers who are in service, while they themselves
are free men. It is curious that while numbers of
drivers become cabmen, hardly ever a cabman passes to
the more regular life of the omnibus. But one virtue
both classes have in common, they are full of esprit
de corps, and a "whip round" for the widow of a
comrade never fails to produce a good result. </p>
 <p> Let us take a day in the life of an ordinary omnibus
driver.  He will belong to a yard, that is to say, the
Company have accepted his license, and he is an " odd "
man until he gets a service of his own. In the early
morning, six o'clock at all events, even if he live near the
yard, he must be up, and off. There are no omnibuses
then to take him to his destination, so in the grey of
the wintry morning, it may be, he walks through the
silent streets to the great yard, where a few horse-keepers
are harnessing the first pair to go out. It is a curious
sight this yard; the dim vastness of the roof holds grey
fog in its arch; the omnibuses, blue and red and gold,
have a forlorn appearance, standing side by side packed


<pb id="p.142"  n="142"/>



like dominoes in a box. As each omnibus comes in at
night it takes up its appointed place; it is easy enough
for the first man, who has plenty of room to manceuvre
in, but the last one has a very tight fit indeed, and has
to display great skill in driving. From one end of the
yard an inclined plane like a greatly magnified hen-walk,
is the staircase for the horses, and leads to the upper
storey of the stables.</p><p>
<figure id="fig.051" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00051"><head>FROM THE CORNER OF RICHMOND
          TERRACE</head></figure></p>
<p>
   From the stables comes a sound of munching and
moving. There are numbers of horses there, probably
three hundred altogether, separated by swinging bales
only, so low that the row of sturdy, glossy backs can
be seen in a line. Eleven horses belong to each
omnibus, two for each journey and one out,-the odd
horse,-so that each gets one day's rest in turn. The
driver takes his pairs in any order he chooses; if he
thinks one horse a little tired from the day before
he can tell the horse-keeper to put him on for the
last journey, so that he gets a longer rest. He takes an
interest in his horses too, knows them by name, and
can discourse eloquently on all their peculiarities. The
average life of a 'bus horse, it is said, is about five
years, but some live much longer. They are well fed,
they have regular work, one journey out and back
once a day, and a veterinary surgeon is ready to inspect
them and to prescribe for all their ailments. Numbers
of the young horses come over from Ireland and are a
little shy of the London streets at first, but the weight
of the omnibus and the companionship of a steady old
horse soon sober them down.</p>






<pb id="p.143"  n="143"/>

<p>The driver who takes the first omnibus is at the yard
in  good time, buttoning up his stout gloves, and feeling
in his pockets for the tip that the horse-keeper reminds
him of, for though 'bus drivers are looked upon as
people to be tipped, they have lesser " tippees" attendant
on them. Our friend the new driver has provided
himself with a whip, and gloves, and a tarpaulin cape,
all of which are his private property, and not supplied
by the Company; he will find later, when he gets " a
service," that there are other expenses too, curb chains
for instance, if he wants to use them, and the wooden
boards to protect his legs from the cold as he sits on
the box seat. But he has not arrived at this yet.
Early as he is, there are three men there before him,
who will take precedence of him, so he sits down on a
wooden block and thinks regretfully of that last cup of
scalding tea he had to leave behind. As each omnibus
is ready the men, driver and conductor, appear just in
time, having learnt the exact knack by long training;
the conductors sign on for their tickets, and off they
go at intervals of four minutes.</p>
<p>The system of "relief" is so well worked that
even at the risk of boring some people a word must be
given to it here. The Road Car Company has relief
on all its lines, and the "General" on some. By this
system the men have fifteen hours';work one day and
nine the next, making the average of twelve demanded
at the great 'bus strike. For every four drivers there
is one relief driver. The omnibuses are, say, A, B, C,
and D. Each bus goes five journeys a day, counting



<pb id="p.144"  n="144"/>



there and back as one. On the morning of Monday
the odd driver takes the first two journeys of A. He
has the middle journey to himself, and takes the last
two journeys of B. The next day he takes C's first two
journeys in the morning, and D's last two at night.
Consequently driver A begins at the third journey on
Monday, and as each journey is reckoned at about three
hours, he gets a day of nine hours. The next day he is
at work all the time-five journeys of three hours each.
On Wednesday morning off again, and so on Friday.
The following week the odd driver begins with B in the
morning and takes A in the afternoon, so that this
week driver A begins as usual but goes off after the
third journey, getting his afternoon free, and he has a
full day alternately as before. The odd driver has
therefore a regular twelve-hour day, but always the
middle of the day off, and the others get mornings off
on alternate days one week, and afternoons off alternate
days another week. The process is just the same with
the conductors. Many men prefer the odd work and
keep to it all the time, but these regular odd men-to
use a contradiction in terms-must not be confounded
with the other odd men whom we are considering, and
who wait about in the yard on the chance of a day's
work.<figure id="fig.052" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00052"><head>THE WINTER OF <date value="1895">1895</date></head></figure>

</p>
   <p>If there are sixty 'buses on what is called a three
minutes' line, there will be a difference of three hours
between the first and last. The first man starts at seven
in the morning and, on a full day, finishes at ten at
night; while the last begins at ten in the morning and




<pb id="p.145"  n="145"/>



ends at one o'clock midnight; and to these hours must
be added the time taken in going to and from work:
then, if any buses are running, the drivers may go free on
them. On non-relief lines the men were asked to reply
by a plebiscite whether they would have an extra shilling
a day or take the full work, and when the majority
declared for the extra shilling the thing was established.
These men take as an average two days a fortnight off
on  their own account, of course forfeiting their day's
pay, but it is a recognised thing that they should make
this break, as no man could go on day in and day out
driving fifteen hours!</p>
<p>The conductors on these lines of course keep the
same hours as the drivers; they begin on a relief line at
4s. 6d. and rise to 5s., and they get an extra 1s. on
non-relief lines.</p>
<p>The odd men who are waiting to get a service receive
precisely the same pay as the others, but of course are
not sure of a full week's work; as a rule they can
count on an average of five days in the week.
It may be that the first odd man waiting for a job
gets put on to an omnibus of which the driver is ill
and will not return to work for three weeks, in which
case the odd driver remains on that omnibus for the
three weeks. There is great luck in this. Our odd
man may chance to wait three hours, and then he may
get put on an omnibus where he has to do a full day of
fifteen hours. He has already waited three, and therefore
his day's work has lasted eighteen hours! But he
accepts it all philosophically; another's turn to-day,

<pb id="p.146"  n="146"/>


his to-morrow; with which consolatory reflection he
gives a small boy a penny to take a note to his "missus,"
telling her to be at the corner by the "Salisbury " at
two o'clock and to bring along the remains of that beefsteak
pudding for his dinner, swings himself on to his
box seat, and is off.</p>
   <p>It is hard work this driving, it makes men with
muscles like steel and bones like iron. To be at it for
fifteen hours, with alternate intervals of ten minutes
and twenty minutes each three hours, this is no light
task. It is not like driving a carriage horse with a
mouth of silk; pull as you may you can make no
impression on the mouth of a 'bus horse. Any one
handling the reins for the first time would find to his
surprise that the whole driving is pulling; sometimes
when there is a young horse with his head set homeward
you may see the man hanging on to the reins with
all his force. So hard is the work that if a man goes
off for a week or a fortnight's holiday he gets stiff at
once, and on resuming suffers until his muscles are in
training again. The odd men pretty soon get a service
of their own, whether as "regular" odd driver, which
some of them prefer, as they can always get home to
dinner, or with a service of their own and alternate half
days. Our friend of this morning left his house at halfpast
six, and will not return until two o'clock A.M.,
but this is exceptional.

Craft coming up on a flowing tide.</head></figure></p>
   <p>Wet and shine, storm and fine, the drivers face the
world cheerily; their tolerance of minor annoyances is
unbounded; it is almost impossible to provoke an







<pb id="p.147"  n="147"/>

omnibus driver. The policeman may domineer; the
slow traffic may prefer to go along in the centre of the
road a couple of yards from the kerb; the roadway may
be up for an unwarrantable time, necessitating a d&#x00E9;tour
which cuts off nearly the whole of that precious twenty
minutes' rest at Liverpool Street; the conductor may be
a fool, never looking round before he starts, and so constantly
starting and stopping again; yet all these things
the omnibus driver bears lightly. The only thing that
does vex his soul and make him commiserate his lot in
  heartfelt accents to any one who will listen, is when the
  foreman of the yard has a spite against him, and will
  make up his stud of the worst horses in the stable; for
the driver loves his horses, and is as proud of them as if
they belonged to him.</p>
  <p>In many other things besides his tolerance is he the
epitome of London street character-for instance, in
his general knowledge of what is going on, and his lack
of profundity. He knows all about the topics of
_the day, can discuss the King's speech, the fiscal policy,
or the latest cause celebre, with any one, but his
knowledge of these things is gathered from  casual
conversation, from the contents bills seen in his daily
journey, or at the most from   a halfpenny evening
paper. And the amazing power even of contents bills
to quicken a man's intelligence is seen in the contrast
between him and his brother of the country, who strides
behind his cart between leafy hedges, and never sees a
placard, unless it be that of an enterprising tradesman
who announces on a gatepost that his "Boots are the


 <pb id="p.148"  n="148"/>


Best in Britain." The 'bus driver's quick wit and his
knowledge of affairs are only equalled by his utter want
of what may be called "reading capability"; he never
opens a book; when he gets in, to sleep and eat are all
he cares about; if he has a bit of time off, jobs for the
wife, or play with the children, or an outing, fill up his
short recreation time ; the 'bus driver who reads is rare
indeed. Equally, he never enters a church; he never
has the opportunity. The only service attended by 'bus
drivers in any numbers is the midnight service on New
Year's Eve, which is considered to be a condonation for
the sins of the past year. Smart in person, kindly at
heart, tolerant, and shrewd, and capable, he is a citizen
well worth having. His sense of responsibility is
always being indirectly called upon, and no man readier
than he or more cool-headed when an accident happens.
Does a horse go down? He never stirs, but gives
comprehensive directions to his conductor without
moving. Does some unmanageable van or other knock
against his vehicle and take the paint off, he hardly
shows he notices it, yet nothing escapes him. Though
apparently looking straight ahead he sees the almost
imperceptible nod with which the woman on the off
pavement signifies that she wishes him to stop; he can
distinguish to a hair's-breadth between the nervous lady
who is waiting for his 'bus to pass before crossing, and
she who is gathering up her skirts to board him when
he shall stop for her. His driving is a marvel; with
the most unwieldy vehicle in the world he judges its
limits to a nicety. At the time of the great Jubilee,





<pb id="p.149"  n="149"/>



when 'buses, jammed for hours, had struggled slowly on
a couple of yards at a time, after having made the
circuit of London from the south side of the river, and
through the City westward, I said to the driver, " You
only touched once."  "Twice," he answered, though
with a grin of pride; "I felt one of them things just
lay against the back end of my 'bus for a second a while
ago."</p>
<p>The life is popular; it is regular, lived in the open air,
and full of incident.  " There's always something going
on," said one 'bus driver, "whether it's a horse down,
or a street fight, or a regiment of soldiers passing by;
you can't very well be dull; and then to hear the talk
behind you, well it would make you laugh sometimes;
them foreigners think the National Gallery is St. Paul's,
and the Nelson Column the Monument; they don't
know anything, not so to speak."</p>
  <p>These things happen to be on the line of his route, so
he is intimate with them; of the rest of London he is
profoundly ignorant, but like another great man he
might be represented as saying-</p>
  <p> What I know not is not knowledge.</p>

ON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE
        Night scene</head></figure></p>

 <pb id="p.153"  n="153"/>


<p>A LONDONER'S love for London may be tested by his
 regard for the river.  If he remark that he has seen
 rivers wider, and that he cannot discover any beauty " in
 all that rubbish," indicating the wharves and chimneys of
 the Surrey side, give him up; he is hopeless, and time
 will only be wasted on him. You might take him to
 <placeName key="Westminster Bridge">Westminster Bridge</placeName> at night, when the river is full to
 the brim, flooding up to the Embankment in great
 swirling pools, and the three-quarter moon hangs low
 in the sky, making a clear pathway of silver down the
 water; beyond which in the uncertain light the houses
 on the farther shore are transformed into shadowy
 castles. You might point out the spires and pinnacles
-of the Houses of Parliament rising against an indigo
sky, and the solemn yellow light of Big Ben hanging
midway in air; you might show him the ripples of
gold starting from the reflections of the lamps on the
bridge, and lapping against the sides of the ebony
barges, and he will turn away and light a cigarette and
say, "It's a jolly night certainly."</p>


<pb id="p.154"  n="154"/>


 <p> For those who love the river there is ever something
new, something wonderful, and for the first time disclosed, whenever they see her. They never noticed
before just that point of view, or just that effect; the
whole course of the river may be likened to a gorgeous
picture-book, of which each leaf in turning displays
itself in familiar outlines but with new colouring,
a fairy book indeed.</p>
  <p> <figure id="fig.055" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00055"><head>CHELSEA</head></figure>The river belonging to London may be said to begin
at Hammersmith Bridge, and Hammersmith Bridge,
with its airy outlines and general openness, seems fitting
amid its surroundings. On the south side, higher up
the stream, stretch long, low green banks, and the sheets
of water of a water company's reservoirs glitter in the
sun. The characteristic moment of Hammersmith
Bridge is on a fine Sunday morning, when the ground
is still touched by the lingering rime of a night frost,
when the sun is getting higher every moment and
diffusing around a yellow watery splendour, when
cyclists race past to Richmond, and the ripples lap
gently against the boats drawn up in Sunday peace on
the strip of muddy foreshore.</p>
   <p>The Mall on the north side was once a very fashionable
   place, where Catherine of Braganza came when a
widow; and where a celebrated court physician lived
in the days of Queen Anne. It is still desirable, and
has some fine old houses and two elms of respectable
antiquity. The river takes a great turn below
Hammersmith, sweeping round on one side past Barn
Elms, a favourite place for picnics in the days of the




 <pb id="p.155"  n="155"/>

Stuarts, and on the other passing near Brandenburgh
House, where lived the unhappy Queen Caroline,
wife of George IV., whose treatment by her husband
  made England contemptible in the eyes of the nations.
Market gardens still stud the Fulham bank, though in
  greatly diminished area. Soon the red roof of the old
part of the Bishop of London's palace rises above the
  trees, and we can see the windows of the rooms occupied
    by Laud.</p>
    <p>Putney Bridge is, like <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>, of white stone,
  with wide arches,-a fine bridge. At either end the
  square towers of the neighbouring churches stare at
  each other with a half-defiant, half-subdued expression,
  and on Sunday mornings, when the congregations are
  dispersing, there is a double stream of people coming
  and going, and not one passes without a look up or
  down the stretch of shining water. It may be merely
  a personal idiosyncrasy, but to the writer the atmosphere
  always seems to be clear at Putney, clear though soft.
  The lines of the wall embanking Bishop's Park stand
  out distinctly ; every rope and stick on the barges lying
  by the Putney side is clearly noticeable; even far up
  the river a boat with its rhythmic sweep of oars can be
  distinguished. There is a wide stretch of clear grey
  water, sometimes even blue in the summer sun; the air
  is fresh, clean, and invigorating, with no smoke hanging
  in it, and the wind blows free at Putney Bridge.</p>
   <p>  The green banks of Hurlingham come next and the
  gas-works and wharves of Wandsworth on the other
  side; it is a dull bit of water until we reach the dullest of


 <pb id="p.156"  n="156"/>


the bridges, namely Wandsworth, and so far as Battersea
there is nothing to make an impression, nothing to
remember. We must solace ourselves by thinking of
the water-picnics that Pepys went, sometimes with Mrs.
Pepys, but oftener by himself; and of the barges of the
bishops with their richly decorated canopies and the
long steady sweep of the oars in times considerably
earlier than Pepys'. The river pageants and the old
barges have been described so often, and so much has
been written about them from time to time, that we are
here concerning ourselves more with the river as it is
than as it was.</p>
   <p><figure id="fig.056" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00056"><head>        BATTERSEA REACH

Taken opposite Turner's house, No. 119 Cheyne
                 Walk.</head></figure>B y <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, however, history asserts itself with a
force that cannot be denied.  We see in mental reverie
the gardens of Sir Thomas More's house, gay with
roses, reaching down to the water; we see the gorgeous
barge of the king, with others in attendance like a flock
of gigantic and unknown birds, waiting by the stairs,
while the monarch himself strolls up and down the
greensward with his arm round his chancellor's neck.</p>
  <p> Just above Battersea Bridge, where the river makes
a little bay, is a small house, sunk below the level of
the ground and dingy in appearance. Here Turner
came, under an assumed name, to revel in the sunsets
and their reflections on the river. But the scene does
not always show a smiling face at <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>; there are
days when a thick haze obscures all but objects that are
very near; when the river itself is flat and discoloured
like a bad looking-glass, with scarcely a ripple on its
oily surface; when the sun, a pale golden globe, shifts







 <pb id="p.157"  n="157"/>


about in it with the slight wash; and sea-gulls swoop
lazily to meet their own reflections on the surface.</p>
<p>  The quaint old church with its brown brick tower
--and white clock is a well-known object. The tower
was built in the latter part of the seventeenth century,
so Sir Thomas, who added a chapel to the building,
would hardly know it again were he to return. The
green trees of the gardens in Cheyne Walk hide the
narrow Row   where Carlyle lived.  The high, light
suspension bridge called Albert Bridge reminds us of
that at Hammersmith.  The long green line of Battersea
Park is on the south, and the trees on the <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> side
rise above the solid granite, giving only glimpses of the
charming houses of red brick in ancient style already
toned by age that are behind them. At this part we
may see in mid-stream  a string of barges with burntsienna
sails and hulls painted Noah's Ark greens and
reds, laden perhaps with piles of hay, floating lazily, or
it may be dragged by a fussy little black steam-tug, and
so low in the water that the wash laps over at every
yard. We used to see the pleasure-steamers with their
cargoes of people making black their decks, but now
these are no more a familiar sight.  <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> Bridge also
is a suspension bridge, a fine piece of work, and as we
near it we catch a glimpse of the old men's hospital
standing back behind a long expanse of grass, and bearing
in every line its date of the reigns of William and
Anne. Scarlet-coated pensioners may linger to watch us
pass, and the traffic of the 'buses flows unendingly across
the bridge.</p>

<pb id="p.158"  n="158"/>

 <p> I have seen <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> Reach bathed in the misty light
of a summer evening, when the rough-hewn barges are
softened by the opalescence of the atmosphere, and again
on a baking day of midsummer, when everything is
hard and staring. By the side of a hideous iron railing
and glaring footway is a clay-coloured working-man,
with his loose voluminous clothes lying on him in
disorder, and the red handkerchief falling from his
furrowed, sun-baked neck, sleeping a dead sleep of
drink or exhaustion, and down below on the foreshore,
uncovered by the receding tide, children paddle and
bathe, shrieking with delight at the feeling of the slimy
ooze, from which, so tradition goes, the lowest kind of
margarine is made!</p>
   <p>Water-works, gas-works, and chimneys line the next
part of the river, and, pity that it is, the Embankment
ceases, the road running inland not to emerge again,
with the exception of a strip near Lambeth Bridge, until
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> is passed. If the Embankment stretched
along the whole of the river's length we should have a
promenade unrivalled in Europe.</p>
    <p><figure id="fig.057" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00057"><head>WESTMINSTER TOWERS</head></figure>The new bridge at Vauxhall, and the Tate Gallery
 are conspicuous before Lambeth Bridge is reached, and
 then we come to a spot dear to artists, and to all who
 have an eye for scenery. Here we find a bay and a
 foreshore. The dull blues and greens and rusty browns,
 associated with barges, are seen in plenty on the muddy,
 shingly incline, and beyond rises the Victoria Tower of
 the Houses of Parliament, grand and stately.</p>
    <p>The less said of Lambeth Bridge the better. As we








  <pb id="p.159"  n="159"/>


pass under it, the dark red brick and stone-capped
battlements of Lambeth Palace are close at hand.
Close in one sense, but much farther than they were
in the days when the water lapped up around their
base, and the empty niche in St. Thomas's Tower held
the image of the saint almost overhanging the flood,
to which the boatmen used to touch their caps. The
grey stone of this tower and of the adjacent church
contrasts well with the brick.  In mid-stream  are
strings of barges at anchor, laden with coal and timber
and other commodities. Between Lambeth and <placeName key="Westminster ">Westminster </placeName>
unhappy wretches, who had incurred the
penalty of the law by a heinous crime, were dragged
across at the tail of a boat! The ferry here has made
  this a crossing-place from time immemorial, and before
that was, in harder, more reckless times, the ford, when
men waded through thinking little of the danger and discomfort.
The river was much wider then and shallower,
and stakes guided the pilgrim from where the marshes
began, about where Buckingham Palace is now, down
to the river near the Abbey. The quaint towers of <placeName key="St.
John's Church">St.
John's Church</placeName>, " an elephant upside down," appear on
the northern bank, and <placeName key="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName>  is seen in
a blue-grey haze behind the Houses of Parliament. If
it be the time of sunset, and the sun be going down in
a sky of angry yellows and reds, then every buttress
on the Houses stands out in gilt on sepia.
We have a picture showing us the river just below
<placeName key="Westminster Bridge">Westminster Bridge</placeName> as it was in <date value="1751">1751</date>-a gay scene.
Two fine ladies fan themselves in a small rowing-boat

in the foreground, while several barges shoot about
on the stream in various directions; in some of them
men stand up at the prow to " discourse sweet music,"
if they were capable of it. A gallant hands a lady into
a boat at the steps where now are the neat little pier
houses, and work-a-day barges and boats are bestrewn
in quantity sufficient to satisfy the artist's fancy. The
Houses of Parliament, up to the rebuilding, seemed a
medley of buildings seen from the river. Dominating
all the roofs rose <placeName key="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</placeName>, and at the south
end, no mean rival, St. Stephen's Chapel. But trees and
roofs at every angle and height fill in the foreground.</p>
  <p> <figure id="fig.058" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00058"><head>SUNRISE AT LAMBETH</head></figure><placeName key="Westminster Bridge">Westminster Bridge</placeName> was the second bridge at London

seemed to know when the question was first mooted, and
rose with a strong spring-tide, so that it flooded to a

no means the first time it had done so; in the reign of

The walls of the palace of Whitehall, with the stairs
and piers, have long vanished, as also the line of palaces
succeeding, whose garden walls curbed the flood of the
river in the same way as an embankment does. Charing
Cross railway bridge is frankly hideous. Beyond it
the river gives a great sweep round, so that for the
moment the first sight of St. Paul's leads one to suppose
that it has been landed by mistake on the wrong








 <pb id="p.161"  n="161"/>

side of the water! But as the course of the stream
curves, it shifts back imperceptibly, and we have a
vision of its beautiful dome and lesser towers, rising,
it may be, in the clear blue of a spring sky, itself
softened with the blue-grey cloudiness to be seen in
an opal. Of the Strand palaces that formerly lined
the water-side, some mention has already been made;
not one, alas, remains.</p>
  <p>The long range of the upper storey of Somerset
  House looks as if it were covered by hoar-frost;
and a medley of smoke-coloured stone, red brick,
and green leaves carries us onward to Blackfriars,
where the London that most people know ceases, and
the sternly work-a-day commercial line of wharves
begins. Poor Thames Street, how hast thou fallen
from the days when princes of the blood, royal dukes,
and mighty men walked thy stones! From the days
of palace and fortress and noble tower and turret!
   Thames Street can still show some beautiful peeps,
 -note that at Queenhithe, with St. Michael's spire
 behind,-but it is overweighted, crushed, by the huge
 monster of Cannon Street station, which lies behind
 Southwark Bridge.</p>
 <p>  With Southwark Bridge we are reminded of the
 London over the water, of which so far, since Lambeth,
 there has been little or nothing to say. Now we are
 passing Bankside, where stood some of the earliest
 theatres in London, also bear-baiting and bull-baiting
 gardens.  The Southwark side was the resort of
 numbers of the citizens, who very commonly employed


<pb id="p.162"  n="162"/>


the watermen to row them over, thereby causing great
prosperity to the fraternity, who at a later date cried
out bitterly, when they heard that theatres were to be
built on the north side of the river, that it would ruin
their trade. Nevertheless Southwark cannot claim the
first theatre, for when plays were no longer allowed in
the City in the time of <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, Burbage built a
theatre at or near Holywell Street in Shoreditch, and
at the end of the sixteenth century this house was
taken down, and all its building materials transferred
to the Globe, across the water at Bankside.  <persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>
's
company rented the Globe in <date value="1603">1603</date>, and the
great dramatist himself lived near the bear-garden.
Other theatres, the Rose, the Hope, and the Swan,
soon followed the first, and Bankside became noted for
its amusements and its taverns, most famous of which
was the Falcon. Like all theatres of the time, these
were constructed of wood and only partly covered, so
that the rain could fall upon the audience, who stood
in the pit or "yard."  At the other or east end of
Bankside were the houses of the Bishops of Winchester
and Rochester. Winchester House was magnificent,
having ten courts and a park of seventy acres. </p>
 <p> <figure id="fig.059" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00059"><head>AN ARCH OF <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>; TOWER
       BRIDGE IN DISTANCE</head></figure> The pinnacled tower of St. Saviour's rises conspicuously
 near <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>, marking the old religious
 house of St. Mary Overies.   The present
 <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName> is two hundred feet farther westward
 than its predecessor. With St. Saviour's at one end
 and the Fishmongers' Hall and the white tower of St.

  <pb id="p.163"  n="163"/>

which it is well worthy, its wide flattened arches of
white stone being graceful and simple.   Not until
we have passed under it do we see the finest modern
building Thames Street can show, that is, the Custom
House.   The frontage to the Thames, as it is now,
was erected in the worst period of style-<date value="1825">1825</date>,-but
it is nevertheless fine and dignified, and with the foreground
of the forest of masts and funnels belonging
to the ships that have come up through the Tower
Bridge, it presents a fitting picture of the receipt of
custom belonging to a great sea-nation.</p>
  <p> Of all the reaches we have passed, the next, between
London and the Tower Bridges, is the noblest; for,
see them at what point of view we may, under any
conditions, at any hour of the day, these two, the
ancient Tower and the modern bridge are picturesque
and satisfying to the eye of man. The great gateway
of the bridge guarding the entrance to the river, the
fortress that so long was stronghold, palace, and prison,
each in its way is symbolic of the sovereignty of the
great city.</p>
  <p> Below the bridge we are in the Pool, which has
been always a favourite subject with artists. Here are
the colours of the river in abundance, her beautiful
livery of olive-green and silver-grey, with its facings
of russet and drab. Steamers and barges, boats and
wharves are all alike clad in these tones, and all alike
softened and refined  by the atmosphere.    Fussing
steam tugs, clumsy leviathan dredgers, stupid slowmoving
barges, busy industrious steamers, make a



<pb id="p.164"  n="164"/>


world in miniature, and each vessel has a character of
its own. Where St. Katherine's docks now are, was
once the cloistral shade of a religious house for nuns.
Beside their ancient church, under the shadow of the
trees, within sound, it may be, of the rippling water,
lived women whose lives were secluded from all active
interests. They beheld the life of the water, but were
not of it. But before the day of the great outburst of
energy, the days of glorious " Eliza," their house had
been taken from them, and they had been dispersed.
When down the water started the ships that went to
fight the Spanish Armada, the ships on whom the
existence of England depended, they were no longer
there to see. When such men as Drake and Frobisher,
and Gilbert and Ralegh went out to find new worlds,
so that the heart of every boy leapt with longing,
St. Katherine's stood dismantled, but still beautiful, a
ruin that we should have treasured and jealously guarded
had it remained until our time.</p>

  never live to see. They were going to new lands, to
carve out careers of splendour for themselves; their sun
was rising, his was setting; and as the vessels melted
  into the greyness of the distance the boy perhaps
turned his face to the west, a symbol that his own
short day was drawing toward its evening-time.</p>

<p>To chronicle the names and residences of all the great
men connected with London would be a task beyond
the powers of any mere mortal, at least if those who
have lived in London at any period of their lives were
to have a place in the hierarchy. If we took only the
statesmen who have governed England, and who by
virtue of their office have come to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, their
names would furnish forth many a volume. Clearly
the area must be more circumscribed.</p>
   <p> A lesser ambition might be to enumerate those who
 are in reality Londoners, men born within the limits of
 the great City, her own children, and not those adopted
 sons and daughters she has made her own by right of
 residence; by this means we should exclude such men as
 <persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>
 and Carlyle. Yet even so the task would
 be too great, the burden too heavy to be borne; selection
 must be made. Therefore, considering that this book
 is of London first, and of her history and her life, it
 has been thought advisable to choose men eminent for
 genius, who are Londoners in the most characteristic




<pb id="p.170"  n="170"/>
sense, whether by birth or adoption, and who have
lived in London at intervals of a century more or less,
so that we may trace the growth of London in their
lives.  For this purpose we have selected <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>,

<p>   It would be difficult to name one street principal
above all others in the London of to-day, there are so
many chief in their own department, be it in the world
of fashion or of trade; but it would be yet a greater
problem to ninety-nine Londoners out of a hundred to
name what was undoubtedly the principal street in old
London, the London within the walls. When it is
named they will no doubt have a vague idea that they
have heard of it before, but they will not be able to say
if it exists, and still less where it begins and ends. <figure id="fig.062" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00062"><head>VIEW FROM WATERLOO BRIDGE</head></figure>This
once principal street, Thames Street, does exist, and to
walk down it in the day-time is dangerous. Huge
cranes swing overhead, threatening to descend upon any
luckless skull, yawning trap-doors gape for unwary feet;
brawny men, intent on their own ends, jostle loiterers
aside, and a step into the roadway would possibly bring
destruction beneath the wheels of some mighty dray.</p>
  <p>  The Thames Street of to-day, as may have been
gathered, is not inordinately wide; it is lined on one side
by wharves, through which glimpses of the grey-green
river may be seen. Alas, one of the prettiest of these







<pb id="p.171"  n="171"/>


   peeps was done away but a few years ago! This was
   at Paul's Wharf, on which was a house projecting over
   the water, in the old style, and with a strong-room, a
   real old-fashioned strong-room, dating from before the
   days of banks or " running cashes," down below. The
   strong timber uprights of the wharf framed as charming
   a bit of river scenery as London could show. Now it
   is gone, all gone, and Paul's Wharf has been added to the
   new brick structures standing at intervals by the side of
   the Thames.</p>
      <p>The only time to explore Thames Street with safety
   to life and limb is on a Saturday afternoon, or on a
   Sunday, when, if the day be fine and sunny, the peaceful
   houses throw long shadows on the causeway, and it
   is easy to imagine one has been transported into the
   quaint, narrow, irregular street of some old Continental
   town.</p>
   <p>Yet nothing is left of the real old Thames Street as
   it was in the days of its glory; it was all swept away
 in the disastrous Fire, and long before that the magnificent
 palaces and princes' houses that lined it had
 fallen into decay.</p>
  <p> Let us reconstruct the street at the time when the
   poet <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>, the little boy who was to bear the proud
 title of the "Father of English Poetry," was born
therein.</p>
      <p>Not far from the station of St. Paul's at Blackfriars
 Bridge is a small and narrow dock called appropriately
 enough Puddle Dock; here the water laps about the
 green lichened posts, and gently covers or lays bare


<pb id="p.172"  n="172"/>


the slimy mud, as day by day the tide creeps up and
recedes. This was at one time a place of vast bustle
and importance; lading and unlading went on all day
long, as the goods of London were sent abroad, such
things as iron, wool, and hides from the earliest times
and later manufactured materials, and imports were
freely landed. Not far from Puddle Dock stood the
mighty castle of Baynard, built about the time of the
Norman Conquest, and held at the date of <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s
birth by the Earls of Clare. The castle had been dismantled
in the reign of <persName key="King John">King John</persName> in revenge for its
owner's taking part with the Barons, but the Earl had
been later forgiven and had rebuilt his stronghold.
After <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s time it was to be burnt down and
again rebuilt completely, on a slightly different site, and
it was to witness the proclamation of <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>., the
acceptance of the crown by his sons' murderer, and to
be a residence of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. But those days were
not yet, for <persName key="Edward III">Edward III</persName>. was on the throne.</p>
  <p>  <figure id="fig.063" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00063"><head>THE FORESHORE AT SOUTHWARK</head></figure>
The house of <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s father, who was a vintner,
 was at the beginning of Lower Thames Street, hard
 by the site of the present Cannon Street station, and
 not half a mile from the castle of Baynard. This
 and the neighbouring tower of Montfichet, the stern
 walls of Bridewell seen across the Fleet, with the
 monastic houses of Black and White Friars, must have
 been familiar objects to the small boy as he loitered in
 the street. Not so agreeable a sight, and one that must
 have struck any one sensitive with disgust, was a place
 near at hand where the butchers of the city used to




 <pb id="p.173"  n="173"/>


throw the reeking remains of the carcasses of killed
beasts into the water; but an order was made in the
reign of <persName key="Edward III">Edward III</persName>. that this disgraceful practice should
be abolished, and the remains otherwise disposed of.</p>
      <p>Two or three large houses followed Baynard's Castle,
one of which was taken from the abbey of F&#x00E9;camp
by <persName key="Edward III">Edward III</persName>. and given to Sir Simon Burley. At
   Paul's Wharf there was a free right of taking water, a
right disputed in <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s day when an attempt was
   made to get rents from those who so used the wharf.
   Near this there was another great house called Beaumont's
   Inn, and not far off was the house of the abbots
of Chertsey.  Near Broken Wharf was a large mansion
or castle belonging to the King's brother, Thomas, Earl
   of Norfolk, and then came the great Port of Queenhithe,
 where fish was continually landed in enormous quantities.
   East of Queenhithe was the Vintry Wharf, where the
 merchants of Bordeaux landed their wines, and it was not
 far from here that <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> the vintner, known to posterity
 as the father of his son, lived. It is of little advantage
to enumerate further the line of great houses by the
river in Thames Street, or to note in detail the houses
   of the well-to-do merchants and citizens farther inland,
 above which rose the splendid Cathedral of old St. Paul's,
   and near it the Bishop's Palace. Enough has been said
   to show what the street was like in the time of <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s
   boyhood : a fashionable street, full of coming and going,
   where men-at-arms and knights and esquires were
   continually to be seen, where gallants in blue and gold
   and silver paraded up and down amid busy merchants


  <pb id="p.174"  n="174"/>


and the lading and unlading of goods. People always
coming and going, always some sight, some scene to
look upon; an ideal place to live according to a boy's
notions, but hardly the place where one would imagine
the growth of a poet. Here the boy lingered on
holidays and on his way to and from school; here he
listened to the disputes about the water and the butchers'
offal; here he learned to know by sight the princes
and princesses of the Royal household. Not far northward
was Tower Royal, where Queen Philippa kept her
Wardrobe, and with which <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> was to become very
familiar in later days. Of all the splendid houses in this
part the only one standing which would be familiar to
<persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>, could he revisit the scene, would be the
Tower. <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s father was evidently well-to-do; it is
even supposed that he held some Court appointment
himself in earlier life. He was able, at all events, to
give his son a good education.  Yet the vast gap
between those times and our own is instanced by the
petty details of life, such as the fact that paper was
not then in use, forks not thought of; at a dinner two
persons shared one plate; even in a well-to-do household
the furniture would be of a rough kind, trestle
tables, wooden benches and trenchers. <figure id="fig.064" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00064"><head>LAVENDER WHARF. ROTHERHITHE</head></figure><persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> must
have been seventeen or thereabouts, according to the
latest researches, when he entered the service of the King's
son Lionel, Duke of Clarence, as a page. Thereafter he
moved about with the household of his master, seeing
Windsor, Woodstock, Hatfield, and many another
place. In <date value="1359">1359</date> he went on an expedition to <placeName key="France">France</placeName>,





  <pb id="p.175"  n="175"/>





and  and took his part in the war. His life was full and eventful,
a life of observation spent among men and things.
He was soldier, courtier, and man of affairs as well as
poet. We know his outward aspect sufficiently well:
   a short, stout man, with small head and hands, a forked
 beard, and a habit of looking "ever on the ground ";
   yet those downcast eyes took in all there was to see,
   and were shrewd with wondrous observation. </p>
    <p> We pick up the thread of his life again, so far as
   we are concerned, in his residence over the gateway at
 Aldgate in <date value="1374">1374</date>. He was then in prosperous circumstances;
 he had married Philippa, supposed to have
   been Lady of the Chamber to the Queen; he enjoyed a
   pension from <persName key="John of Gaunt">John of Gaunt</persName>; and he had been appointed
   Comptroller of the Customs.  Besides all these marks
   of grace he had the right to a special pitcher of wine, to
   be received from the hands of the King's butler every
   day. He had the lease of the upper storey and cellar
 of Aldgate on condition he kept the building in repair.
Here he remained for twelve years.     Though his
   married life was apparently not happy, we can imagine
 him well contented, writing his poems, visited by his
 friend Gower, and going to and from the Custom House,
   which was rebuilt at the end of his time of service, and
stood farther east than the present one. During this
period of his life he wrote a great deal, including the
  poem of " Troilus and Cressida," and several of those tales
  afterwards incorporated into the famous Canterbury Tales.
Of course these were copied out by hand, for the days
of printing were not yet.  <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> also went abroad

<pb id="p.176"  n="176"/>




frequently on diplomatic errands, so he had certainly no
cause to complain of his lot. In <date value="1382">1382</date>, <persName key="Richard II">Richard II</persName>.
having been then on the throne about five years, he was
further appointed Comptroller of the Petty Customs.
But his prosperity did not last. In <date value="1386">1386</date> he was
dismissed from  both offices, whether for incapacity or
merely by reason of the caprice of the times is not
known. It is supposed also that his wife died about this
time. However, he still held two pensions, the second
one being from the King. He left the gatehouse, and
where he lived in London or elsewhere is not known;
probably he travelled about England or went on his
pilgrimage to Canterbury. Three years later he was
appointed Clerk of the King's Works, in which capacity
he had charge of the King's mews for falcons at Charing
Cross, a place we have already visited. He held this
office for two years only, giving us reason to suspect
that, like most geniuses, he was not satisfactory as a
man of business. He received another appointment as
Forester from the Earl of March, and in <date value="1394">1394</date> <persName key="King
Richard">King
Richard</persName> gave him an annuity. Up to <date value="1399">1399</date> his place
of residence cannot be traced. He was in London
certainly several times to receive his pension, but
whether he lived there or not there is no means of
  knowing. <figure id="fig065" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00065"><head>FROM WHITEHALL COURT</head></figure>
In <date value="1399">1399</date> King <persName key="Henry IV">Henry IV</persName>., the son of a
  former patron,<persName key="John of Gaunt"> John of Gaunt</persName>, ascended the throne, and
  gave him an additional pension, so that he must have
  been well off. He then leased a house at the east end
  of <placeName key="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName>, on the site now occupied by
  Henry VII.'s Chapel, but before he had been here a








<pb id="p.177"  n="177"/>

year he died, in October <date value="1400">1400</date>, and was buried in the
Abbey, near which his last days had been spent.</p>
 <p>  <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> must have been familiar to him, for he
had sat as " Knight for the Shire of Kent " in the House
of Parliament, and must often have been at and about
the Palace, then, with the Tower, the principal residence
of the King. Around the Abbey and Palace clustered
what there was of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and beyond a stream
running over the course of Gardener's Lane there was
open country with fields.</p>
 <p>  As for the Palace, it was a town in itself. In Richard
II.'s reign there were three hundred and forty-six artificers
living in the precincts; these, with their wives and
families, were the King's servants to make what he
required.  Of the commissariat department, clerks,
ushers, and so on, there were two hundred and ten, besides
an army of servants. Then there were chaplains,
scribes, stewards, accountants, maids of honour, pages,
and " valets." This town of people was surrounded by
a wall, and to this busy, crowded scene <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> would
have free admittance. For the last years of his life he
had been busy completing and collecting his Canterbury
Tales, and doubtless these were read aloud and much
enjoyed at Court.</p>
 <p>  From the beginning to the end of his life <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>
had been closely connected with London, and we may
fittingly end with his own words:-
  Also the citye of London that is to me so dere and sweete,
in which I was forth growen; and more kindely love have I
to that place than to any other in yerth.

 <p> The gap between the times of <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> and <persName key="Spenser">Spenser</persName> is
enormous, not so much if measured in years, though
one hundred and fifty years elapsed between the death
of one and the birth of the other, but because the discovery
and rapid growth of printing in the interval had
transformed England. Where <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s works were
slowly and laboriously copied out by hand on vellum,
<persName key="Spenser">Spenser</persName>'s were sent to the printer to be struck off in any
number of copies. <persName key="Spenser">Spenser</persName> had access to books, which
were but as names or unknown to <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>; to him lay
open the whole field of literature. The output of the
printing presses in <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s time was immense, and
all the books were new; there were no reprints, but
everything was fresh; the whole field of literature was
accessible. We see the result of this in the brilliant
outburst of literary, and especially of poetic, talent: <persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>
,
Jonson, Marlowe, Massinger, Beaumont and
Fletcher, Ralegh, and many another poet. Sir Thomas
Browne, Francis Bacon, Stow, and Grafton among the
prose writers belong to this age, and all these names are
household words yet. In this wonderful world, this
world of learning and chivalry, this world of culture
and romance, <persName key="Spenser">Spenser</persName> took his place.</p>
 <p>   He was the son of a clothmaker who lived in East
 Smithfield, on the east of the Tower, not to be confounded
 with the much better known West Smithfield.
 His father was then working in the service of Nicholas




<pb id="p.179"  n="179"/>

Peele of Bow Lane. The date was somewhere near
  <date value="1552">1552</date>.</p>
  <p>On one side lay the moat of the Tower and the strong
  walls of the citadel, and here, ere the boy could speak
plainly, Lady Jane Grey was beheaded and Princess
  <persName key="Queen Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> imprisoned.  From  his earliest years the
  going to and fro and the beheadings of the State
  prisoners must have formed the theme of the conversation
  around him, and the vast crowds gathered on the
  green slopes of Tower Hill to witness executions must
  have been a familiar sight. Northward from the Tower
  ran the Town Ditch, that Town Ditch into which the
  citizens emptied all their refuse, and which constantly
  needed cleaning. At Smithfield itself there was an open
  space where on Aggas's Map a woman is represented
  drying clothes, and to the north and to the south were
  the dismantled religious houses, St. Katherine's by the
  Tower, Eastminster, Holy Trinity Priory, and others.
  Some of the churches still stood. Here was a bit of
  cloister, there an enclosing wall, but all the houses were
  now turned from their uses and stood forlorn. This
  revolution of things that had seemed as firm as the
  mountains was still fresh in the minds of men. Beyond
  Smithfield were open fields all the way as far as eye
  could see to where the little church of Stepney stood
  on the horizon.</p>
  <p>On his way to the newly founded Merchant Taylors'
  School in Suffolk Lane, Dowgate, the boy would pass
  over the Ditch, threading his way through the streets
  with their wooden houses and by many a spired church.


 <pb id="p.180"  n="180"/>



The school was not far from <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge </placeName>, and after
school hours, no doubt, he, among others, would hurry
down to the old bridge with its narrow deep arches and
wonderful houses; he would envy those who lived
above the rushing flood, and long to live there too.</p>

There is still an outfall here of the Tyburn stream
      which used to turn the Abbots' mill.</head></figure>His school was part of the fine old mansion of The
Rose, which had been held by the Earl of Hereford,
the Dukes of Exeter and of Buckingham, and many
another noble, and at intervals by the Crown. Even
as a schoolboy the lad wrote verses, and very shortly
after he left, a collection of poems, now generally
considered to have been from his pen, though issued
under a false name, appeared in print. He went from
school to Cambridge University, and afterwards stayed
in the country with relatives, until in <date value="1578">1578</date> he became
a member of the household of the Queen's favourite,
the Earl of Leicester. The Earl then occupied the
house adjoining the Temple, later known as Essex
House, and partly on the site now covered by Essex
Street. The Strand was then in the fulness of its glory,
and had replaced Thames Street as the fashionable
quarter, for in London fashion ever shows a tendency
to move westward. Here were the splendid palaces
of the nobles we have already noticed, Arundel and
Somerset Houses, Durham and Worcester Houses, and
others. In his daily life <persName key="Spenser">Spenser</persName> was brought into
friendly relations with many a brilliant courtier, many a
cultured gentleman, and formed friendships with Sidney
and Ralegh that were only ended by death. Sidney
was nephew to the Earl of Leicester, and no doubt a








<pb id="p.181"  n="181"/>


frequent guest at his house. Ralegh was at that time
probably occupying Durham House, which had been
granted to him by the Queen, and was within a short
walk of his friend; and but a little farther westward was
York House, where, some twenty years before, a man,
who was to earn a greater name than he, Francis
Bacon, had been born.</p>
   <p>The Shepheard's Calendar was written and published
and the Faerie Queen begun while the poet was at
Leicester House.  In <date value="1580">1580</date> <persName key="Spenser">Spenser</persName> was appointed
secretary to Lord Grey de Wilton, who was going as
deputy to Ireland, and though he revisited England later,
from this time Ireland remained his residence until shortly
before his death. He came back after the rebellion of
<date value="1598">1598</date> a broken and ruined man; his house had been
burnt and his possessions destroyed by the rebels. He
took lodgings in <placeName key="King Street">King Street </placeName> (p. 91) in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
and died there. Ben Jonson, his famous contemporary,
and a Londoner too, having been born in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
declared that he perished for lack of bread, which must
have been an exaggeration.  In any case it is certain
that his last days were embittered by want. Yet that
the nation was not unmindful of his genius is shown by
the fact that he was buried in <placeName key="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName>, only

 <p>    <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> is the third of that wonderful line of London
poets who stand out pre-eminent in genius. He was


<pb id="p.182"  n="182"/>


faithful to his mother city, and never left her but of
necessity, and then not for long. He was born within
the walls of the City, he had at different times ten
residences in London, and by the whole cast of his
mind he was a Londoner of the Londoners. Very
familiar must the streets have been to the pale, dignified
man, noted for "temperance, sobriety, and chastity";
deeply must the scenes known from boyhood have been
engraved upon his brain, so that even after he lost his
sight he could see them with the "inward eye."  He
was born, as every one knows, in <date value="1608">1608</date> in a house in Bread
Street, which, like all the other London houses with
which he was connected, has disappeared, though its
successor is marked by a tablet.   <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName>'s tender
feeling for the home of his youth is shown in the fact
that, when the house became his own property after
his father's death, he retained it, in spite of all vicissitudes
of fortune, until it was destroyed by the Great
Fire. It is exceedingly difficult for us to reconstruct
the London that <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> knew when he as a boy, with a
" thoughtful little face, that of a well-nurtured towardly
boy," came out of the house to go to school in St.
Paul's Churchyard. Every day he must have seen
a London where every vista was a picture in itself.
Above the houses hung signs, his father's sign being the
Spread Eagle. Timber and tile, plaster and carving
were the rule everywhere. Bread Street is narrow
enough now, so narrow that in working hours the huge
drays pass down it at a foot's pace, but it must have
been darker and narrower then.    Forth from  this

picturesque street the boy went to the school which
was to be so highly honoured by numbering him among
its scholars. " From the twelfth year of my age," he
says, "I hardly ever went to bed before midnight."
His brother Christopher was seven years younger than
himself. <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> does not seem to have made many
schoolboy friendships. Only one, that with Diodati,
is mentioned; probably <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> was a solitary boy, for
he was old for his years, and certainly of far higher
mental calibre than the ordinary boy. In his essay on
Education, written many years later, his curriculum
for the ordinary schoolboy includes Hebrew, Chaldee,
Syriac, and Italian. <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> himself had a splendid
memory and great facility in foreign tongues. He
passed on in due course to Cambridge, and afterwards
joined his father at Horton in Buckinghamshire, whither
the elder <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> had retired about <date value="1632">1632</date>. He does
not seem at any time to have had any pressure put
upon him to enter into a commercial life; indeed his is
one of the rare instances where parents seem to have
recognised the true worth of genius in a child, and let
him do what fancy prompted him; and it is impossible
to read of <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> at all without recognising in him the
calm self-possession which, without haste or scuffle,
took the position of superiority to which he was entitled.
It never seems to have occurred to him to " strive or cry
in the streets " ; from the first genius followed its own
bent, and went undisturbed upon its way. He stayed at
Horton until his famous tour abroad, and on his return,
as his younger brother was now living with his widowed

<pb id="p.184"  n="184"/>


father, <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> undertook the education of the fatherless
sons of his sister, Mrs. Phillips.  "He took him a
lodging in <placeName key="St. Bride's Churchyard">St. Bride's Churchyard</placeName> at the House of one
Russel a taylor," and here he remained until <date value="1640">1640</date>.
St. Bride's, otherwise St. Bridget's, was destroyed in the
Great Fire, but rose again after Wren's designs, and
stands still, hemmed in by houses, but visible from
Fleet Street. <figure id="fig.067" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00067"><head>ST. GILES', CRIPPLEGATE
     <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName>'s burial-place.</head></figure>His very short stay here, about a year,
was due to " necessity of having a place to dispose his
books in, and other goods fit for the furnishing of a
good handsome house, hastening him to take one, and
therefore a pretty garden-house he took in <placeName key="Aldersgate
Street.">Aldersgate
Street.</placeName>"  This house was in a court now called
<placeName key="Maidenhead Alley">Maidenhead Alley</placeName>, opening into <placeName key="Nicholl Square">Nicholl Square</placeName>, and
not far from the quiet church of St. Giles, where he
was at last to rest. He was now just outside the wall
and within the liberties of the City. Here he occupied
himself in training his young nephews, and after three
years, by a sudden and totally unexpected movement,
he took a wife from the camp of the enemy in the
person of Mary Powell, daughter of Richard Powell, a
staunch Royalist. This marriage was a disaster. The
gay young girl brought suddenly into a household so
austere as that regulated by <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName>, must have been
obliged to occupy her mind with high things, when
probably her first idea of a marriage and going to live in
London would have been an escape to a freer, more
joyous life than the quiet one of the country. She
shortly left her husband and went back to her own home.
During all the time he was at Aldersgate, <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName>









   <pb id="p.185"  n="185"/>

brought forth nothing but prose, in the form of tracts
and essays. Two years later, going to visit a kinsman
in St. Martin's-le-Grand Lane, where the General Post
Office now is, he was surprised to find his wife there,
and the meeting, arranged by her people, became a
reconciliation. He was at this time on the eve of
moving once more, though not very far,-the residences
chosen by himself being generally within the neighbourhood
of St. Paul's.</p>
   <p>The new house was in the Barbican, and here the
young wife once more took up her duties. This house,
long since vanished, formed the scene of many domestic
events. The whole family of the Powells, ruined by
the success of the Roundheads, came to seek refuge
with their Puritan son-in-law, and the result, as might
have been expected, was not successful. A man who
lived by line and rule, who loved quiet and was rigid in
all his ways, as <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> was, must have found himself
perpetually jarred by a household consisting of two
young nephews and other pupils, an uncongenial wife,
and a whole family of people-in-law. Here both his
own father and Mr. Powell, his father-in-law, died, and
his eldest daughter was born to him.</p>
  <p> Shortly after this <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> removed to a house in
High Holborn, "not since identified," leaving the
remainder of the Powells to find their own lodging.
Here he stayed until his appointment as Government
Secretary on account of his wonderful fluency in Latin,
in which language all State communications were then
made. This was in <date value="1649">1649</date>, and he took a house in



<pb id="p.186"  n="186"/>


Spring Gardens in order to be near his work, but was
very soon afterwards persuaded to remove to apartments
in Scotland Yard adjoining the rambling old
palace of Whitehall.</p>
  <p> In <date value="1652">1652</date>, however, he went to<placeName key=" Petty France"> Petty France</placeName> in<placeName key="Westminster "> Westminster</placeName>, now called York Street, and was there for
eight years. Here his youngest daughter was born, and
his wife died. He married again, and after a little more
than a year was left a widower a second time. He had
lost the sight of one eye when he came to  <placeName key=" Petty France">PettyFrance</placeName>,
and two years later was totally blind, though he still
retained his Government post with the aid of an
assistant. It is noticeable that his love of gardens
always led him to a garden house, or one in which there
was easy access to an open space. The house which
he occupied in <placeName key=" Petty France">Petty France</placeName> stood until <date value="1877">1877</date>.  It
must, in his time, have been an ideal residence, for it
overlooked St. James's Park, in which he was free to
walk. The Park was then a mere common, with grass
and trees growing irregularly and a few small ponds;
it was not until after the Restoration that it was put
into shape by <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. When the Restoration was
announced, <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName>, as one who had ever been a prominent
Puritan, was forced to go into hiding, which he
did without quitting London, staying for some time
in the house of a friend in Bartholomew Close, Smithfield.
The danger over and amnesty proclaimed, he
came forth; but he did not return to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
probably because it was in proximity to the Court, but
took a house again in Holborn temporarily.  From


<pb id="p.187"  n="187"/>



here he went back to near his former quarters at
Barbican, renting a dwelling in Jewin Street. His eldest
daughters were about thirteen and fifteen at this time,
and their unfilial conduct made a deep and bitter
impression on their father. It is but fair to say that
when the girls are spoken of with reprobation, allowance
has hardly been made for their youth, their
motherless condition, and their disadvantages under
such a stern father as <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> must have been. It is
natural that they should have revolted from tasks they
abhorred, such as reading aloud languages they did not
understand, and that when called up in the night to
take down verses whereof Dr. Garnett says, "not one
of which the whole world could have replaced,"
their sleepy eyes and ears should have failed to
appreciate the beauty.  In Jewin Street, however,
<persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> cannot have had an unhappy time, for his
friends Andrew Marvell and Thomas Ellwood, the
Quaker, frequently called on him; he was occupied in
the great work which was to place him supreme as
" prince of poets," and he brought home his third wife,
who seems to have been just the sort of pleasant, goodtempered
person to be a suitable companion for a genius.
After two years in this house he moved to his last
London residence in Artillery Walk, near Bunhill
Fields. The house had a small garden both back and
front, and here he finished Paradise Lost. In July
<date value="1665">1665</date> he left London to escape the Plague, and went
to Chalfont St. Giles, in Buckinghamshire, where stands
the only one of his numerous houses that still remains

<pb id="p.188"  n="188"/>
to form an object of pilgrimage. Yet he retained the
house in Bunhill Fields, and here he returned when
London was reduced to a heap of ashes. The Fire had
stopped before Bunhill Fields, but the air must have
been thick with lamentation and crying, and the one
topic of conversation must have been of the great
disaster, the result of which <persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> could not see. We
have several word-pictures of him as he was at Bunhill
Fields, one "sitting in a coarse grey cloth coat at the
door of his house, in warm, sunny weather, to enjoy the
fresh air," again indoors, "in an elbow chair, black
clothes, and neat enough, pale but not cadaverous, his
hands and fingers gouty and with chalk stones." In
his sixty-eighth year he died quietly, and was buried in
the chancel of St. Giles, near which his home had been.
His tombstone may be seen there, and a bust of him,
executed by the elder Bacon.</p>
  <p>  After the account of the lives of these three how
 ludicrous sounds Heine's exclamation: " Send a philosopher
 to London, but for your life no poet! "

  interesting is the reconstruction of London. Yet the
  London of <persName key="Dr. Johnson">Dr. Johnson</persName> was in many respects as
  different from our own as that of the Stuarts or
  Tudors. We have only to look at the old prints, of
  which there are many, depicting the Strand or Charing
  Cross to realise that London was then below the level





<pb id="p.189"  n="189"/>

  of some sleepy old provincial town of our own day,
  though Boswell did speak enthusiastically of its animated
  scenes. The streets were paved with rounded cobbles,
  and the noise of the iron-tired wheels of the high
  coaches and heavy carts rattling over it must have been
  deafening. There were posts along the side of the
footways, and the footways themselves so narrow that
  ladies with the huge hoops of the period could not
  possibly pass any one they met, and even when they had
  the whole pavement to themselves had to use a graceful
  sideway movement to prevent their hoops wiping all the
  mud and filth from every post. Along the houses,
  nearly all of which had balconies overhanging the street,
  were an assortment of signs of every hue and design,
  swinging and creaking in the wind.    There were
  hackney coaches to be had, but the river was still the
  universal highway, and on it plied numbers of covered
  boats called tilt boats, that ran from stairs to stairs and
  conveyed people as omnibuses do now. Fashion had
  deserted the Strand, as it had before deserted Thames
  Street, and had moved westward; all the part about
  Mayfair was filled with the new houses of the wealthy,
though Hyde Park Corner was the end of London in
this direction. Belgravia was still " The Five Fields,"
with the Westbourne stream  flowing through them.
But far more strange than any details of buildings is
the fact that the men of that century, so comparatively
near to our own time, went to see the Tyburn executions
as a show, and viewed with indifference the spiked
heads on Temple Bar.    To this London, Johnson



<pb id="p.190"  n="190"/>


came as a man of twenty-eight, and took lodgings in
Exeter Street, Strand. He was at this time married,
but had left his wife behind him. He was unprepossessing,
big, loose-jointed, clumsy, marked with
scrofula, blind of one eye, and with a terrible affliction
which made him involuntarily twitch his limbs and
roll his head; but he was common-sense incarnate,
with the common-sense that is akin to genius, and his
broad brain recognised no limits to the possibilities of
acquirement. He had very little money, and dined for
eightpence, " a cut of meat for sixpence, and bread for
a penny, and gave the waiter a penny," and thus made
his first acquaintance with the London taverns which
were to play so large a part in his life.</p>
 <p>   The east end of Exeter Street has vanished before the
 onward march of great Kingsway and Aldwych, and
 <persName key="Dr. Johnson">Johnson</persName> would be sadly puzzled if he found himself in
 the neighbourhood now. He was only a few months
 in Exeter Street when he returned to Lichfield, and on
 coming back to London subsequently he brought his
 wife with him. Their lodgings were for a time in
 Woodstock Street, near Hanover Square, and afterwards
 in Castle Street, near Cavendish Square. There was of
 course then no <placeName key="Regent Street">Regent Street </placeName>. Bond Street was in
 existence, and Great Swallow Street ran right through
 between <placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> and <placeName key="Oxford Street">Oxford Street </placeName>. When they
 lived near Hanover Square they were almost in the
 country, the houses to the north of the Oxford Road
 being confined to a few streets about Cavendish Square,
 and reaching northward to Marylebone Gardens, a place


  <pb id="p.191"  n="191"/>

of entertainment, while northward and on either side there
was nothing but fields. <placeName key="Dr. Johnson">Johnson</placeName> now worked for Cave
on the Gentleman's Magazine, and spent his time at its
offices in Clerkenwell Gate. Clerkenwell Green had
been, but a short time before his acquaintance with it,
a fashionable place, surrounded by large houses with
gardens, one of them belonging to the Duke of Newcastle,
but it had fallen from its greatness, and many
of the houses were let in tenements.</p>
   <p> To follow his various movements in detail would be
 unprofitable, so a list of his lodgings and residences is
 appended, as Boswell preserved it to the world; and
 we go on to that life in Fleet Street with which he is
 peculiarly associated :-</p>
    <p>Exeter Street, Strand, <date value="1737">1737</date>; <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>, <date value="1737">1737</date>; Woodstock
       Street, Hanover Square, <date value="1737">1737</date>; 6 Castle Street, Cavendish Square, <date value="1738">1738</date>; Boswell Court; Strand; Strand
       again; Bow Street; Holborn; Fetter Lane; Golden
       Anchor, Holborn Bars, <date value="1748">1748</date>; Gough Square, <date value="1748">1748</date>;
       Staple Inn, <date value="1758">1758</date>; Gray's Inn, 1 Inner Temple Lane,
       <date value="1760">1760</date>; 7 Johnson Court, Fleet Street, <date value="1765">1765</date>; 8 Bolt
       Court, Fleet Street, <date value="1776">1776</date>.
   It will thus be seen that he altogether outnumbered
<persName key="Milton, John">Milton</persName> in his London residences.
   <persName key="Dr. Johnson">Johnson</persName> was the spirit of eighteenth-century London
incarnate. No man so " clubable" as he, no one who
understood so perfectly the art of interesting and
amusing the men who gathered round the tavern
tables.  Clubs were at first intimately associated with
taverns, and their object was purely social. A man of


<pb id="p.192"  n="192"/>


that date would look with surprise on the clubs of the
present day, where solitude is considered to be one of
the inalienable privileges of members, and for one man
to address another without good cause little less than an
affront. In Johnson's day to sit down at the same table
with a man in a tavern was an introduction; clubs were
established for the purpose of intercourse, not aloofness,
and in the extraordinary outburst of literary and
conversational ability at his date there must have been
many things that passed in clubs which would have been
well worth preserving in permanent form.</p>
  <p>

<figure id="fig.069" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00069"><head>THE SHOT TOWER, ETC.</head></figure>
</p><p> <persName key="Dr. Johnson">Johnson's</persName> first residence near Fleet Street was in
Gough Square, where he began his great dictionary;
later he was in Johnson's Court, and then in Bolt Court,
where he gathered together the forlorn folk who had
somehow crept within the protection of his great heart.
His Government pension of &#x00A3;300 a year was well employed
in housing so large a family of such incongruous
items. Established near his beloved Fleet Street, Johnson
had found his corner; though he travelled to Paris,
Wales, and Scotland, and on many a lesser excursion, he
knew that London was native to his spirit, even as Lichfield
was his native place in the body. In spite of his
strenuous work and enormous output he was constitutionally
lazy, and when not forced by necessity, loved to
pass his time in idling. This is the account given of
his day by one who knew him :-</p>





<pb id="p.193"  n="193"/>



   <p><quote rend="blockquote"> About twelve o'clock I commonly visited him, and
  frequently found him in bed or declaiming over his tea, which
  he drank very plentifully. He generally had a levee of morning
visitors, chiefly men or letters; Hawkesworth, Goldsmith,
Murphy, Langton, Steevens, Beauclerk, etc., and sometimes
learned ladies, particularly I remember a French lady of wit
and fashion doing him the honour of a visit. ... I never
could discover how he found time for his compositions. He
declaimed all the morning, then went to dinner at a tavern,
where he commonly stayed late, and then drank his tea at
some friend's house, over which he loitered a great while,
but seldom took supper.
</quote></p>
  <p>His favourite tavern was the Mitre in Fleet Street,
which stood on the site of part of Hoare's Bank.
Here he met Boswell and Goldsmith and other intimates,
who affectionately spoke of him  as the "big man."
The Turk's Head Coffee-house in the Strand was
another favourite resort, and after the formation of the
Literary Club in the Turk's Head, Gerrard Street, Soho,
he went there. This club was an epitome of the society
then to be found in London; the list of its original
members includes besides himself and Goldsmith, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, who helped him to found it, Edmund
Burke, Nugent, Topham Beauclerk, <persName key="Sir John Hawkins">Sir John Hawkins</persName>,
Chamier, and Langton, and the names of the members
within a few years included those of Gibbon, Adam
Smith, Garrick, Sheridan, Lord Palmerston, <persName key="Charles Dromore">Charles Dromore</persName>
James Fox, the Duke of Leeds, and the Bishops of
, Killaloe, Clonfert, Peterborough, and Salisbury.</p>
  <p> Johnson's excessive tea-drinking-he is said at one
time to have consumed twenty-five cups at a sitting and
his sociability were prominent characteristics as well
as his kindliness of heart. He delighted in going to

<pb id="p.194"  n="194"/>

places of amusement in good company, but he was
equally zealous in his attendance at church. His pew
in St. Clement Danes is marked by a brass plate.</p>
 <p>  Boswell tells us that he and <persName key="Dr. Johnson">Johnson </persName>once took boat
at the Temple stairs and were rowed to Old Swan stairs,
and then walked to Billingsgate, thence again by boat
to <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>, where he read aloud from    the Doctor's
London the words :-</p>
     <p><quote rend="blockquote">   On Thames's banks in silent thought we stood,

at hand to soothe his self-love, with the society of such
intellects as those mentioned, with kind friends like the
Thrales, and the sense of his own great and worthily
recognised ability, we can imagine that in spite of all
his engrained melancholy <persName key=" Dr. Johnson">Johnson</persName> managed to enjoy his
life. His utterances in regard to London were always
those of warm eulogium :-</p>
<p><quote rend="blockquote">   Sir, if you wish to have a just notion of the magnitude of
this city, you must not be satisfied with seeing its great streets
and squares, but must survey the innumerable little lanes and
courts. It is not in the showy evolutions of buildings, but
in the multiplicity of human habitations which are crowded
together that the wonderful immensity of London consists.</quote>
</p>
   <p> He confessed that London was "too big"; what
 would he have said to the huge city now?</p>
 <p>   Again, he observed that a man stored his mind better







<pb id="p.195"  n="195"/>

  in London than anywhere else; no place cured a man's
  vanity or arrogance so well as London, for as no man
  was either great or good per se, but as compared with
  others not so good and great, he was sure to find in the
  metropolis many his equals and some his superiors.</p>
   <p> " You find no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave
  London. No, sir, when a man is tired of London he is tired
  of life; for there is in London all that life can afford." "There,
  and there alone, a man's house is truly his castle."</p>

Bayham Street, Camden Town, where the boy was a little

his wide topographical acquaintance with London began
then, for he often visited two uncles, one at Limehouse,
and one in Gerrard Street, Soho, and his wanderings backwards
and forwards to these two made a deep impression
on his mind. When the family moved to 4 Gower Street
North, a new era began. His father was carried to the
Marshalsea, and the poor sickly little lad was employed
to make bargains with pawnbrokers and to sell books to
second-hand dealers. He sank still lower in being put
to work in the terrible blacking warehouse so vividly
described in David Copperfield.  This was at Old
Hungerford Stairs, near Hungerford Market, where
<placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> railway station now is, and the boy in
his wanderings during the dinner hour grew familiar
with every court and lane in the neighbourhood. The
market was then in a dilapidated condition, and was
rebuilt seven or eight years subsequently, and ten years
before <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName>'s death he saw it superseded by the
railway station. At the time when the delicate,
exquisitely sensitive little boy worked at this toilsome
occupation, Northumberland House still stood in its
glory; <placeName key="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square </placeName> had not been begun, but a
  network of dirty slums stretched over the ground near
  the church, and the Royal Mews were still to be seen
  where the fountains now play.</p>

  taken from Camden Town, where he had been sent to





<pb id="p.197"  n="197"/>


lodge on the removal of the family from Gower Street,
and was allowed to lodge beside the Marshalsea Prison,
with which he became thoroughly acquainted. The
Marshalsea has now completely vanished, but its site
may be known by Angel Court, the first narrow passage
north of St. George's Church in the Borough High
Street.</p>
   <p>When the family were released from the debtors'
prison they went to Hampstead, then to Seymour
Street, then to Bentinck Street, Manchester Square,
while <persName key="Charles">Charles</persName> attended an " Academy" in the Hampstead
Road as a day boy for nearly two years, and
afterwards worked for a while as a clerk in Gray's Inn.
Later he was engaged as a reporter at the House of
Commons, the old House of Commons, of course, where
the Prince's Chamber, the Painted Chamber, the Star
Chamber, and St. Stephen's Chapel still formed part of
the group of buildings representing the old Palace of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. Three years after <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName>'s first
connection with the House all these were swept away in the Great
Fire of <date value="1834">1834</date>. <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> had chambers in Furnival's Inn
for a time, on the north side of Holborn. It was not
an old fabric, having been rebuilt in <date value="1818">1818</date>, and now it
has completely gone, its site being covered by the large
red buildings of the Prudential Assurance Company.
In <date value="1837">1837</date> he went to Doughty Street (No. 48), close to
the Foundling Hospital. He was now a married man
with a son; here he remained for two years, and then
went to Devonshire Terrace, near the Marylebone
Road. <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> found inspiration in the turmoil of the

 <pb id="p.198"  n="198"/>


London streets, which has driven many another writer
to despair. When he was abroad he literally craved for
the streets.  "Put me down on Waterloo Bridge at
eight o'clock in the evening," he wrote, " with leave to
roam about as long as I like, and I would come home,
as you know, panting to go on" ; and again at Lausanne
he says he finds production at a rapid pace a great difficulty.
" I suppose this is partly the effect of two years'
ease, and partly of the absence of streets and numbers of
figures. I can't express how much I want these. It
seems as if they supplied something to my brain which
it cannot bear when busy to lose."  In <date value="1850">1850</date> he moved
into Tavistock House, Tavistock Square, which he sold
after ten years, when he made Gadshill, Rochester, his
permanent residence.</p>
   <p>In his life <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> saw many changes in London; for
example, every one of the great London railway stations
was built; South Kensington practically came into existence
with the great Exhibitions; <placeName key="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square </placeName>, as
we have said, was made; Barry's wonderful Houses of
Parliament rose on the ashes of the old ones; New
<placeName key="Oxford Street">Oxford Street </placeName>, <placeName key="Charing Cross Road">Charing Cross Road</placeName>, and Shaftesbury
Avenue demolished many terrible slums, including the
district of Seven Dials, which, though still partly standing,
is rendered comparatively harmless by the neighbourhood
of broad and respectable thoroughfares. The
Fleet Prison and the Marshalsea were abolished. Just
before his death the new Law Courts were begun, and
many another improvement was made. Abuses were
shown up by his vigorous pen, and he himself may be


 <pb id="p.199"  n="199"/>

  considered the incarnation of the spirit of a time when
  men began to regard humanity and cleanliness as first
  principles.</p>
     <p>We have been made acquainted with the few selected
  as representative men of their age, but there remains
  yet the vast army of those who by birth or adoption
  have been the children of London, and whose names
  are associated with dwellings in her streets. What a
  magnificent host it is : men of letters, statesmen, artists,
  actors, poets, architects, and others! Even to give
  representative names is a huge task, and the list below
  is in no sense intended to be exhaustive or to indicate
  that there are not variations in ability high as the
  mountains or deep as the seas. Yet listen to the roll-call
  of this splendid regiment as it marches past :
  Camden, Bacon, <persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>
, Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones,
  Isaac Walton, Cromwell; these by birth belong to the
sixteenth century, Cromwell indeed being born only
within its last year. Sir Thomas Browne, Evelyn,
Dryden, Pepys, Sir Isaac Newton, Strype, Sir Godfrey
Kneller, the Duke of Marlborough, Defoe, Swift,
Addison, Steele, Gay, Pope, Richardson, Hogarth:
these are the contribution of the seventeenth century.</p>
  <p> Fielding, Pitt, Hume, Gray, Horace Walpole, Garrick,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, Goldsmith, Burke,
Romney, Savage, Fox, Sheridan, Mrs. Siddons, Samuel
Rogers, the Duke of Wellington, S. T. Coleridge, Lamb,
Turner, Hazlitt, Palmerston, De Quincey, Kean, Byron,
Cruikshank, Shelley, Keats, Hood, and Carlyle were
born in the eighteenth century, though of course, as in

<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>

previous lists, those near the end of the century belong
by right of their lives to the succeeding one. Macaulay,
Lord Lytton, Beaconsfield, Darwin, Thackeray, Browning,
Leech, <persName key="Eliot, George ">George Eliot</persName>, and Ruskin, not to mention
names of living persons, are in the roll-call of the
nineteenth.</p>
   <p>These lists, as said at the beginning, are not intended
to be exhaustive, but show something of the diversity of
talent, the splendid record of this the greatest of cities.

<p>THE street life of London can only be illustrated by
the slightest of vignettes; it would be easy, perhaps,
to invent scenes full of excitement, but they would not
show the streets as they are day by day, and these are
what one wants.</p>
   <p>Take Bow Street about mid-day. What a curious
medley it is! Along the pavement comes marching a
solid file of sturdy, clean policemen, wholesome and
healthy, and good to look upon, going to report themselves
at the Bow Street Station. Round the corner,
with that peculiar fussiness assumed by the workingclass
woman when she is on an errand of importance,
come two women dressed in their very best clothes.
The elder is stout, and has a hat laden with crape, but
in style suitable for a much younger woman ; her dress
also is black, with crape sewn on vertically in lines; the
younger is not quite so stout, and though evidently in
mourning too, has not been able to resist wearing a bit
of rabbit fur round her neck; by her side is a small boy,
obviously uncomfortable in his stiff Sunday grey suit,



 <pb id="p.204"  n="204"/>



and half awed by the solemnity of the occasion, half
self-assertive. He makes a run for the entrance to the
police court, but is dragged back and steered round to
another entrance at the back. Evidently it is not the
first time the stout woman in crape has been there, for
she knows her way about. On either side of the street
shops full of theatrical properties, such as wigs of various
colours, glittering false jewellery and other requisites,
alternate oddly with the open shops or stalls, where
fruit is sold wholesale, and where consequently the
vendor puts on an air of leisurely unconcern altogether
different from the active energy of the retail man. A
group of theatrical young ladies outside the stage door
blocks the pavement; they are altogether rather highpitched
in colouring, tone, and style, and they chatter
freely with several men of the same calibre. A highly
respectable newspaper office belonging to one of the
great dailies ends the street, and beside it a newsvendor
sells his wares, making a free display of them on the
pavement.</p>
  <p> At the same hour the eating-shops in the Strand
and elsewhere are crowded, "A.B.C.s" and "Lyons"
being highly in favour. They are largely patronised by
the clerks from the offices near, for here wholesome
food may be purchased at a marvellously cheap rate.
Every one chooses to suit his pocket, from the officeboy
who has a steaming large cup of coffee and a " milk
scone," though it is not in the least what a Scot would
understand by a scone, to the young man who spends a
lordly shilling on pie and potatoes, with prunes and


<pb id="p.205"  n="205"/>


 cream to follow. Day by day the place is ever full,
 always the same class of people, the same smell, the same
 food.  It may be noted as a curious trait that the
 Londoner likes his food well seasoned, and of course as
 he likes it he gets it. Popular taste approves steak and
 kidney pie radiating essence of dried herbs, apple pies
 thick with cloves, and milk puddings with nutmeg;
 even the veal and ham pie is not without its flavouring,
 and in addition to these condiments mustard is largely
 used.</p>
   <p>The young ladies who serve are trim and neat and
self-possessed, though not without a demure smile for a
favoured customer. The average of marriages in this
class is very high, so that though the pay is not, there
are always any number of applicants for a vacancy. It
is strange how the use or rather misuse of the word
" lady " has grown with strides of late years; every
shop-girl is now a young lady, and the American joke
about the "washer-lady" will soon cease to have any
significance. There is some peculiar saving clause about
the qualifying adjective "young," be it noted; whatever
the age of a shop-assistant, she is a " young lady,"
and, further than this, shopmen are beginning to be
spoken of by one another as "young gentlemen," a
term formerly used exclusively by servants and hall
porters to denote public-school boys.  Whether the
qualifying adjective will remain as a saving grace or
be altogether discarded, so that all classes save real
gentlewomen and gentlemen will become "ladies" and
"gentlemen," remains to be seen.</p>



<pb id="p.206"  n="206"/>


   <p><figure id="fig.072" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00072"><head>SOUTH END OF WATERLOO BRIDGE</head></figure>
In the matter of shops I have often wondered how
they can all exist. The prosperity of the large ones, of
course, and the well-known ones can be understood
There is much money in London; witness the extraordinary
celerity with which any fund mounts that has
touched the public sympathy. An anonymous donor
gives, it may be &#x00A3;100, on condition that twenty others
do the same, and very shortly the sum is made up; others
give enormous sums to charity, &#x00A3;20,000 and &#x00A3;50,000
as easily as an ordinary man gives half-a-crown. Yes,
there is much money in London, and those who have
it like to have the best of everything, and care not what
they pay, so that the large shops and the fashionable
shops are well supported. The most fashionable are
oftentimes the least ostentatious; none of the Bond
Street shops has a large window space, and in some of
the streets leading off Bond Street it seems to be considered
aristocratic to make as little display as possible.
Madame, who orders a " little thing" at fifty guineas,
does not need to see similar garments displayed in the
window in order to ensure her custom; in fact, she
prefers her own to be unique. It is not the smart shops,
nor yet the large modern store-shops where everything
can be obtained under one roof, that have difficulty in
keeping themselves financially afloat, but rather the
small shops with a fairly large window space, shops that
pay comparatively high rents, have a large staff of
assistants, and yet sell cheap goods. In these everything
is cheap, from the tea-gown at 19s. 11 &#x00BE; d. to the
"pearl" pins at 1&#x00BE;d. the dozen, and everything, lace,






 <pb id="p.207"  n="207"/>

fur, and jewellery, is all sham. These shops are getting
more and more behindhand, as the people from the outlying
streets and the suburbs come up to London to the
well-known ones, and their takings must sometimes be
very meagre. It is pitiful to see the row of expectant
girls and the obsequious shopwalker with his "What is
your pleasure, madam ?" and to hear the order, it may
be a reel of black cotton and a hair net ! Such shops
are soon " competed " out of existence, and the business
tends more and more to the store-shops.</p>
  <p> Let us take another scene where the characteristics of
Londoners come out strongly. It is a damp, foggy
November afternoon, not a real fog, but enough to
distil depression and paralysis of energy as the thin
solution of dirt and moisture is distilled in a meagre
rain. From a seat near the door of an omnibus a long
vista of flickering street lamps can be seen shining on
the wet roadway. Inside Waterloo Station things are
not much better. There is a certain amount of bustle, but
also a good deal of dejection. We come suddenly upon
a group of persons, numbering quite a hundred and
fifty, standing on the grey cold stone pavement of the
station, all staring in one direction, and seemingly afraid
to move their eyes for an i stant. Such an eagerness
has one seen in a crowd facing a cinematograph, or
even, in unsophisticated districts, a magic lantern, but
here what all are staring at is a large indicator with the
names of the places from which expected trains are
coming, and blank spaces for the numbers of the platform
at which such trains will arrive. It is now 4.20,

<pb id="p.208"  n="208"/>

and you may note that the 2.30 has not yet arrived.
These people have been waiting here nearly two hours,
it is impossible to doubt it, waiting patiently and without
exasperation; the fog has delayed the train, the railway
officials can give no idea when "she " will be in, and
they have friends to meet, possibly friends from the
country who would be lost if they arrived alone in the
whirlpool of London, and therefore wait they must.
They cannot move, fascination holds them there; when
the magic number appears they have only time to race
across bridge or roadway and be in at the arrival of the
train. While we watch a number is put up, not that of
the 2.30 for which the whole crowd seems to be waiting,
but of a less important one ; some straggling members
of the group detach themselves and hurry away; the
rest close up their ranks, and their eyes are still fastened
on the indicator. There is not a single seat within sight
of the indicator, which stands in the draughtiest, least
interesting part of the station. Were there seats to sit
on, or a large bookstall to amuse the weary, matters
would be improved; but no, there are none of these
things, and yet the stolid Londoner complains not; he is
used to "putting up" with things, and has long learnt
that he cannot make the world go round to suit his own
convenience. While we watch the crowd a tired woman
with a heavy sleeping child in her arms, who has been
shifting from one foot to another, makes her way to a
seat at some distance, but, finding she cannot possibly see
the indicator, returns almost immediately.  A train
comes in at this platform, and a detachment of privates

  <pb id="p.209"  n="209"/>

 alight ; they are eagerly awaited by their sweethearts, and
 for a few minutes there is babel of chatter, then the men
 form up and march out, leaving the wistful girls, who
 have spent two hours in expectation of a glimpse of
 them, to go home through the wet streets. A Sister of
 Mercy passes with white flapping cap; she paces up and
 down, up and down austerely, with her eyes on the
 ground. Two small lads, having a penny to put in a
 slot machine, spend a happy ten minutes debating
 whether chocolate, dates, or figs will yield the most for
 the money. At last, at last, up goes the number, the
 crowd disperses hastily, there is a rush for the stairs,
 over the bridge, and patience is rewarded.</p>
   <p>Such a scene suggests many things to a student of
human nature, but chiefly those qualities for which the
Londoner is famous, his tolerance and good-humour.
It is the first lesson he learns. Coming perhaps from a
home where he has been of some importance, and where
his wishes are at least considered, he is plunged into a
mass of men like himself, and becomes one among
hundreds. His wishes, his convenience affect no one;
he may get angry, he may, if he be of the educated
class, write letters to the papers complaining of his woes,
but if he be of malleable mould he soon gets this
knocked out of him, and he learns to put up with
things. The marvellous patience of the streets we have
seen exhibited by the omnibus men, but the average
Londoner has his share of the quality too.</p>
  <p> Take another street scene. It is a week-day evening;
the pavement is sticky and the street greasy ; the garish


   <pb id="p.210"  n="210"/>

light of a public-house at the corner struggles with and
overcomes that of a wan moon. Groups of workmen
in soiled clothes are standing at the street corner, and
more of them are in the public-house. A knot of
Salvationists are holding a meeting in an entry, with a
lamp propped up on a tripod to give them light, and
their harsh voices ring out above the thunder of the
passing omnibuses. On the Nonconformist Chapel hard
by is a huge placard, a couple of yards deep, announcing
that next Sunday the Rev. Mr. Hardapple will discourse
on " Hell and what We may expect There."  A
woman comes along dressed in black, with a certain
worn neatness in her apparel; she looks timidly in at
the glass door of the public-house, then swings it open
with a defiant push that would be bold were it not so
nervous. A tiny red-haired, left-handed boy is playing
a joyful game all to himself, kicking his much too large
slippers off against the wall of the house, and trying to
catch them as they rebound. Two larger lads, with
heads close together, are eating fried fish out of a piece
of newspaper; presently they throw the empty paper
into the kerb and go away; the small left-handed
boy pounces upon it with glee, and licks it with great
enjoyment. Presently a weary-looking youth wheels
up a coster barrow on which is a small baby; he lifts
the child off, and sets it down on the wet pavement,
tips up the barrow in a dark passage, and picking up the
child as if it were a parcel, strides into the passage,
obviously a widower, or worse. Another young man of
the same type, with a worn face and a half-silly expression,

<pb id="p.211"  n="211"/>

 as if he were " not quite all there," comes round the
corner with a bundle in his hand. He goes into the
public-house, and, unrolling his parcel, discloses a much
soiled and worn pair of boots; finding no satisfaction
within, he returns to the street and offers the boots to the
working men, who examine them critically; one even
measures them against his own foot, others tap the soles,
but no one buys, and the young man goes wearily on
his way. A blind man taps the kerb impatiently to
attract attention, but none of the working men stir;
presently the small boy runs across and leads him over
the dangerous crossing. Two smart, dapper artillerymen
stop for a moment in passing, and cheekily mimic two
girls of the loosely bloused, dishevelled type, who pass
on grinning at the witticisms. An old grizzled cabman
pulls up at the kerb before the public-house and gives
his mare her nose-bag, speaking to her meantime more
affectionately than maybe he has ever spoken to his
wife. Then he counts his gains, a good big fistful of
silver, and goes in to " have a glass."</p>
  <p> A knuckle-kneed horse wearily tugging at a laundry
cart stops with a jerk, and the man driving it descends;
he has his wife and baby with him, seated among the
great bags of linen, and he fetches her out a glass of
porter, "with a head on it," before they go on again.
The barman saunters about outside for a moment, the
picture of good-natured vulgarity, the very man for the
place, big, and not too squeamish, ready for anything,
from  a passing joke to the "chucking out " of an
obstreperous customer.</p>



 <pb id="p.212"  n="212"/>




   <p>By this time the Salvationists have departed, and
a barrel-organ comes upon the scene and begins an
excruciating tune. Two girls spring up from somewhere,
and begin twirling each other round and round
on the wooden pavement. Then the tune changes to a
schottische, and half a dozen young fellows and other
girls join in, but all dance strictly with their own sex,
men with men, and girls with girls, a kind of deliberate,
rather slow toe-and-heel movement ; as the music grows
faster the crowd gathers, and people come out of the
public-house to watch the performance. The bus-drivers
drive benevolently on the far side of the street not to
interrupt the fun, but the carts and cabs are not so
considerate, and the dance is frequently broken into.
Suddenly the weary grinder stops, and out come
handkerchiefs, and there is much mopping of faces;
the street ball is over. Thus run out the lives of the
poor in mean streets after working hours are over.</p>
  <p> Take another view. It is a glorious August afternoon
  at the Oval. Abel is in, having nearly one hundred
runs to his credit, and the score stands at over two
hundred for two wickets. To any but an enthusiast
the game might seem a little bit monotonous, but not
so to the Surrey crowd ; they are real cricket-lovers; it is
the game, the strokes, they care to see; they know to
a nicety how many the popular little hero wants to
complete his thousand in first-class cricket, and when
he gets it a cheer will break out simultaneously with
as great a verve as ever it would for the winning stroke
in a match. In the sixpenny seats there is no sitting

<pb id="p.213"  n="213"/>

  room; every available inch of hard backless bench is
  packed, and at the back many men stand for hours on
  the grilling asphalte. Pocket-handkerchiefs are slung
  from bowlers and caps to shield the necks from the
  sun, but the faces are hot and red and perspiring all
  the same. It is a good-humoured crowd too; there is
  no grumbling, no selfishness displayed; the men edge
  up just that extra half-inch that makes all the difference
  between fair comfort and real discomfort, with all the
  pleasure in life, if thereby some one else can sit on an
  unoccupied fraction of seat at the end. The chaff goes
  on all the time, and also remarks on the game, showing
  that every one is intent on the cricket, and nothing
  else. A limping little man who comes round with
  refreshments in the shape of packets of lemon drops tied
  up in white paper, and carried in a shiny black leather
  bag, does a roaring trade; every one seems to have an
  odd copper to spend. Every one also has already paid
  sixpence for entry to the ground, and yet it is a working
  day, no half-holiday, and these men one and all are
of the working class. Here is a Guardsman admitted
free by right of his uniform; his being here is
understandable enough, but next to him is a clerk; what
does he do here in the middle of the afternoon ? He
is too well dressed to be out of work. Next to him
is a man who is a plumber, if ever plumber was written
on a man's outward appearance; a row of nondescript
youths, evidently in some trade, follow; they may be
men who have night work, compositors or the like,
but the whole of the thousands that surround the

<pb id="p.214"  n="214"/>



ground cannot have night work, and the fact of their
having sixpence to spend on pleasure speaks eloquently
of the fact they are not out of work.     Go any
day, every day, all through the summer, and you
would swear it was the same identical crowd, though
it may be made up of different units. The problem
is insoluble. A vast sea of men and lads, well fed and
comfortably dressed, with money in their packets, and
the great majority wearing that strip of stiff white
linen which in London is the outward and visible sign
of respectability. Allow for the soldiers, the shopkeepers,
the compositors, the railwaymen, and you
have yet hardly touched the fringe of thousands who
assemble day by day just to watch cricket.</p>
  <p> <figure id="fig.073" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.029.DO01.00073"><head>THE WESTMINSTER EMBANKMENT-WINTER EVENING</head></figure>The fogs of London are too characteristic of the
great city to be omitted without comment. There
are many varieties of fog, by no means to be confounded
with one another by the real Londoner; there
is, for instance, the white fog, the yellow fog, the black
fog, and the fog that hangs overhead but does not
descend. The last named is very curious; suddenly,
without warning, the darkness of night falls upon a
part of London, maybe only a small part, for this kind
of fog is apt to be local; electric lights spring out on
all sides, and working London continues its task without
intermission. The streets are clear, there is no
difficulty in transit, but overhead like a black pall
hangs the fog until the wind wafts it away. </p>
 <p>  The white fog is very often the most opaque,
 though the air is quite light, and there is no need of





 <pb id="p.215"  n="215"/>


artificial lights. This fog hangs in thick folds, as if
layers of linen were before one's face. One involuntarily
tries to brush it away; it is provoking not to
be able to see in a good light; it seems to muffle sound
too, more than the others, and crossings are dangerous.</p>
  <p> The yellow fog happily is not common; it is choking,
stifling, and creeps into rooms and houses in spite of
all efforts to keep it out. The atmosphere can only
be compared to the Underground at its worst, that is
to say, at Blackfriars or Gower Street. The ordinary
black fog is the most common; this may or may not
be opaque, according to its density ; at its worst it is
very dangerous indeed.   One is isolated, an atom
certain only of the foot-space on which one stands;
cabs crawl by the kerb, omnibus conductors lead the
horses, holding the lamp in their hands and going
slowly foot by foot. The lamps are seen as round or
oval discs emitting no rays, and at a few yards' distance
they vanish altogether; the roadway is greasy with
precipitated moisture, and the footpaths disgusting.
Here and there, where the Underground Railway runs
in a cutting, is heard the hoarse bark of the fog signals.
There is a feeling of weirdness, of menace, over all, as
if something terrible were about to happen. </p>
 <p> Yet, considering the situation of London, it is hardly
to be wondered at that all devices for minimising the
fogs have failed entirely. London is built on marshes.
So much have artificial buildings and roads of man's
making swept away natural outlines that it is seldom
realised that we are on the marshy banks of a river.

The land slopes very gradually up from the bed of the
Thames to the heights on the north, and the slopes
were aforetimes traversed by numberless rills, and by
at least four streams of some magnitude, namely the
Westbourne, Tybourne, Fleet, and Wallbrook. Picture
this locality many years ago when man had not planted
his city, that was to be, on the river-side. The Thames
then flowed over a far wider channel than at present; it
made its way to the sea in a vast shallow stream, here
and there breaking into lagoons and swamps, or completely
cutting off the part of the land by surrounding
it, as at the island of Thorney, where is now <placeName key="Westminster ">Westminster</placeName>.
Here is Sir Walter Besant's account: " There
was as yet (after the Roman period) no <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
but in its place a broad and marshy heath spread over
the whole area now covered by the City of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
Millbank, St. James's Park, <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, and as far west as
Fulham. Beyond the wall on the north lay dreary
uncultivated plains, covered with fens and swamps,
stretching to the lower slopes of the northern hills.
All through this period, therefore, and for long after,
the City of London had a broad marsh lying on the
south, another on the west, a third on the east, while
on the north there stretched a barren swampy moorland."</p>

A SNOWY MORNING, WHITEHALL</head></figure>Picture it, this broad bed of the river extending
over many acres, and lined by low marshy ground
liable to inundations. From this valley there rose
continually a winding-sheet of thick white mist, extending
far to north and south, and it is this mist which,




<pb id="p.217"  n="217"/>
now mingling with the smoke of man's making,
becomes fog.</p>
   <p>The fog is ofttimes very local. It may be quite
clear in the City and dense in Kensington, or dense in
Soho and clear at <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>; but some spots are peculiarly
liable to be enshrouded, and of these one is that part of
<placeName key="Piccadilly">Picadilly</placeName> from Devonshire House to the Circus. If
the fog is at all general it is always to be found here at
its worst.</p>
  <p> Turning for a while from the fog, which is a peculiar
London characteristic, and world-wide in its notoriety,
we may consider London under another aspect, that of
snow.   We do not often have heavy snowfalls in
London. When we do, armies of men with spade and
shovel set to work to clear it off the pavements; it is
carried away in carts and cast into the river, but not
before the passing traffic has churned what lay on the
roadways into a peculiar rich-brown paste, which spurts
up from the flying wheels. Snow exercises a deadening
effect on the atmosphere; it seems to muffle the sound
rays as the fog does the light rays. The vehicles are
ghostly silent, making no noise, the air is still, even the
shrill whistle of the street boy seems a tone lower than
usual, and the city shows itself under a new aspect.</p>
  <p> Let us finish with a few notable points in the
demeanour of the "man in the street." His manners
are as a rule good; it is much easier to pass down a
busy London street than even a quiet provincial one;
every one is quick to perceive the intention of those he
meets, and gives a little for his own part; there is no

<pb id="p.218"  n="218"/>

bucolic slowness. Where there is mind there is always
to some extent manner, for mind supposes imagination
and the power of realising another's position; hence
in crowded tram or in the Twopenny Tube there is
seldom need for a woman to stand long before a seat
is courteously offered.</p>
   <p>The policeman must be mentioned. In the eyes of
a Frenchman he occupies a place second only to the
Lord Mayor in any conception of London. For this
his dignity is largely responsible, and dignity, whether
natural or acquired, is a valuable asset in these days of
easy familiarity.</p><p>

</p>
   <p>With this we may end this general and discursive
survey of the London we have tried to depict, the
London of the streets and of the people; the work-a-day
London of mud and fog, but of glowing golden-red
sunsets; the London that holds an unrivalled heritage
in its historical records and names of its noble sons; the
London that has won the hearts of the people as no
great city has ever done before.</p>
