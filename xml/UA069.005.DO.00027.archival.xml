<div1 type="preface" n="PREFACE" id="front001">

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
  <p>IN the year <date value="1818">1818</date> I published a volume similar to the present, having the same objects, but differing in the manner of execution. That task was imposed upon me in consequence of some
"Hints," which had been previously communicated to the public through the medium of a popular publication, at the instance of its Editor. Of both performances I have spoken at large in the <hi rend="italics">sixth chapter</hi>, in which are introduced copious extracts from the last mentioned, explanations of my first inducement to think of such matters, and an apology for the guise assumed in composing the volume alluded to.</p>
   <p>It was in the nature of that volume that its most practical parts should soonest become inutile; the facts therein adduced, and the deductions drawn, being applied to improvement, to the abatement of error, the annihilation of crime by precautions, and the correction of a mistaken policy-its pages would necessarily effect their own obsoleteness. The same will happen to this volume, also, in process of time; wherefore I entertain the idea of producing an-
<pb id="p.iv" n="iv"/>                other such at no distant period, in which the early parts will be condensed into simple precepts, to make room for enlarging upon other topics, which have been omitted altogether, or sketched much too slightly in the present-the black-legs, the highflyers, the haut ton, and the literatists, for example.</p>
  <p>The Critics, I perceive, spoke in terms of approbation of the former volume. I am sure they did not ground their judgement so much on the style of execution as its practical utility; for it was uniformly ill done as to letters, by the frequent use of vulgarisms; and even now I have persisted in adopting the terms and phraseology we have, for the most part, heard applied to the business described, or that seemed to characterise the persons engaged; with what taste the reader must decide-I only looked to effect. But there were other critics than the periodicallyprinted self-appointed censors of literature, from whom I heard of commendations that were infinitely more gratifying to my mind: the voluntary uninfluenced praise of one magistrate would weigh more than volumes of monthly or quarterly lucubrations, even though he had not been himself the man of letters, a real English gentleman, a person of discernment and a sound
                                <pb id="p.v" n="v"/>
 lawyer. Yet I never exchanged a word with him on the subject, chiefly on account of those very commendations; and I since discover, that he is much fonder of the emoluments of his office, than the trouble it engenders.</p>
<p>Should the careful reader meet with repetitions of the same facts, or of similar reflections, he must attribute these to the circumstance of more persons than one having been engaged in the collection and elucidation of the facts here brought together. On some occasions, the employment of the plural (WE) instead of the singular
(I) has reference to the same circumstance; at others, it may be taken as the potent WE of concealed authorship. If the writer has any where spoken with apparent levity, he will not be suspected of deriding sufferings that are impersonal; nor, when he descends to describe any <quote>very excellent trick</quote> of dishonesty, or <quote>charming mode of flooring</quote> a victim, he apprehends he cannot be misunderstood as recommending either practice, by any one who has dipped into Swift's Advice to Servants, <quote>over the left;</quote> studied Fielding's Life of Jonathan Wild, the great; or partook of Beresford's happiness at <quote>the Miseries of human life.</quote> Yet must it be conceded, that teaching by irony is like flogging school-boys

<pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/> with liquorice-root, or inviting a beau, surcharged with trinkets, to the pleasures of an Old Bailey exhibition; from both which, even the leastwise would turn away if he could, however high the gratification might seem to the inflictors.</p>
  <p>No fiction of the brain, no imaginary character, make any part of these pages, though I may not always hit the exact orthography of proper names; whereby offensive underlings of grovelling dispositions, may find holes to creep, as they are wont, from the censure of their own contracted circles; and although I may have adopted a popular cognomen instead of a christian name, or legal denomination, yet I protest against, as I utterly eschew, all attempts at teaching this most perilous of all worldly  knowledge,   by  the  machinery   of
<quote>pretty novel</quote> or <quote>amusing narrative,</quote> to which some excellent cerebral writers of the present day seem fondly addicted ; <note place="foot" n="1"><quote>Life in the West</quote> is the very best of these, and supersedes an entire chapter which I had devoted to the subject. I had, also, for years acted strenuously and effectively against the Hells, as the reader may conclude upon consulting <quote>the Annals of Sporting,</quote> passim, and No. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 39, particularly. My chief antipathy against the scoundrels was, that they called themselves sportsmen; whence I infer the ruin they wrought they considered sport. Yet I could not see with what propriety the writer just cited could inveigh against <quote>Crockford's subscription-house,</quote> though I could easily understand why the newspaper scribes should yelp at this or any such a place, that did not pay them for quietism. A handsome sum subscribed by each of twelve hundred gentlemen, including in that number many of the Magnates of the land, would be a good guarantee to unprejudiced minds, that legism would not prevail there, however it might creep in and get kicked out.
</note> those modern
 <pb id="p.vii" n="vii"/>

 Bunyans, who couch whatever they write
<quote>under the similitude of a dream.</quote> Here and there, I find I have carried this plain-spoken, unvarnished openness of mine to the extremity, in the severe rebuke of some full-grown fool, or arrant actual knave, who stands at the head and foremost of his class. But I have no apology to make, <hi rend="italics">to them</hi>, at any rate. In some few cases I am not sure that I did not intend to give pain; but then, this disposition has been amiably restricted to fitting objects: the censor of scoundrels, the expositor of villainies, cannot be supposed capable of being conciliated by the filthy pretensions of him who dares to expect complacencies that belong only to the virtuous; he even fancies too much when he hopes to escape with negation from the pen that is confessedly castigatory.</p>

  general Glance at Town Life and Manners</head>
  <p>AT his first entrance to <placeName key="?"><hi rend="italic">Town</hi></placeName>, as London is termed when the <hi rend="italic">living part</hi> of it is adverted to, <hi rend="italic">the Stranger</hi> is impressed with the bustle and confusion that every where prevails; and, as he passes along towards the centre, he is utterly at a loss to account what all the apparent hubbub and buz of voices, the runnings up and down, and crossings and jostlings, and rolling of vehicles among hardly-saved foot passengers can possibly portend. If he comes from a remote <hi rend="italic">borough</hi>, he imagines it may be' electiontime' or <hi rend="italic">market-day</hi>; is he from <hi rend="italic">a city</hi>, perhaps 'tis assizes that causes such an access of people; and he no longer is bewildered at their number, when he recollects the many compara-
<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>          <note type="header" place="head">STRANGER'S ARRIVAL.</note> tively deserted places he has recently passed through in his journey up to Town. If our Stranger's mind be of a lively inquisitive nature, his imagination thus fills up the chasm that wonderment has created with ill-assorted suggestions, or he seeks to obtain information from his fellow-travellers, some of whom know as little of the passing scene as himself; whilst here and there one or two old stagers contrive to mislead his unsophisticated curiosity by lies, and call it <hi rend="italic">fun</hi>; for 'tis <quote>a d-d good joke to quiz the countryman.</quote> To this they add certain opprobrious epithets, according nicely with the measure and fruitfulness of their education, in the designations of <hi rend="italic">Johnny Raw</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Greenhorn</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Youkel</hi>, whereby they hope to lessen his pretensions to equality with themselves on the score of town-knowledge, and throw a shade over his endeavours to become enlightened at their expense. <hi rend="italic">Cockneys</hi> of middling condition and minor acquirements, which constitute the bulk, are not communicative of useful information of any kind, unless they can enhance their own self-importance by the condescension; as far as regards the inquisitiveness of countryfolks concerning <hi rend="italic">their city</hi>, they are absolutely misintelligent, if not delusive, unless the party has some claim upon their patience and civility, or they hope to obtain public notice, or aggrandizement of some sort or other; and then they do not hesitate to walk bare-headed into the street for his accommodation, nor

<pb id="p.3" n="3"/>
        <note type="header" place="head">TRAVELLING ACQUAINTANCE.</note> withhold their beneficence in purse or table, or personal assistance, as the case may seem to demand. Herein lies the secret of those numberless subscriptions to annual or <hi rend="italic">occasional</hi> purposes, the majority whereof may be purely philanthropic; but very nearly the half are extorted by example, the desire to appear munificent, and the certainty of being <hi rend="italic">advertised</hi> in superior company, to which all emergents aspire. The ' people at Lloyd's' are here kept more immediately in view, who are, to a man, the " architects of their own fortunes."</p>
  <p>Whether our Stranger arrive by water- conveyance or land-carriage, he will lie open to the danger of forming an undesirable acquaintance with some designing <hi rend="italic">fellow-traveller</hi>, from the very circumstance of such abortive seeking after information on the road <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, who will insinuate himself to his good graces by apparent disinterestedness. Such a <soCalled>"fellow,"</soCalled> however, may be distinguished from a real <hi rend="italic">well-wisher</hi>, by the quantity and volubility of his speech, and exacerbated professions, its delectable emptiness, and the absence of his <hi rend="italic">real address</hi>, which may and should be put to the proof instantly; if fallacious, he will kick at the inquiry, if not so, then not. The great length and duration of a coasting voyage affords more opportunity for both species of deceit than the journey <hi rend="italic">per coach</hi>, by which latter kind of conveyance the greater number, by far, of new arrivals take place. To these, therefore, in the
<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>
    <note type="header" place="head">COCKNEY UPPISHNESS, FELT BY GREENHORNS; BUT NOT GENUINE.</note> order set down, I shall first address the appropriate information as to their safe conduct until the same observations apply equally to both. But, by whichever of these, or by whatever means he may reach London, or however long he may remain in it, he will never cease to feel the affectation of superior uppishness of the people among whom he sojourns concerning the affairs of <hi rend="italic">Town life</hi>. Let this be granted them, whether indigenous or denizen, and they claim the same superiority in all other matters, but in some one or other naturally get beyond their depth. Test a cockney how you may, he never declares his non- knowledge on any topic whatever, if he be <hi rend="italic">thoroughbred;</hi> but, as our stranger has already ascertained, no doubt, even before his arrival, will retort, by some <hi rend="italic">puzzle</hi>r of his own contrivance, or old saw borrowed from cockney-lore.</p>
  <p>Hereby they hope to administer to their own self-love; and well were it for the stranger if such annoyances relax as thejourney approaches its <hi rend="italic">finis</hi>, or ceases upon his being set down at his inn. But here new evils await him, arising out of the same causes, <hi rend="italic">namely</hi>, his <hi rend="italic">greenness</hi>, and the superior cunning, with its attendant dishonesty, of those among whom he must now mix and make his way. Part of these aim to possess themselves of his property, either by some cajolery, overcharge, or overreaching; others by way of trade, and a few by direct unblushing robbery. Nor do these attempts wholly
           <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> subside, when his protracted residence in town no longer subjects him to the sinistrous charge of being a <hi rend="italic">green</hi>, unknowing countryman, nor place him any more in the relatively disadvantageous situation of a raw, <quote>fit only to be acted upon by those who consider themselves <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> to every move upon <hi rend="italic">the board</hi></quote> of actual life. But he will not wait long for his revenge; very many of those long resident inhabitants, who may have acquired a good portion of <hi rend="italic">townknowledge</hi>, as well as the all-keen <hi rend="italic">thoroughbreds</hi>, find themselves very often overmatched by the superiorly cunning devices of the dishonest part of the community: <hi rend="italic">personal robbery</hi> occurs to both varieties, to the utter discomfiture of their uppish ideas, as often as to the new-comers; whilst their commercial concerns and other <hi rend="italic">fixed property</hi> are so frequently invaded by the burglar, the night prowler, andthe unfaithful servant or deluded menial, that the more liberal cockney, in advanced life, is free to confess that even he is <quote>not sufficiently
<hi rend="italic">up</hi> to every thing which is passing in the world,</quote> nor thinks it always the best that can happen; and he now hearkens with uneasiness to precautions, that in early life he would deride as practical foolishness, and in the middle course of it scarcely believe necessary. Experience has effected this much for his improvement, who in the precociousness of a warm soil, thought less than nothing the value of all worldly know-

  <p>The reader will already have discovered that we do but precede him by a very few years, and what we now teach, we once had to learn, like himself; closer observation, much painstaking, some leisure, and a taste for the thing, forming the only difference betwixt us. He will perceive the objects we have in view throughout the volume are, the guarding him against being plundered, in the first place (no mean attempt); in <hi rend="italic">the next</hi>, how to avoid personal contamination and danger himself, and to enjoy in security the intercourse of friendship;
<hi rend="italic">thirdly</hi> and generally, we would show him how to form an estimate of men, manners, and opinions in this vast metropolis, particularly <hi rend="italic">the active part of it</hi>, those whose actions operate in some way upon others; whereas, the unobservant
<hi rend="italic">recluse</hi>, unseen of his fellow mortals, for such there are <hi rend="italic">in Town</hi>; the mere man of <hi rend="italic">fashion</hi>, whose only circle is a butterfly meandring among the wo-begone <hi rend="italic">Bon ton</hi> like himself; the unobtruding <hi rend="italic">eccentric</hi> of sickly pursuits, and the useful, intellectual, unassuming <hi rend="italic">mechanic</hi>, however rich, all these are but negations in our presentscheme of exhibiting <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>; since those descriptions of inerts have betaken themselves out of the course of events, and live but to a limited few; their circle is circumscribed in narrow space, and we shall not dare the pene-

            <note type="header" place="head">PROPERTY GUARDED.</note> tralia of their seclusion; but let an individual among them <quote>come out</quote> upon the stage of
<hi rend="italic">actual Life</hi>, he shall not seek notoriety in vain;
<hi rend="italic">the press</hi> will resound his name for a day, or immortalise his memory for a week :-does he ask more ?-let him achieve it. Even the inactive <hi rend="italic">philanthropist</hi> of retiring manners, must <hi rend="italic">do</hi>
<hi rend="italic">good</hi> for its own sake, unheeded of our labours; since these are but worldly, his deeds of a more heavenly cast. Silent <hi rend="italic">melancholy</hi> never can weigh in the scale of the man of the world; nor outrageous <hi rend="italic">madness</hi> merit aught but pity, however well arranged; unless either, being religious, obtrude itself upon public notice, and endeavour to warp the public mind; or, being replete with schemes of ideal advantages, drag our youth to bleach their bones on the shores of Senegal, or bury myriads in the mines of Mexico, blast their hopes by the lightning of <hi rend="italic"><placeName key="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</placeName></hi>, or freeze the more hardy at the poles, unless they and their ships previously get squeezed, like nits, between immense icebergs. These are the cockney characters that require exposure and demand our execrations, if we can cease laughing at their fifty times exploded bubbles, and <quote>proposals for forming joint-stock companies</quote> for lunatic undertakings.</p>
  <p>The first part of the ensuing pages is mainly adapted to the occasions of such persons as may be supposed anxiously solicitous of guarding their property from depredations, to whom its preservation is essential, and its loss an

<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>

What safer keeping can their
<hi rend="italic">moveable personals</hi> be committed to, than their numerous attendants of the valet genus,- faithful coachmen, grooms, out-riders and Swiss
<hi rend="italic">avant couriers</hi>, with the stately porter, grooms, stable-boys, and helpers, for watch over their
<hi rend="italic">fixed property</hi> in town-house, or metropolitan villa ? Environed by a host like this, the magnates of the land need not dread the attacks of thieves, <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>, or on <hi rend="italic">the road</hi>; even though the high walls and deep areas of the mansion; the secure windows, gaol-like railings, and well-pannelled doors, guarded within by a peeping <hi rend="italic"><persName key="Cerberus">Cerberus</persName></hi>, by day, and watched without by a sleepy <hi rend="italic"><persName key="Charles">Charles</persName></hi>, at night, did not laugh to scorn the Quixotic attempts of every marauder, however daring; whilst the rapidity of their equipages, when journeying, set at nought the

And these are neither few nor far between; nor exclude a near (very near) view and taste of the <quote>varieties of life ;</quote> for our high-born gentry of the present day, have wisely cast aside the stiff manners and poker-back gait of the former age, and descended to personal investigation of the condition and means of living among the lower orders, and a little more:-* * *. Thanks be to all <soCalled>"the saints"</soCalled> for this familiar intercourse, and its consequence, a due appreciation of the bents and inclinations, and amusements, and morality of the lower orders, which had been grossly misrepresented by <hi rend="italic">the elect</hi> and the super-humane in <quote>the houses</quote> as well as <quote>out of doors,</quote> and even in the streets.</p>
  <p>On the contrary, isolated persons, on their first visit to town, to whom the loss of their little property is of great moment, if not ruin, lie most exposed to depredations of every kind, by being obliged to assort, during their sojournment with every description of characters, who look upon <hi rend="italic">the countryman</hi> as fair game, and act accordingly as they may belong to the bad, good, or indifferent particles of society. The worst of these usually take advantage of the countenance they receive from the better disposed, and <hi rend="italic">the game</hi> they make consists not in words alone: if they do not commit any direct

 <note type="header" place="head">ANXIETY OF STRANGERS, WORKED UPON.</note> depredation on the stranger, no means of doing this seems readier than to <hi rend="italic">put up</hi> some of their acquaintance to the most easy and safe manner of performing the same piece of disservice. On his part, the stranger endeavours to avoid the company of suspected persons, expresses a feverish anxiety to ascertain the true mode of discriminating the honest from the roguish part of mankind, and sometimes so bewilders himself with surmises, that he falls an easier prey in consequence; for the deluding rogues then operate upon his fears, with exaggerated statements, false intelligence, and recommendations of deceitful security, adding hereto insidious advice, and counselling him to his destruction; all these are accompanied with the usual overstrained professions of friendship, honour, and disinterestedness, including offers of assistance, that turn out like the broken staff, and schemes of money-making, that are never realised. Most of these latter remarks apply to those visitors who come to London occasionally to vend their goods, whether manufactures or produce of the land: such people may be said to be always <hi rend="italic">green</hi> for, what they learn, at one such visit, they forget by the next; else the rogues devise new schemes to meet new emergencies, or the people our stranger has met, from year to year, may have fallen in the scale of opulence, of credit and of honesty, have entirely lost their caste in society, and become roguish through necessity. This is not meant

<p>THE <hi rend="italic">fresh arrivals</hi> in town by <hi rend="italic">water</hi>, although the intercourse with every part by this method has greatly increased of late, are much less than a sight of the hourly bustle of disembarkation, from steamers, and sailing vessels, and Gravesend boats, and coasters, would induce the casual observer to imagine. Neither do the strangers, who adopt this mode of reaching London, subject their property to that reckless species of depredation, which environs the less temerarious <hi rend="italic">land traveller</hi>, and pursues him from the moment of his arrival in the surburbs, until he reach his <hi rend="italic">resting place</hi>, nor even then quits him entirely.

Yet do watermen, porters, and hackneymen, plead in extenuation of their exactions, with some degree of reason, both precedent and example in every other trade and calling; they of the boats and wherries asserting, that the sousing overboard of their <hi rend="italic">fares</hi>, and the loss of life that occasionally ensues their squabbles for customers, is not more disagreeable and destructive than the <hi rend="italic">practice of medicine</hi> and its attendant consequences.</p>
  <p>Much of the evil here complained of has been lately abated, but much remains to be done, and to be guarded against; yet nothing can be effectually achieved until <hi rend="italic">the steamers</hi> run along the quay side and discharge their passengers over their bows and sterns, as practised by the Gravesend boats and others.

So is any purloining at the Tower-stairs and at <placeName key="Billingsgate"> Billingsgate</placeName> astonishingly infrequent, notwithstanding the lots of queer, jumbo-looking characters that always hang about the latter, and often show a nose at the former.

 <note type="header" place="head">LUGGAGE EXPOSED, AND PASSENGERS CAJOLED-CASE IN POINT.</note>
   <p><hi rend="italic">Inn Yards</hi>, where coaches put up, and set down their passengers, on the contrary, are scenes of greatly variegated villainy. Smashing, robbery of parcels, some of exceeding great value, the cajoling of passengers into scrapes with game hackneymen, and other projects are still resorted to, and formerly was more extensively employed by the caddee, coachy, hanger-on, and more distinctly marked thief. If the travellers would be set down as they pass along, at some spot more conveniently situate near their friends' address, they had need look well after their luggage, and not only see that the whole is taken from the stage, but placed in the hackney-coach that is to carry them the remaining distance. Thieves of the most expert sort are always sneaking about at every such place, and those of the most finished education and gallant spirit attend the
<hi rend="italic">coming in</hi> of stage-coaches, mails, and even waggons, at the White-horse-Cellar, Elephant and Castle, Basing-house, and such like places of last stoppage, in and out. Indeed, the little public houses generally on the outskirts of town, and always one or two near the places just named, as well as along shore, are frequented by a very ordinary and desperate set; all of whom are constantly upon the sharp <hi rend="italic">look out</hi>, seeking.whom they may cheat, if they cannot rob; the innocent, the artless, and the unwary, are alike their prey, whom they seek to rob, to cajole into <hi rend="italic">play</hi>, or to the purchase goods, deceit-

It would seem, that the very sight of a <hi rend="italic">countryman</hi>, either youkel or joskin, adds sharpness to their appetite for plunder, especially if he brings his wife with him, because she must necessarily embarrass his operations; a single thief will watch the movements of such a pair for hours together, or through an entire day; and I have known two go upon the same scent, though unknown to each other, and when an explanation took place they joined, cordially, in hunting down their prey, agreeing to divide the booty; he who obtained what he now calls <quote>the swagg,</quote> paying to his new pal an undefined share, which the thieves persist in calling their

  <p><hi rend="italic">Coachmen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">guards</hi>, when setting down their fares in the streets, as before alluded to, often appear to me as if they, too, would pander to the designs of prowling thieves, by the utter carelessness with which they leave the luggage exposed to the wide world on some such occasions. <q type="spoken">"Let them, and all such scaly rips, take care of their own things,"</q> replied one of those coachmen to me, upon my remonstra-

The party thus came up to town with a good character at their tails, which, doubtless, accompanied them to the house of their sojournment, and plagued them during every hour of it; for the hackneyman, who was, hereupon, called off the stand to

           <note type="header" place="head">COACHMAN SUSPECTED.</note> did not quite merit the disadvantageous opinion which I had formed of him, and certainly entertained of his character for the space (as I have said) of two hours; for I had followed him to his inn, and place of <hi rend="italic">putting-up</hi>, and eyed him over, and touted his goings on for a long time before I <hi rend="italic">opened</hi> upon him, as above. But in the next degree to the crime of pandering to the designs of prowlers, this coachman certainly did <hi rend="italic">favour</hi> the attempt, and knew that he was throwing a booty in their way. Had those well-known thieves effected their intentions-and I almost lament my stagging them-this very coachman might possibly (I thought) have been found at their haunt in the evening, taking a quiet glass of ale at the bar, with the real intention of applying for his share of the booty-or <hi rend="italic">regulars</hi>.

Do we not see the Crowther, the Ally Sanders, the Tom Clarke, just in the same state as when that rig first began? Then again, why was not a description published of the persons of the more than suspected passengers per the robbed mails? However, on these subjects I shall dilate in the sequel. As a set-off for this potent argument as to the unchanged condition of the suspected persons, we may adduce that of a most flourishing coachproprietor of the present day, whom we recollect, a few years since, a buyer of any goods from any body, not void of of-<hi rend="italic">fence</hi>! in <placeName key="White Cross-street">White Cross-street</placeName>; but do not mean to infer that

  <p>But we shall come to speak more of those characters-the conductors of our coaches, a few pages further down, and of another great proprietor, who formerly <hi rend="italic">drove</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shouldered</hi> with the proprietors, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> employers of a former

  <p><hi rend="italic">Smashing</hi> is the first depredation to which strangers are exposed upon <hi rend="italic">setting foot</hi> in London, and consists in passing bad money, or pretending that you yourself have paid base coin to <hi rend="italic">the smasher</hi>, who unblushingly insists upon your exchanging his base stuff for good money. The practice is not so rife these latter years as before the issue of the present coinage, but an inundation of false pieces, at times, occasions the evil to break out afresh most extensively, and we then hear of deluded poor persons detected in passing false half crowns, shillings, and sixpences, who suffer the law, without the chance of escape. But the reproach that the original offenders, coiners and <hi rend="italic">putters forth</hi> by wholesale, elude punishment no longer holds good, since the detection and execution of the family of <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> coiners, the branch at <placeName key="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</placeName>, one very substantial manufacturer at <placeName key="Birmingham">Birmingham</placeName>, and other minor scions of the destructive deceit elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Without particularising any one description of characters at the inns, who would be more likely than another to practise this particular species of cheatery, I shall be justified in saying <hi rend="italic">they are all liable</hi>-coachmen, guards, clerks, and waiters, to be themselves imposed upon; and although not guilty, are, neverthe-

The original evil of its introduction to the yards arises with certain fellows, who always hover about, assuming to be extremely <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> to the proprietors, in procuring them customers from other inns, for which service they demand a shilling, or two shillings, according to the value of the fare they <hi rend="italic">bring</hi>. They acquire the name of <hi rend="italic">caddees</hi> from all the people of the yard, when spoken of
<hi rend="italic">behind their backs</hi>, with some such feeling as ministers of state speak of spies, deserters, and informers to the life.

According to the phrase, nothing seems to be too hot or too heavy for them.</p>
  <p>Indeed, the great number and variety of depredators about those inns, would lead the casual observer to conclude, that rogues of every  species had  gathered  together, and were tolerated to despoil him of his property. On this topic, an indignant writer, of the last age, thus strongly commences his satire.-

The usual plan is, when the passengers' things lie about confusedly, some waiting to be taken into the booking-office, some making way towards the tavern, others for a hackney-coach, and one or two not knowing whither they would go, nor making inquiry for a place of shelter from sun or snow, from wind and rain, until they find none in company but themselves and the sharpers; then the latter become officious, offering their services, either of information or help.

<hi rend="italic">at</hi> some one, if he do not bawl aloud, as if announcing his <quote>coming, coming,</quote> or giving a command, as <quote>Fakenham, Faken-ham, Buckenham, here, in half an hour, I tell ye.

How many score times has he not stood at the end of some avenue, or corner of the gateway, to catch hold, with an energetic adroitness only known to <hi rend="italic">street-business</hi>, of whatever might be dropped from the coach-tail, with a view to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the coach-proprietors, the <hi rend="italic">revenue</hi>, the right owners, or, with less guilt, the game squirearchy ?

But the particular anecdote, which superinduced that charge against the <hi rend="italic">conductors of coaches</hi>, may as well be told, as matter of historical illustration: it does not stand alone, and should the present administration make room for the old bigotry in commercial polity to return, as seems not at all impossible, then may trade receive anew its old prohibitory shackles, and smuggling recommence with ruinous vigour, to the discomfiture of <placeName key="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</placeName>,

        <note type="header" place="head">CASE OF SMUGGLING.</note> and starvation of <placeName key="Macclesfield">Macclesfield</placeName> and other localities.</p>
  <p>In the year <date value="1815">1815</date>, the <placeName key="Glasgow">Glasgow</placeName> coach brought up one hundred and twenty pieces of <placeName key="India">India</placeName> handkerchiefs, weekly, forty in a bundle,

No one could imagine how such an article could come from that quarter; nor is it our present business or inclination to inquire; but apprehend, that a very large lot had been sent thither, coastwise, from London. This fun lasted some time; and I thought it pleasant to see <soCalled>"the hanger-on"</soCalled> of the coach-conductor scamper away with the square bundle, of a morning, usually from the corner of Little Britain, but not always depositing the load at the same place. What is more (as matter of history, still) I bought a bundle of these from
<persName key="Thomas,Thomas">Thomas Thomas</persName>, the agent, whom his friends dubbed " knight of the long stomach," from his gastronomic properties; but I never saw the principal person, and the price paid was a little more than two pounds the piece. Under existing circumstances, great precautions seemed necessary, but whether as to my cheque for the amount, or my fidelity in another respect, is uncertain; but they compelled me to stop dinner, amidst a <hi rend="italic">pell-mellish</hi> set, at one Sukey's, a widow woman, apparently, until all the goods then in the dining-room had changed

  <p>From all this exposure, the reader must be aware, that persons so employed are not trustworthy with his luggage, and that he would do well to see after it with his own eyes; for, if he permit one of those officious <hi rend="italic">hangers-on</hi> to meddle with it, no opportunity will slip by unimproved, though the coachman and guard stand near him the while. These men are not checks sufficiently strong upon the rogue, since he is himself <hi rend="italic">down</hi> to so many of their tricks, such as <quote>shouldering,</quote> and <hi rend="italic">smashing</hi>, and " ringing the changes," that they dare not interfere.</p>
  <p><hi rend="italic">Shouldering</hi>, among coachmen and guards, is that species of cheating their employers in which they take the <hi rend="italic">fares</hi> and pocket them, generally of such passengers as they overtake on the road, or who come across the country to the main road, and are not put down in the <hi rend="italic">way-bill</hi>; but it not unfrequently happens, that they take passengers throughout the whole line of their route, even when the proprietors have scarcely one inside for themselves, to pay for horsekeep, turnpikes, and wear and tear of coaches. Some years since, a disappointed old character frequently amused the lookers-on at Lad-lane, by charging a certain <hi rend="italic">great man</hi> there, with shouldering to a great excess, stating particularly one instance when they were together,

 may as well be told, that whoever vaunts his honesty over-much is ill to be entrusted with property; neither is that cockney a man of sterling ability who constantly brings all his parts into play, as we too often notice, in all the concerns of <hi rend="italic">Town Life</hi>; the desire to appear <quote>chief muck of the crib,</quote> pervades all classes, from the stable door to the bench and pictured room, over which Gog and Magog stand sentry. So, whichever among the <hi rend="italic">hangers on</hi> is the most talkative, garrulous, or impudent, is ever the least honest; hard, evil, and flippant words, being meant to cover correspondent bad acts: the same remark applies forcibly to all employed persons, <hi rend="italic">indoors</hi> as well as out, great and small, rich and poor, individually, or in the great <hi rend="italic">public assemblies</hi>.</p>
  <p>Complaints against the <hi rend="italic">conductors</hi> of stagecoaches, to be just, should divide them into two or more classes, one of which stands aloof from any imputation of dishonesty-if all might not originally so stand, until accident or a wrong course of evil ways render the second set more than suspect.

  <note type="header" place="head">POACHING.-DEGRADED COACHMEN.</note> owner is at hand, much too readily. And every moralist knows, that the feelings once blunted by any illegal pursuit, or degrading occupation, leaves their owner open to the fascinations or the dishonour of another species of villany, and then another, until, at length, the quality of the crime is no longer an object of consideration, or its extent cause of solicitude, unless it be for the means of concealment.  <hi rend="italic">Poaching</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">the sale</hi> of game, for example, though, in itself, no more a crime than breathing the fresh air, or dealing in game cocks, or any other provender, nevertheless, infuses into the mind a notion of transgressing a highly penal statute, and leaves an impress on the <hi rend="italic">perpetrator</hi> of his having deserved ill of his fellow men, whom he shuns <hi rend="italic">by day,</hi> lest their prying eyes review every action of his life too scrupulously even for perfect man to bear, to say nothing of the contaminated and self-accusing.

Ten pounds were paid him, with thanks; and I had the curiosity, according to my fashion, to bestow an hour on ascertaining how he would behave upon the occasion towards a crowd of coachmen there assembled, as is usual. His conduct was that of a stoic: he regained his chair, took his grog charily, and the fact of this payment, which had transpired at the bar, would have remained unknown to the company probably, but for another <hi rend="italic">treasure-trove</hi> circumstance, though perfectly dissimilar, that had recently occurred on the <placeName key="Northern road">Northern road</placeName>.</p>

Hence, the observer is justified in concluding that whatever coachman <hi rend="italic">manoeuvres</hi> his coachdoor is at <hi rend="italic">no good</hi>; the hackneyman, on discharging his <hi rend="italic">fare</hi>, keeps open his door to prevent his number from being seen; whilst the stage- coachman keeps his door tight against his back, the better to conceal what he is at.

   <note type="header" place="head">DETECTION OF GAME COACHMEN AND WATERMEN: THEIR MANNER.</note>

  <p>Persons who may at any time be <hi rend="italic">down</hi> to what is passing on such occasions may place themselves in a condition to reveal the fact to the right owner, by making a memorandum of the number of the coach--its destination, colour, hour of occurrence, or other particulars, and communicating the same the next days, provided the owner should advertise or apply at the Hackney-coach-office.  This may be considered as <hi rend="italic">nosing</hi>, by the rogues; but what man of strong mind cares for such fellows or their slangery when a benefit is to be conferred ?</p>
  <p>Every one knows (and their employers feel the truth of it) that hackney-coachmen invariably share with their masters in large proportions. Those often find good prizes in their coaches, by people carelessly leaving their boxes or parcels behind, in the hurry to meet their friends; or, what is more general, those who take out their papers, money, pocket-book,
&amp;c. to look over in a hackney-coach, in order, as they think, to save time, too often leave some part behind them; or else, by the motion of the coach, these get jostled out of their hands, or off the seats. At no time has a hackneyman been known to restore to its rightful owner such things as may have been so left,
'at the earliest opportunity,' nor at all voluntarily, unless a <hi rend="italic">handsome</hi> reward is offered.</p>
  <p>By the way, the number of a hackney-coach should be always noted the moment it is <hi rend="italic">called</hi>
(or <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi>); and in so <quote>calling</quote> them, as

<pb id="p.43" n="43"/> well as every word that is said to the coachman, a certain air of command or authority should be kept up. This holds them to their tethers; tells them they have no green-horn to deal with, and deters them from extorting too much for the fare. If a person, kindly or hesitatingly, gives his orders, the coachman and attendant-
<hi rend="italic">waterman</hi> pass the word <soCalled>"<hi rend="italic">Johnny Raw</hi>,"</soCalled> with a wink of the eye; or, if it be a lady, they protract the sound of <q type="spoken">" Ma'am"</q> to her;--thus,
<q type="spoken">"yes, M-a-a-m,"</q> and <q type="spoken">"no, M-a-a-r-m."</q></p>
  <p>When a coach is called from the stand, the
<hi rend="italic">waterman</hi> opens the door as it draws near you, in order to prevent the number, which hangs on it, from obtruding itself on your notice: at
<hi rend="italic">setting down</hi>, the coachman, with the same view, keeps open the door whilst he gets paid, especially if there be a dispute; but, if he
<hi rend="italic">twigs</hi> something left behind, he bangs the steps or the door, so as to make the horses move on a step or two; he then halloos at them with who-o-o; swears a good peal of oaths at them, to intimidate his customers, and then resumes the dispute, if convenient.</p>
   <p>If a hackney-coachman be a smasher, or dealer in bad silver, he endeavours to set down his fares (by night) in a dark place, if possible, in total disregard of your orders, and generally quarrels with his horses, should he be obliged to take them by the heads,-which quarrel is sometimes meant to be addressed to his customers.

<q type="spoken">" you'll soon be <hi rend="italic">bowled out</hi>, I'll pound it."</q> Such is a fair sample of the conduct of the far greater number of hackney-coachmen; whilst some have been known sadly to maltreat their fares, women as well as men, driving them about from place to place, in order to run up a large demand; though it must be allowed that they themselves often <hi rend="italic">get done</hi> out of their just demands, by drunken, foolish, or mad persons, who know not whither to drive, nor what they are driving at. The <hi rend="cl">SMASHING</hi> part of the affair the hackneyman manages somewhat after this form-a bad shilling or two, or a halfcrown, is placed in the left hand between the fingers, or first finger and thumb, and the hand closed upon them: he has taken them from his pocket, and the operation is performed while he tries hard at the coach-door to let you out, or lets down the glass. Should <quote>the fare</quote> want change for a sovereign, the result is no longer
<pb id="p.45" n="45"/> doubtful: three or four shillings, <hi rend="italic">at least</hi>, <soCalled>"come to his share."</soCalled>  But the chiefest ingenuity is, to persuade you that you yourself have tendered bad money to poor <persName key="Jarvis">Jarvis</persName>; who, after turning your money over and over, and perhaps taking a trial upon the stones, declares they <hi rend="italics">ring bad</hi>, and you must change them for good ones.

<p>Properly, as a means of avoiding molestation, and to be performed pleasantly, is an acquisition of no small importance. It is effected most securely by affecting an ease or knowingness, which deters imposition in a great degree. I spoke higher up of assuming an air of authority in giving orders to hackney-coachmen; no less serviceable is it to <hi rend="italics">appear</hi> like a thoroughbred cockney in your gait and manner; perhaps by placing the hat a little awry, and with an unconcerned stare, penetrating the wily countenances of the rogues, you attain one more chance, at least, of escaping the snares that are always laid to entrap the countryman or new comer. These latter are easily recognized by their provincial gait, dialect, and cut of their clothes; by the interest they take in the commonest occurrences imaginable, and a broad stare of astonishment at every thing they chance to see. All these peculiarities attract attention, and raises the cupidity of the dishonest, who soon proceed to action nefariously. Such men

He is followed for miles, sometimes for an entire day, or more, by a string of pickpockets or highway robbers, until they can find an opportunity to do him. It came out on the examination of <persName key="Sethard">Sethard</persName>, for robbing <persName key="Anderson,A.">A.

  <p><hi rend="italics">Walking the streets</hi> has been reduced to a system in London; every one taking the right hand of another, whereby confusion is avoided;

 <note type="header" place="head">SYSTEM OF WALKING THE STREETS: SHAKING OFF A QUEER CUSTOMER.</note> thus, if you walk from <placeName key="St. Paul's corner">St. Paul's corner</placeName>, by
<placeName key="Bow-church">Bow-church</placeName>, towards the <placeName key="Royal Exchange">Royal Exchange</placeName>, you will be entitled to take the wall of those you <hi rend="italics">meet</hi>, all the way; whereas, if you cross over to the <placeName key="Newgate-street">Newgate-street</placeName> side you must walk upon the kirb-stone. The contrary mode is a sure indication of a person being a stranger, or living at the outskirts of town, and is certain of attracting attention to his awkwardness, a thing always to be avoided. A pickpocket will hustle such an one against his accomplice in the day-time; the stranger will be irritated no doubt, and express his indignation, which will be the better for the rogues: in a half-minute's altercation, they get the best of the jaw, because the loudest and most impudent;-a <hi rend="italics">sparring</hi> ensues, in which he who pretends to support the stranger to the ways of town, draws him of his pocket-book, or his watch, if he has either, a fact they take care to ascertain beforehand. <hi rend="italics">Money</hi> in the <hi rend="italics">breeches</hi>-pockets can only be come at in a crowd, or by <hi rend="italics">flooring</hi> the victim; the former of which is most usually, but the latter very seldom, performed in the daytime. A  good preventive against this drawing the loose money from a pocket, in the day-time especially, is to carry something <hi rend="italics">stiff</hi> upon it, as a pair of spectacles, a short memorandum-book, or the like; of either of which the present capaciousness of breeches-pockets admit most conveniently. When, however, the thief has opportunity, he carries off these

<pb id="p.49" n="49"/>
 latter also, after  repeated visits to the pockets.</p>
  <p>From all this, the reader will see the necessity of cautiously, yet energetically, pursuing his way, without dread or doubt; since it is better to walk a little out of the right path, than run the risk of being <hi rend="italics">directed</hi> wrong: to steer clear of assemblages in the streets, by going round them, or in default, pressing rather
<hi rend="italics">rudely</hi> through them, staring the most forward steadily in the face; whereby you become the
<hi rend="italics">assailant</hi>, if I may be allowed the term, and add one more chance of steering clear of danger, by a bold measure. Out of this practice of <hi rend="italics">taking the right</hi> of all you meet, arises a good practical manoeuvre, which may be played off upon any hanger-on who would wish to walk cheek-by-jowl with you through the streets. He may be shook off by your walking briskly, so as the current of people may flow against him, as well as by your cutting sharply by them as they come on in succession; the intruder is thus left behind wherever the pavement may be crowded, particularly if you meet the current and take the kirb-stone. Jew pedlars, and other itinerant venders of their wares, are also thus easily tired of the

  <p>Notwithstanding police-officers constantly patrol the streets, or ought to do so, yet they suffer well-known thieves to mix in the crowds that assemble around print-shops, and other showy exhibitions of goods. If a horse tumbles, or a woman faints, away they run, to increase the crowd and the confusion; they create a bustle, and try over the pockets of unsuspecting persons; till, at length, having marked out one, the accomplice shoves him hard up against other persons, (usually some of the gang,) who naturally repress the intrusion. Thus wedged in, they next hit him on the head with a stick, when he, to save his hat, or to resent the insult, lifts up his arms; a third or a fourth, still farther behind, gives one more shove, rams his flat hand hard against the belly of the person marked out to be <hi rend="italics">done</hi>, and pulls out his watch. If it be his pocket-book they are <hi rend="italics">after</hi>, they lift up the skirts of his coat, to come at his inside pocket, but, should it lie on his breast, then the rogue, who is next to the victim, seizes his collar behind, and drags until the buttons give way or there is space enough between the coat and the body for the accomplice to thrust in his arm.</p>
  <p>So situated, it is clear that every other pocket must be liable to a visit, the breeches not excepted. As he in the rear is generally a
<hi rend="italics">short</hi> man, or a boy, he thrusts in underneath the arms of the accomplices, who make room

On that day the gangs assemble regularly, and enter the city at various points. For many years the practice has been to station two women of good stout growth near the place of operation, who receive the few stray articles that may be picked up before the grand rush is made, when they join in, and increase the confusion. Some ten or twelve men, mostly carrying sticks, are attached to these women, and act in concert on one side of the hill, while a gang similarly composed take the other side, and numerous smaller detachments, and single independeht rogues, are strewed about in all directions.</p>
  <p>As the procession advances, the main object is, of course, to create a bustle, and, if possible, a bit of a fight.  They, therefore, enclose between them a few people of respectable appearance, and press them forward rudely; those in front resent this, pretending to be offended, and thrust back those next to them; the sticks <hi rend="italics">go to work</hi> upon the heads, and the

But things of this nature change in a course of years, for the very circumstance of this present exposure must, of necessity, compel alteration, to prevent detection. Yet again, on consideration, this is not so certain, since, upon some occasions, there are not a greater set of fools in the world than your hackneyed thieves: they have been known to throw themselves in the way of certain detection, or to stand, like the silly penguin, to be knocked down, when, at the same time, a good run for it would have preserved them in safety.</p>
  <p>Should a street thief take to his heels, and be easily distinguished from his followers, it is not always advisable to <hi rend="italics">stop</hi> him; unless, indeed, you are fond of a bit of a <hi rend="italics">spree</hi>, or admire being in trouble, as is exemplified in <persName key="Bee">Mr. Bee</persName>'s adventure, alluded to in <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, for June, <date value="1817">1817</date>, page 309, signed

   <hi rend="italics">Strangers</hi> and silly persons, who are the chief objects with the pickpockets, are not better known by their first appearance than from the ill-advised custom  of <hi rend="italics">asking the way</hi> of stragglers, and standing gaping at the <hi rend="italics">names</hi> of the streets, as if in doubt which road to take. This being a sure indication that he is at a loss, and of course confused, such a person is, perhaps, accosted, and misdirected into some street or lane more adapted to the robbers' purpose; and being there met again, or overtake, by one, two, or three others, he is either <hi rend="italics">hustled</hi>, or his <hi rend="italics">pockets neatly picked</hi>, or, if it be night,
<hi rend="italics">knocked down</hi> with a bludgeon. Therefore, it is recommendable that no one should ask his way in the streets, but in decent shops, or, at most, of persons carrying small parcels, which indicate they are shopmen or porters: thieves do not go about encumbered in that manner, at least not hitherto, but they might possibly. adopt it hereafter, from this hint, as the best method of <hi rend="italics">catching flats</hi>. Never ask your road of a gentleman in appearance: if he be a real one, he either will not condescend to answer, or, more probably, does not know any more than yourself; and for a better reason-that thieves frequently go well-dressed, especially pickpockets; good <hi rend="italics">toggery</hi> being considered a necessary qualification for his calling, without which the <hi rend="italics">diver</hi> could not possibly mix in genteel company, nor approach such in the streets.</p>

<hi rend="italics">right road</hi> to his place of destination is occasioned by the course of instruction he has received as to the means of finding it as much as to the manner; for example, our stranger being in <placeName key="St. Paul's-Church-yard">St. Paul's-Church-yard</placeName> would fain inquire his way to <placeName key="Temple-bar">Temple-bar</placeName>, let us suppose. He has taken the precaution to ask at <hi rend="italics">a shop</hi>, we allow, or the joke would be none, and there receives for answer, from a <hi rend="italics">good-looking</hi> sort of man, that <q type="spoken">"he must go round <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName></hi>, down <placeName key="Ludgate-street"><hi rend="italics">Ludgate-street</hi></placeName>, and through <placeName key="Fleet-street"><hi rend="italics">Fleet-street</hi></placeName>,"</q> which is all <hi rend="italics">quite correct</hi>, but, at the same time, very puzzling, for he is thus put upon gaping about at the corners of streets for all those
<hi rend="italics">names</hi>, or asking over again: whereas, he ought to have been told to <q type="spoken">"go round the corner and keep strait onward until he came to an archway, "<hi rend="italics">which is the Bar</hi>."</q> Some thorough-bred cockneys laugh outright at any one who should inquire for so obvious a point as <hi rend="italics">Temple-bar</hi>; and I recollect, when a youth, receiving the pity of two or three shopmen in <placeName key="Marybonestreet">Marybonestreet</placeName>

  <p>The close observer may always discover in the dress of the genteel pickpocket some want of unity, or shabby article, as a rusty hat, or the boot-tops in bad order, or a dirty shirt and cravat, He may come at the same conclusion by noticing an article of the fellow's dress, which has been made at the top of the mode, some long while before the other parts of his clothes, together with similar attempts to appear the would-be gentleman of <hi rend="italics">ton</hi>. Mr. Pullen was, however, an exception to this general rule: the neatness and uniformity of his rigging, from top to toe, his cleanliness, the mild smirk of his red face, and at length, his age, contributed to render him as truly respectable looking a pickpocket as we shall ever find again. A curious proof how far this feeling regarding <persName key="Pullen">Mr. Pullen</persName> was carried will be learnt from the following anecdote.</p>
  <p><persName key="Pullen">Mr. Pullen</persName> found occasion to go into a public house at some part of town distant from his usual haunts.

What is more, they handed him along, arm-in-arm, between them, and he could scarcely get liberty to speak a word to a nice, crummy young woman, who seemed surprised and interested at his situation. <q type="spoken">"He wished to send home a message by her,"</q> he said; but the two boobies would not <hi rend="italics">lose sight</hi> of him, and did but just loosen their hold for the purpose.

His intention is not to use violence, and he even avoids being <hi rend="italics">felt</hi> at work, for which reason the law has made it <hi rend="italics">capital</hi> felony to execute his task so adroitly as not to be discovered <hi rend="italics">in the act of taking</hi>; notwithstanding which law, he always endeavours to incur the highest crime, while the judge as invariably apportions to him the lesser punishment.</p>
  <p>For the accomplishment of his purpose, he walks the crowded streets, and tries the pockets of various passers by; till, at length, he finds the situation of the <hi rend="italics">pocket-book</hi>,-which has been the favourite aim ever since the extensive circulation of Bank-notes. If it occupies the outer coat-pocket, the task is easy: he dips his hand into the pocket, spreading his fingers to keep open the top, and with the forefinger and thumb draws it forth. Sometimes, out it comes easily, which will be the case if

    <note type="header" place="head">LIVERY OF STREET THIEVES.</note> not near so large as the pocket; but should it stick, or hang by something else, the rogue
<hi rend="italics">stands no repairs</hi>, but pulls away by main force.</p>
  <p>During the first part of the operation, and previously, he has walked a step or two cheekby-jowl with the person to be robbed; he looks about, smiling, to take off the attention of those who may be near behind, as if they were acquaintance, and the thing a mere matter of course and familiarity. A thin worn-out greatcoat, flowing open, is an excellent screen to hide the operations that may be carrying on within its folds; and shabby pick- pockets cannot be better known, generally speaking, than by this sort of half-genteel, worn-out frock coat, that twines and twists about the legs of every man they meet, and thus imparts the dirt with which it may be charged. But fashions change, even whilst we write: the dandy-cut coat will soon vanish. A lower order of pickpockets, hustlers, and street-pads, have long been known by the blue-coat and trousers with gilt buttons, that were so general among them, it seemed the livery of their <hi rend="italics">caste.</hi> Blue is a favourite colour with vulgar fellows of every grade; but became general with this class upon the robbery of a warehouse, at the corner of <placeName key="Sambrook-court">Sambrook-court</placeName>, <placeName key="Basinghall-street">Basinghall-street</placeName>, several years ago, when the whole stock was stolen, and <hi rend="italics">the blues</hi> got into the hands

        <note type="header" place="head">MODE OF DRAWING BY TWO,</note> of pickpockets is that they wear no gloves, possession of one being the highest aim they take in this supernecessary article of dress.</p>
  <p>If the article to be <hi rend="italics">drawn</hi> is heavy, and its weight might be instantly missed by the bearer, the thief presses equally hard upon the edge of the pocket, or stoops a little to take hold of the bottom, gives a jirk, steps upon the heel, or jostles against the person <hi rend="italics">done</hi>; then seems to beg pardon, and runs. For the inside skirt coat-pocket, he lifts up the skirt or tail, and out comes the pocket-book. Should a button impede the way out, a little knife fastened to the hand, soon removes that obstacle. Therefore, mark, reader ! whenever you are jostled against, or your heel is trodden upon, you may
<hi rend="italics">suspect</hi> that person, and consider him who is nearest to you on the other side as having already robbed you.</p>
  <p>Two are much safer to get off than one, as the second keeps a good look-out, or walking behind, covers the operation from being touted, and he it is that goes off with the prize, having received it from him who first took it. This one, being next to the victim, if seized, as is most likely, kicks up a row, and uses the most disgusting language; or, in quite other tones, offers to pursue him who has gone off; but, in fact, in pursuing, throws obstacles in the way of others; for, should he come up with, and overtake him in the hands of justice, they together fight away, if possible, to effect an escape;

   <p>Many women are as expert as men, and these always have one or two of them at hand, upon great occasions, as I said before. They are furnished with a species of pocket, which completely encircles their bodies, coming down half way to the knees; if the wearer be somewhat stout and bulky, it is clear she can conceal a good deal. Besides, if she be searched upon suspicion, the articles will traverse from before to behind, and back again, with a very small quantity of dextrousness; and she would thus elude discovery by any <hi rend="italics">ordinary</hi> scrutiny of her person. The same sort of pocket is used in <hi rend="italics">shop-lifting</hi>,-which see.</p>
  <p>Women who <hi rend="italics">walk the streets</hi> at night are invariably pickpockets; and I see no reason to set down those who by day entice the men into their dens, as any thing better. An intolerable nuisance long prevailed of harlots sitting by day at their windows, and inviting the unwary to their salacious embraces. Punishment now awaits the practice, and we rejoice to say it has been abated. Modest females, their parents and guardians, will hence perceive the extreme danger of indulging the whim of staring at impudent men passengers, who do not hesitate to speak occasionally to females they never saw before. Such as stand at the

<pb id="p.65" n="65"/> corners of lanes and courts, inviting men to stop, are clumsy hands, but contrive to pick up a good harvest occasionally: they rob indiscriminately every article of dress, knocking off the silly (perhaps drunken) man's hat in the street, with which the accomplice runs away; at other times they will take off his cravat, while bestowing upon him their salacious caresses. A brooch, or shirt-pin, is constantly made good prize of, but should the deluded man enter one of those pestiferous abodes, which are so numerous in this metropolis, the loss of all he has is inevitable.</p>
  <p>It is recommended over again not to suffer yourself to be stopped in the streets, even by a <hi rend="italics">handsome</hi> woman, though that should be by day. They have great nimbleness of fingers, and convey away your property while talking you into a silly passion for their persons.</p>
  <p>Although it seems brutish to rebuke a woman who should press against you in a crowd, in a church, at an auction, or in the streets, yet this should be done. At the <persName key="Hill,Rowland">Rev. Rowland Hill</persName>'s meeting-house, for example, the women attend as well as the men pickpockets; they are found amongst the crowd of a procession to <placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName>, at every lord mayor's show, and in fact at every collection of people. Such women amuse you with asking silly questions; perhaps, she will complain to you of some man who is pressing her behind, while one of her accomplices rifles your pockets in the mean time, from

<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>

  <note type="header" place="head"> WOMEN USE FORCE: PROCESS OF ROBBERY.</note> behind another accomplice, who keeps his arms up so as to prevent yours from defending your property. Perhaps she seizes your arm, as if for protection, but in fact, to keep you from using it. Aye, she seizes both arms if that be deemed necessary, with the strength of manhood.</p>
   <p>One very <hi rend="italics">excellent</hi> trick for a woman to perform is to turn round quick upon the gentleman to be robbed, and running hard against him, endeavour to touch him in the wind, pretending herself to be very much hurt. Her accomplices are behind, and improve upon the
<hi rend="italics">accident</hi> by embracing the victim ; and the hindermost is generally the thief, who hands off the property. It must be present to every one's mind, that when a person is hit upon the belly, or pit of the stomach--and those women are taught how to place their blows-he will naturally bend from the effects of the blow: at that moment it is he loses his watch, a <hi rend="italics">dive</hi> is made into his breeches-pocket, and both are drawn; and if the lady's hurt is very bad, (that is, well <hi rend="italics">played off</hi>,) his pocket-book goes to wreck also.</p>
  <p>This same trick of turning round is also practised by two or three men; and a <hi rend="italics">good</hi> method was for one of them to stoop suddenly down, whereby the person to be robbed comes wholly, or in part, to the ground; then, during the struggle to recover himself, or the efforts of the accomplice to <hi rend="italics">assist</hi> him insidiously, the job is usually effected undetected.

<note type="header" place="head">SHOP WINDOWS: CUTTING INSTRUMENT.</note>
  <p>Ladies who press to the windows of drapers' shops are fine game. When they wore pockets with hoops, scarcely any operation in all the light fingered trade was easier than the dive, or putting in one's hand; afterwards on the disuse of the hoop, the thing was performed by a short fellow, or boy, getting between the legs of the accomplice (a tall one) and spreading the petticoats, cut off the pockets, with a knife attached to the hand.</p>
  <p>The practice of <hi rend="italics">cutting</hi> pockets is much lessened of late years,why, I know not for certain; but apprehend the fear of incurring the penalty of <persName key="Ellenborough">Lord Ellenborough</persName>'s act, by cutting too deep, may have had its effect; and since there are several methods of achieving the same thing, there could be no possible reason why the safest should not be adopted. Any other course of proceeding would be foolish, to say no worse of it. A high-tempered small blade, set in a ring for the middle finger, or the thumb, was a much more ingenious contrivance than the common penknife, or the sliding blade; because the right hand could be employed in cutting, and
<hi rend="italics">grabbing</hi> the money at one and the same time, whilst the left might be engaged, no less usefully, in bothering his <hi rend="italics">gob</hi>. Lower down, I have introduced the case of my friend Mr. Maunder, who was cut with some such instrument severely. This latter manoeuvre is nothing more than placing the flat hand (back or palm) over the mouth

"pickpockets," or some such <hi rend="italics">stuff</hi>, when he felt the things going from his person, an event always to be deprecated.</p>
  <p>One observation, on the foregoing exposition of <persName key="Perry,Bill">Bill Perry</persName>, may not be inaptly made here. Notwithstanding the generally received notion that pickpockets are an innocent race of mortals, who merely purloin a little of your pelf, yet nothing can be more contrary to the real fact. No means of escape would be left untried, in case of detection, even although that should cost the life of an individual or two. They are invariably taught boxing, <hi rend="italics">scientifically</hi>, women as well as men; I mean so far as how to place a blow or two with the <hi rend="italics">happiest</hi> effect. Indeed, picking of pockets frequently assumes the character of footpad robbery, having all its characteristic features, of force, and violence of conduct, on the part of the perpetrators. Since this was written the Judges have condemned the offenders, capitally, as noticed at page 52. This brings me to speak of that next species of robbery, by those who are appropriately termed

Just the same end is obtained by picking an instant quarrel, and collaring the victim, the thieves pull him forward; while he is thus upon the stoop, the accomplice takes a <hi rend="italics">dive</hi> into his pockets, handing off whatever he may find to a third accomplice, who perhaps has been making free use of his stick promiscuously over the heads of all parties. Another plan is to seize him by the collar of the coat behind, and pull him backwards: he must be a rum customer, indeed, if he gets over this and a dig in the guts in front; for, having lost wind, he will not recover it again until his property is irrecoverable.</p>
  <p>A more daring hustle is, where a person being run against violently, as if by accident, and his arms kept down forcibly, while the accomplice, pretending to take <soCalled>"the gentleman's"</soCalled> part, draws either his watch, money, or book.

Those who give preference to this mode of <hi rend="italics">do</hi> are of the secondary sort of thieves, not at all to be considered <hi rend="italics">clever</hi>, but ferocious; they mostly wear short jackets, (at least one of them,) the better to effect escape by running, the cloth being made smooth, if not slippery, with grease, &amp;c.: their operations seldom commence until dusk; they never attack other than <hi rend="italics">single</hi> persons; and the fall of the year is the most prolific in this sort of crime.</p>
  <p>If this be not <soCalled>"foot-pad robbery,"</soCalled> I know not what is; the only difference seems to lie in that the robber <hi rend="italics">demands</hi> the property in one case, in the other he takes it <hi rend="italics">without asking</hi>; The genuine decent pickpocket, who does the trick in a neat way, deems himself insulted in being classed with those, as well as with the description of street robbers noticed below: he decries the use of violence upon the person robbed, unless it be in self-defence, and to make his escape.</p>

  <p>Women not only pick pockets, but hustle at night, while bestowing their unasked for caresses, adroitly entering your pockets, should you come in contact with them. A short lass, and a tall or big one, are best adapted to this business: the former forcibly contending with the latter the promised enjoyment, seizes you round the middle, lasciviously, when the business is done neatly; she hands over the things to her companion, who moves off instantly, while the other keeps you in tow until the booty is out of reach, and then she becomes uneasy until she

   <note type="header" place="head">WATCHMEN, AND WOMEN PROWLERS.</note> herself is safely out of your sight. But should you charge the watchman with her person, you would not recover the property, and the charge falls to the ground as a matter of course. I have frequently known <hi rend="italics">both</hi> women brought in and searched, but nothing was found upon them; in such cases they have a third accomplice, but generally the stolen things have been deposited in some <hi rend="italics">nook</hi> or <hi rend="italics">corner</hi> conveniently situated, near where the transaction took place -such as the interstices of window shutters, for Banknotes: or the broken corner of the same,-holes are previously dug in the mortar of walls for the express purpose,-very often the deposit is made upon the ledges where window-shutters are stowed away by day. Such are the contrivances of those wretches who prowl the streets to take advantage of silly men.</p>
  <p>A practice formerly prevailed, that has now diminished greatly, of women <hi rend="italics">standing</hi> at the ends of courts and alleys, to entice tipsy and unwary men into corners, the better to rob them. This kind of depredation is now confined to byestreets and lanes, or in the more frequented places they prowl up and down under patronage of the watchman, who takes his share of the booty, or <soCalled>"reg'lars ;"</soCalled> and I am old enough to recollect, in so public a place as facing the North-door of <placeName key="Saint Paul's">Saint Paul's</placeName>, three or four old harridans, including the wife of the watch- housekeeper, nightly took their stand, with commensurate <hi rend="italics">good luck</hi>, at the coming out of the play-

   <p>Hence, the unknowing reader will readily conclude, that when any dishonest practice by such women comes before the constable of the night, he should not suffer a watchman to go out <hi rend="italics">alone</hi>, after he has heard the charge, in which the
<hi rend="italics">scene of action</hi> is of course pointed out; as he would <hi rend="italics">take care</hi> of the property himself, and you might ascertain that he had met with it, by his becoming extremely jolly, not to say impudent, in his answers,-among other things, affecting to doubt " whether you ever had so much about you."</p>
  <p>In some watch-houses, <placeName key="St. Luke's">St. Luke's</placeName> for example, they have a small nook, or room, in which they search strumpets accused of street robbery from the person. The searching is invariably performed by the watchman and the constable of the night, who is usually one of the hired sort; and they, together, with the ready assent of the thief, seek to secrete the property stolen, by keeping out from participation not only the person robbed but any other spectator.</p>
  <p><hi rend="italics">Forceps</hi>, or blunt scissors, are sometimes found on searching thieves, that are well adapted to drawing forth loose notes from a close breeches-pocket.

As usual, she picked pockets, was had up more than once, and on one occasion had thrown the blame on a Jew fellow, her protector or husband, as I afterwards learned.  They, therefore, formed a strong party to carry her off, and this they effected, though the watchman looked on, by forcing her into a coach, after a hard struggle and much <hi rend="italics">smothered shrieking</hi> that ceased in the coach, as if she were gagged.

  <p>Now as to these, and all other personal robberies, <hi rend="italics">out of doors</hi>, I would advise a sort of

<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>

   <note type="header" place="head">COUNTERACTION-SIMPLE PEOPLE EXPOSE THEIR PROPERTY.</note> knowing circumspection, on which I made some remarks before. Suppose, for a moment, that you were to bustle through the crowd in the streets, shoving about the people; thus, in order to avoid the pickpockets, assuming yourself to be one, to all external appearance ? It is not probable you would be attacked by them, upon the old and sure principle, that <hi rend="italics">dog</hi> will not eat <hi rend="italics">dog</hi>. So, if you stare them well in the face (not sheepishly), eye them downwards,
<hi rend="italics">twig</hi> the shabbiest part of their dress,-and, if a <hi rend="italics">row</hi> is begun, you join in the phrases used, as <quote>go it ;</quote> <quote>now, d--n his eyes;</quote> <quote>what are you at ?</quote> <quote> now for it;</quote> <quote> go it my jumbo!</quote> repeating, whatever may be said upon the occasion, you would certainly increase the chances of getting clear. This phrase is what I always repeat: <quote>The <hi rend="italics">chances</hi> only of getting clear of their clutches</quote> are increased by following these precautions; for no one can be at a certainty; as I have known a police officer
(<persName key="Handcock">Handcock</persName>, of <placeName key="Hatton-garden">Hatton-garden</placeName>, in <date value="1813">1813</date>) to be stopped and robbed on the highway, when wellarmed, and an eminent magistrate who had his pocket picked at the theatre, during the O.P. row.</p>
  <p>As one test of the truth of what I have said, you may invariably discover in the person whose pocket has been picked <hi rend="italics">while walking singly</hi>, something that points him out as a proper object of attack: he is easily to be found out as an <hi rend="italics">unknowing</hi> one; he is either a silly looking chap, or an unwieldy one, or a manifest

 new-come, or a <hi rend="italics">flat</hi>, with his watch-chain and seals and the fogle, hanging temptingly forth. In making this distinction of walking <hi rend="italics">singly,</hi> I beg to claim the full force of the word; for, as to picking pockets in a crowd, it is quite a different sort of matter,-there, every body goes to wreck. The reader of any discernment, then, will see the propriety of keeping out of crowds; for in them nothing can help him, but strength to get to the outer verge as soon as possible; and that will scarcely be in his power, if he is wedged in by eight or ten desperadoes, who keep ramming him up whilst carefully concealing their faces.</p>
  <p>Need a word be said of the necessity of keeping the handkerchief concealed, if you mean to preserve it? An outside or slip pocket, in which the handkerchief is visible, is sure to part with its contents at noon-day, even, though you should not walk half the length of the Strand. The <hi rend="italics">simple</hi> hanging out this inviting flag of flatness would be most likely to bring its owner into further trouble; as so careless a mode of placing the handkerchief marks him out to <hi rend="italics">all person</hi>s for one of the <hi rend="italics">unknowing</hi> ones, he would be followed and further pilfered, as certainly as that he has a nose. <q type="spoken">" No,

<hi rend="italics">times</hi> are worse. Men who only rob occasionally are thereby driven to desperation; and they then sally forth to commit depredations on the persons of the unwary, which we, upon mature reflection, (after detection of the offenders,) frequently consider to partake in a small degree of insanity.

  <p>Therefore, it is advisable, to keep a good look out, and especially avoid fellows who are running hard, or who follow you step by step for any length of way.

  <p>These statements are exemplified often: First, the robbery of <persName key="Partridge">Capt. Partridge</persName>, near the
<placeName key="Shepherd and Shepherdess">Shepherd and Shepherdess</placeName>, now the <placeName key="Eagle-tavern">Eagle-tavern</placeName>, by three bakers (<date value="1816">1816</date>), one of whom proposed to murder him, because he made so much noise, is a proof of one part of the above proposition; for, although the place is much frequented, yet no one was nigh enough to alarm them from their purpose.  These fellows were named
<persName key="Segrim">Segrim</persName>, <persName key="Moore">Moore</persName>, and <persName key="Ball">Ball</persName>, the latter of whom became approver of evidence for the King, and the first two were hung. It seems they had seen <persName key="Partridge">Capt.

I had almost called him a <hi rend="italics">knave</hi> as well as fool; for he thereby made three <hi rend="italics">tolerably</hi> honest fellows rogues, and sent two of them to the gallows. Secondly, another part of the above statement was proved under our own observation while yet we were writing it (January, <date value="1818">1818</date>). A <persName key="Field,John">Mr. John Field</persName>, cloth-presser, of <placeName key="Addle-street">Addle-street</placeName>, <placeName key="City">City</placeName>, was
<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>
   <note type="header" place="head">CASES OF STREET-ROBBERY, DEFEATED, HOW? SIGNALS CIRCUMVENTED.</note> followed from the meeting-house in <placeName key="Moorfields">Moorfields</placeName>, along <placeName key="London-wall">London-wall</placeName>, by two of a gang who inhabit thereabout: they were short and stout; Mr. F. being a little lame in one leg, gave them good reason to expect an easy conquest, as his appearance did a good booty. At the turning into <placeName key="Basinghall-street">Basinghall-street</placeName>, (no one at that moment coming up it,) one of the rogues ran up to <persName key="Field">Mr. Field</persName>, pushed a leg between his, and brought him to the ground; instantly putting his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, he had but just time to extract a few shillings, when his accomplice became alarmed at the vociferations of the prostrate gentleman (though he already knelt upon him)-and ran away. They could not be overtaken, nor was the occurrence known beyond the circle of his own friends. It was an operation of about half a minute.</p>
  <p>Here it will be noted that the <hi rend="italics">end of a street</hi> was chosen; and hence it may be concluded that such would be always preferred, even though I did not know that <hi rend="italics">tactic</hi> before-hand. Indeed, it will scarcely be expected that I should adduce instances, or proofs, of any proposition I lay down, seeing that every word comes from actual experience, either personally, or by immediate information from the real actors in the scenes I describe. Well, then, I have to inform you, Reader, that the corner, or opposite the corner of a lane, or other avenue, is always fixed upon by the knowing ones; and the moment is that in which they come to take
<pb id="p.93" n="93"/> a glance down it, to see that it is clear of interruption. Sometimes an accomplice runs on before, to find the turning that will suit the purpose; he then goes into it a yard or two, and turns about just in time to contribute his assistance to the plundering; perhaps to receive into his arms the victim who has been knocked towards him, and to complete the <hi rend="italics">flooring</hi> of the unfortunate person.</p>
  <p>Few such cases are brought before the magistrates, by reason of the utter inability of the sufferers to give any account of the persons; but I repeat it, they happen oftener than would readily be supposed. On that account it is, I have dwelt upon particulars so long, in order that my readers may learn to avoid the dangers that thus surround them. To which permit me to add, - let them look out sharp upon hearing a whistling or calling, even although the latter should be but a person's name,
(man or woman,) or, the former the ingenious imitation of the black-bird's call to its mate. Very late at night, and in lonely situations, the adopting a whistle that resembles the thieves' is a puzzle for them not easily unravelled. The fag-end of a song is a preferable signal sometimes; though the words may not be appropriate, they convey a meaning previously agreed upon, and are as intelligible to each other as Greek to a Greek, or the sign and countersign to the guard that visits a military out-post.</p>
  <p>If two persons are in company, it is the safest

Moreover, strangers to town in particular, should be careful not to let others know what money or valuables they carry about them; and the townbred knowing ones, too, had better profit by the advice, and not submit to be drawn of their secret by the offers of preposterous wagers, the usual method of coming at a knowledge of the contents of their pockets. I verily <hi rend="italics">believe</hi> some street robberies proceed from this very cause, and are perpetrated by the supposed friends or companions of the sufferers themselves, who probably commit no other offence during their lives.</p>
  <p>In these, and still more doubtful terms, I formerly spoke of the probability of apparent friends robbing the drunken and too-confiding bearers of money: even whilst we print, we

<p><note place="head">INNKEEPERS' RECOMMENDATION  TO PRIVATE LODGINGS, INSIDIOUS.</note></p>
  <p>As to the exorbitant charges made for lodgings, to persons newly come to Town, the waiters, and other persons about the inns, are mostly to blame; they expect a gratuity for the recommendation, and this is charged upon the stranger, threefold. The plan of taking lodgings or apartments, by any one intending to remain in town some time (say a week) is most desirable on many accounts, which may all be summed up in few words; viz. the irregularity that a public-house superinduces in persons of sober habits, and the entire subversion of his commercial views, in one who is already a free liver. Either description of persons should seek out a private house to reside in, examine himself the premises and neighbourhood, and make stipulations for the supply of his comforts, his conveniences, and occasions, leaving nought to after explanations.  The terms of payment should be short, unless his luggage be large; his manners need not be repulsive, but if he indulge in familiarity, and is young, he will havesome part of the family on his back; expenses and cozening follow. Although some well-conditioned fellows do not care a brass farthing about the honesty of their lodgers, they do like vastly to know every tittle about the stranger's business, manufactory, mode of life, &amp;c. as the case maybe. If he remain long at his lodgings, impertinence is thereby engendered, unless he adroitly give
<pb id="p.105" n="105"/>

 them to understand, he can recommend to them future visitors in abundance: a view to mammon sways their future conduct.</p>
  <p>No doubt, the masters of inns and their dependants can, if they will, recommend to good and appropriate places for private living, and always do this when thronged with company; but in cases of slack trade, they are most unlikely to do so faithfully, because they would, thereby, be cutting their own throats. No: let the stranger make inquiries of tradespeople in the neighbourhood, where his business chiefly lies; of the butcher, baker, greengrocer, perhaps at some evening assembly of smoke-a-pipe citizens, where some member of the C. C. may nightly fumigate his constituents into good humour, and smoke their politics with his <quote>blow-my-dickey</quote> exclamations. The barbers' shops, where the master does not shave for the minor sum of three-halfpence a phiz, are well adapted to furnish the desired information; and having instituted the requisite investigation here and there, he may communicate the fact to the innkeeper, or his factotum, and these may then be consulted with advantage. They will now be induced to impart good, and valuable, and genuine information, purely out of opposition. Should the stranger arrive in the city, per coach, he will find many a neat, little secluded nook of a court, or <soCalled>"No thoroughfare"</soCalled> place, where such temporary accommodation may be obtained. Should his

<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>

</p><p><note place="head"> INMATECY FOR SHORT RESIDENCE;</note></p><p> occasions require a longer stay, and, consequently, fresher air than these afford; should his affairs <quote>require seclusion</quote> in his habits awhile, he will ascend towards the country, on the north, where such are to be found in profusion, and of all degrees. In the fields of Islington, now covered with houses, he, whose reason for sojourning among us may be attributed to the first mentioned or general cause, will find great variety to suit his taste; but he, alas, who is forced from his home, through adverse circumstances, during the six weeks working of his ruined prospects (?), will find safe seclusion and bodily impunity about Bethnal-green, or the ill-frequented old town of non-wise persons, at Hoxton. Bridegrooms, who receive the first commands of their brides, as to whereabout they shall spend the honeymoon, when the lady fixes her earliest longings on London, its sights, its playhouses, and its pleasures, take up with first-floors or almost entire houses, in one or other of the numerous streets that sprout from the Strand, and dip their tails in the Thames's floating-tide. These being but a step or two from the theatres, and little more from any other public exhibition, seem most eligible for those of our present class, who would <quote>come up to town to see a bit of life,</quote> whether wedded or not: but higher orders of people, with the same views, who keep a coach, take up their temporary abodes in the streets that issue out of the great squares, where

  <p>Speaking of the lodging-houses lying out of the Strand, we may say that they are chiefly under the direction of ancient servants of families as butlers, cooks, coachmen, housemaids, and others, grown old in service, with tavern- keepers out of business, and here and there the relict of some tradesman; a few of them are offshoots from neighbouring hotels, who recommend all their superabundant customers who may desiderate privacy, to these establishments; but it is not to be concealed; that here and there among these lodging-house-keepers, we may find some few who should be guarded against. The wiles and lures that some ancient females know how to direct, most unerring to their aim, and to render conducive to their own profit, would be securely put in practice, at a lodging-house of all others, laid out for the reception of single men; and I have known one such, that was placed under the superintendance of a staid female, whose previous establishment, in Covent-garden, became a house of call for high-flying cyprians, who were in the habit of calling upon her, for the self-same purposes as our outward-bound traders touch at Madeira, namely, <quote>to take in wine, to wood and water, and put themselves under convoy of men of war,</quote> if such did lie in the road.

<p>SHARPERS, strictly of the out-door genus, and whom our stranger in town is likeliest to meet with in his peregrinations, are the subtle characters we come next to discuss, in the order here set down. And truly, some among them are fearful fellows to deal with, and equally as

Not a jot. What signifies it to the sufferer, whether he be knocked down by the bludgeon of a thief, or run the risk of his life through the machinations of false accusers ? Both aim at his money, and both cringe to him for their lives, when these become forfeited, since none but rank cowards, when they have resolved to turn rogues, would so conduct their crimes. But forgiveness in this, as in many other cases, is an offence against the well-being of society, according to the true civic creed.</p>
  <p>Let our stranger be as wary of downright thieves as we may favourably suppose these instructions have made him, he is still liable to fall into the clutches of more refined rogues, whose dexterities are mostly confined to the tongue, and making wrong appear the better reason. Mock-auctions and <quote>selling-off</quote> shops are not the only pests where barkers are kept at the doors to invite unwary passengers to I walk in, walk in, sale just begun, <quote>with full mouthed garrulity and hoarse tones, the joint effects of gin and long exposure to practise in the open air.

Happily, the places where those disgraceful scenes chiefly lie are somewhat remote from general resort: Rosemary-lane, Seven-dials, and Fieldlane, neither attract casual visitors, nor lie in great thoroughfares, from any one noted point to another; though Houndsditch is certainly

When those fellows were showing me from room to room, and dragging me up stairs and down, I used to manage so as to carry off portable articles, as inkbottles, plated cruet-stands, small tea-caddies, and such like sort of little things, as would easily squeeze flat, and stow away beneath my gaberdine."</q> I may, however, repeat what I have said elsewhere, and that is, <quote> knock the man down, or, indeed, the woman, who dares to touch you with the hands; should you wish to decline this, at least, huff the offender with

  <p>So far as the barkers are concerned, these pests of the mercantile world obtained notice a few pages back with their <soCalled>"Walk in !"</soCalled> Having so walked in, such made up auctions are easily distinguished from real ones, notwithstanding they assume all the external marks of genuineness, even up to advertising in the newspapers, and being held in the house of a person lately gone away, or absolutely dead. They are called mock auctions, because no intention exists
<pb id="p.115" n="115"/>

           </p><p><note place="head">MOCK-AUCTION TRICKS.</note></p><p> of selling under certain prices, previously fixed upon; which, although not high, is invariably too much for the quality of the goods- which are again of a very inferior cast. And they are further known, by the anxiety evinced to show the goods to strangers the moment they enter; by the overstrained panegyrics bestowed upon every thing put up; by the exacerbated vocabulary of the auctioneer, who endeavours to jest, to bully, and to jaw you into a purchase, asking you, in a petulant way, what you offer for this, that, and the other ? All night auctions are of this sort; the seller having purchased the goods for the express purpose of auctioning them off, often pushing the price exorbitantly beyond the real value; asseverating that the manufacturer never will be paid, and increasing his earnestness the more he lies, in order to keep up the delusion.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, though the sale has not begun when you enter, they will immediately commence business, and perhaps one among them will pretend to make a purchase; not only so, he will even pay down the money, so that this is likely to induce you to make.a bidding. An equally deep manoeuvre is the offer to take back, or exchange, the articles under sale, for others, in a day, a week, or ten days. This is more particularly the case with watches; but if you do so take them back, you pay through the nose for the exchange, and you find out too late you had better have taken Dr. Johnson's advice,

  <p>On the other hand, it is not to be denied, that many bargains are met with at auctions of even the worst sort; and more especially was this the case during the late years of distressed trade, when manufacturers and 'large holders of goods were in the habit of raising the wind by sending their property to be sold for what it would fetch at the <quote>manufacturers' salesmen's</quote> auction, be that much or little. But here double destruction awaited them, in manner and form following. On all such occasions, as much money in advance is required as can be obtained, and is complied with to some extent; but this being ever insufficient for the pressing necessities of the seller, which increase in the exact ratio that prices fall, the auctioneer proposes to give his <soCalled>"own acceptances "</soCalled> at once for the sum total; which done, to render the matter still worse, he incites the deluded man to go on making more goods and more, to an immense amount. Before the bills become due, the acceptor decamps, the MART (as such places are still called) changes hands, once or twice, into the possession of his coadjutors, and after undergoing other transmogrifications, it is at length shut up, whilst the deluded vender goes to a prison to learn the particulars of his own undoing, and to lament over his folly or

<pb id="p.117" n="117"/>
     </p><p><note place="head"> EXPOSURE OF THEIR PRACTICES.</note></p><p> his misfortunes. In the prison, probably, he meets with one or other of the parties to his undoing, who had acted as clerk, adjunct, or partner in the fraudful concern, who is there serving out his time under the <soCalled>"Insolvent Act,"</soCalled>-termed <quote>taking the benefit.</quote></p>
  <p>This was precisely as it happened at the famous mart, outside Temple-bar, kept by little Williams. His history would prove highly instructive: he had been a traveller for Major Blundell, opened a warehouse in Newgatestreet, and moved to Picket-street, as a retailer, but soon converted the premises to a mart. Here he did <soCalled>"the natives"</soCalled> for the third time, transferring his effects to one or other of his colleagues. Among his finishing feats, may be reckoned his taking in a poor fellow for a thousand silk hats, and a foreigner for twice the number of chip ones; a Yorkshireman for a great quantity of second broad cloths, another clothier for kerseymeres and pelisse-cloths, and other people for butts of stout, beer, and pipes of wine, which he bottled off, and caroused over, until all burnt blue. All this, to say nothing of linen-drapery, which assumed to be the staple commodity at Williams's mart.</p>
  <p>Goods so bought, the most casual observer will see, were easy of sale, though there might be but just so many people in town as required such articles, and would take them off. Accordingly, the silk hats were sold at three shillings each less than the invoice-prices; the

       </p><p><note place="head">BARGAIN HUNTING</note></p><p> cloths in somewhat the same proportion, and the wine was bartered away to one Jeremy, in Holborn, for his old-fashioned stock of drapery, but the value was afterwards recovered by the assignees of Tom Williams by an action at law. After Williams's retreat, one Martial made an abortive attempt to continue the fun, as Dick Futner used to term it; but Martial failed, for want of that gumption, or decidedly rogues' tricks, which is necessary to the performance of great actions. After this exposition of the non-intention to pay the original manufacturer, who can doubt that great bargains were to be had, while <quote>the fun</quote> lasted, upon the principle of <quote>cheap come, cheap go?</quote> But, then, for careful people, to whom saving might be an object, the time taken up in attending the hourly lounge, the danger of being induced to buy super-necessary articles, [that are always total loss,] the circumspection indispensable on the part of the purchasers, to avoid being deceived in the articles they do want, altogether contribute to render bargain-hunting, at the very best of mock auctions, dangerously experimental.  Hereby is disproved the old housewives' adage, which holds that <quote>a penny saved is a penny got.</quote> Hundreds have found out the futility of the pursuit, yet are numbers daily seen in attendance near the same neighbourhood, and at other mock-auctions all over town, that start up occasionally, and <quote>hold on the uneven tenour of their way,</quote> for a longer or

 <p> Generally speaking, all continuous auctions are cheats-nay, universally so, if we substitute the word deceptions for cheats, whether held by day or by night. If we excepted aught from this malediction, it would be the sales of printed books, especially of second-hand books; old, erudite, or classical scholars, without previous introduction, find no means of personally inspecting the stores of our booksellers, as formerly, when their shops presented an arrangement little superior to the modern book-stall, though ranged tier above tier, on flat railings. Thus, a hundred years since, John Gay sings:</p>
   <p>The bookseller, whose shop's an open square,
   Foresees the tempest, and with early care
   Of learning strips the rails.
   Men of genius, those of studious habits, the student just risen from his desk, the ardent reader, cormorant of books, and the lounger who would kill time, all frequent <quote>sales of books,</quote> of whatever kind, and love to roam through the well-stocked library wherever access is unobstructed.  For the most part, unblest with affluence, they dread to ask the price of an unmarked article, lest the wary bookseller, taking advantage of their preference, enhance the price of his commodity, in expectation of having the best at chaffering for its

<quote> auctioning-off</quote> of modern books also. True, it offers to persons less recherchee, to mere idlers, the ready means of supplying themselves with food for the mind; and, although the species of learning acquired in this desultory manner, is far removed from desirable knowledge in the present possessors, as rendering them querulous, invariably argumentative, and repulsively self- important, has produced upon the rising generation better habits of acquiring enlarged intellect, and more accurate modes of thinking than characterized their parents; who are dropping or have dropped into the silent tomb, full of civic garrulity, with the memory of hustings' oratory, and turbulent politics of one or the other extreme. The task might be pleasant, and would certainly be instructive, to pursue an extensive investigation into the history of the rise and progress of the present extended tastefor reading, if the inquiry were carried no further; upon us it devolves as a duty to give at least a luminous sketch, since London was the chief theatre of its maturation.<note place="foot" n="1">During the quarter of a century that this change in the aggregate of mind was working itself out, the prognoses and the corresponding symptoms of its approach, called forth the astonishment of allmen, and acquired the admiration of some, whilst others deprecated the <quote>march of intellect,</quote> as if it had been the march of Attila to the
 plains of Champagne, or the approach of the one-eyed
 general to those of Cannae. The latter, the active intolerants, were long time the most numerous party in the
 land: they already held the purse-strings of the nation,
 became possessed of the chief places of profit, of influence, and of church-government; whereby they constantly attracted to their ranks, also, the most enlightened
 of the other, or liberal party, because these placed no
 delight in riches; and their best politicians were usually
 too poor to be honest, as regarded abstract questions,
 whence arise the practices ofgovernment. What followed,
 or accompanied, those sears upon public feelings,the Bute
 influence over the royal mind, with the privy chamber
 appointment of succeeding high-prerogative administrations, but the arbitrary Scottish taxation of America,
 upon the advice of a wire-drawn, Glasgow-taught, writer
 on trade, Adam Smith by name, which produced war
 and the loss of thirteen flourishing colonies, with as many
 hundred miles of sea coast, which, (like the house that
 Jack built,) in its course entailed on us debt, and heaps of
 misery and almost ruin; that produced the general ferment
 of Europe, and engrafted shame on all its monarchs or
 their servants ; that overloaded us with taxes, whilst the
 perpetrators inhumanly increased the weight by jumping-up themselves; that nearly lost us India, ruined our
 manufactures, banished awhile our specie, and filled the
 country with distress and the lamentation of all ranks,
 including among the latter, the battened harpies themselves, the harshest croakers being those who had most
 recently risen from the puddle !
 In the midst of this conflict of opinions, and struggle
 for power, or for existence, observant people saw without astonishment, that the spirit of inquiry was gone forth, in its most searching form, and discussion was at its height, embodied in suggestions of charlatan remedies, of proposals for a more beneficial and less expensive mode of administering the affairs of the nation, in speculating upon new sources of wealth, improvements in manufactures, machinery, gas, steam, and discoveries in art and science. Though inquiry was upon the full alert, the mind did not expand in proportion to its activity: though books increased in number, their quality was generally of the most mawky nature; projects abounded, schemes addled the heads of a few, patents passed in regimental array, and people required to be told what all this note of preparation and din of execution meant. The number of new books published annually, which, in <date value="1788">1788</date>, did not amount to three hundred, in <date value="1808">1808</date>, exceeded eight hundred different works; the mode of publication in small portions, which had obtained from the days of Benjamin Martin and Smollett, in small numbers, not exceeding two or three thousand each work, at most, so increased about the latter year, that two obscure individuals procured sale for at least two hundred and fifty thousand copies of a two-guinea publication, besides numerous other works from the same press, and many other presses moving with the same activity. All these works now under consideration came out in sixpenny portions, and when the cheap supply of substantial books, for various reasons assigned in the text, fell short of the demand, this facile mode of obtaining expensive works, became the parent of a still more extensive means of diffusing the marrow of the best books, that were selected and culled without mercy, and republished in portions of two-pence or three-pence each, to the amount, at one time, of forty-three distinct titles weekly. Their authors are noticed farther down.</note></p>

The advancement of many from these classes to civic honours, or at any rate to the gaze and admiration of parish auditory, or of charitable subscriptions, gave an impulse to the reading mania that was at once natural and striking. Hence, the desire of spreading substantial authors increased at a wonderful rate, and like the accumulation of a sand-bank, reproduced itself; the flimsy novelists and hackneyed <soCalled>"histories"</soCalled> were abandoned, when the sales of books numerously and rapidly succeeded each other throughout the country: no other goods were so transmitted for auction sales, whence we infer that printed books alone are the legitimate objects of such a mode as that wherein the articles seldom were pronounced  <quote>gone,</quote> or actually sold, under cost price. This, it must be conceded, partook, in an essential manner, of the character of Mock-auctions; but then the book-auctioneer was furnished with numerous copies of the same work, and if he procured a fair price for a few, the residue mightgo for what they would fetch, and thus great bargains in this line were often obtained. It is true, that some (indeed a great proportion) of the articles of such <quote>stocks</quote> deserved no better fates being the refuse of certain great booksellers' ware-

 REJECTED LITERATURE; THE ADVANCE houses, or the remainders of such large editions as the public disdained to <quote>take off</quote> by the usual methods of announcement, of puff, and purchased panegyric. Old John Stockdale was a great adventurer in this line, after he had tried on several other modes of dispensing learning he could not possess, and he was followed or preceded by many others, with like qualifications. In the transmission of large stocks of such <soCalled>"remainders,"</soCalled> from the publishing booksellers, or their heirs, to ferretting booksellers, who disseminated their purchases, it is a remarkable fact, that none but the most ignorant of their own body, interlopers, made any figure as <quote>trade-auctioneers : </quote>if any one more intelligent, as to spelling the titles aright, or other clerical denotation, endeavoured to direct their internal sales, <quote>the trade</quote> coalesced in this, though in no other general measure whatever, to kick him out; a King, a Hone, a Rider, or a Taylor, they eschewed as beings of another order.</p>
  <p>Exploded learning, mistaken notions, false doctrines, or, at least, rejected literature, that was so promulged could operate no good, but gratify the craving appetite for reading, that is destined never to be satiated. At length, the owners of large prime stocks withheld them, extensive publishers neither died or run away, but the shoals of new publications, at high prices, still went on, amidst the universal cry of <quote>shame</quote> at the extravagance of authors and

<pb id="p.125" n="125"/>

        </p><p><note place="head"> OF SHOALS OF LOW AUTHORS.</note></p><p>
 cupidity of book-publishers. This outcry gave rise, as seemed inevitable, to a fresh shoal of authors</p>

<note><p>They were of all orders and every degree, from him who could just mark out, in other publications, the more striking and interesting passages, according to his own taste, to the higher class who assumed to criticise upon an author, to make a remark on his beauties or incongruities, or to act the simple part of an usher, who undertakes to introduce a favourite to the public; several among them were barbers, and three housepainters out of employment, many handicraftsmen, and one really a chimney-sweeper's boy. Nor any disparagement either, provided these persons conducted their new affairs with moderation, which was not the case: they had been embued too strongly with the  <quote>exploded literature</quote> alluded to in the text; they inflated themselves with the airs supposed to belong to great or exquisite genius; their productions, therefore, fell to the ground in myriads, and were succeeded by others; and when they ventured to write what they might think, or sat down to think upon what they should write- flatulency, vapour, assumption, borrowed plumes, base imitation, denoted all their productions.  Critics treated them with entire neglect, or caustically noticed their
<quote>best got up things,</quote> with appalling brevity; the authors retaliated with personal abuse, for they believed themselves infallible, and attributed theirhard fate to envy: as a rebutter, their tormenters termed them theirs' Caco-fogo style, unknown to any but themselves. Some of them prudently retired to their original avocations, whilst others keep the field in various shapes and with varied fortune, as they do with accusations and recriminations without number; the result whereof has been repeated exposure of gross venality, corruption, and utter incapacity for their newly assumed employments, before the courts of law, in the shape of two penny damages.
 <lb/>Of the rival twopenny publications some half a dozen were concocted, successively, by a junto of wrongheads, meeting together over their cups at the little coffee-shop in St. Martin's Court, Ludgate; where the party daily held a literary conversazione, in distant imitation of those at ' the Chapter,' or those others recorded with tedious minuteness, by James Boswell, the jackal of Sam. Johnson. Those projectors, however, are vanished all into thin, thin air, some of them literally dead, whilst most of the shoal expiated their offences into K. B. or C.P., by compromise, or by <quote>a declaration in Chancery.</quote>  It was pleasant enough to see the ineffable coxcombry of one of these, as in a <quote>Mirror,</quote> whining under the effects of hot salt-water baths, in the Summer of <date value="1824">1824</date> and <date value="1825">1825</date>: <q type="spoken">"Will our readers bear with us one more week at Brighton ?"</q>

  <p>Notwithstanding I mean to pursue the subject of those and similar literatists, under a separate head, I could not refrain from the propriety of pushing this exposition so far, evidently arising, as this mockery does, out of another, viz, mock-auctions; for those sell themselves to the best bidder as these do their goods, as often as they can find purchasers, at equally unmerited prices too, and their productions are as factitiously got up as the razors before alluded to, with the additional fact, that the materials are clandestinely obtained.</p>
  <p>Mock-auctions of furniture are frequently held at the auctioners' own rooms, are regularly advertised, and never fail to attract companies, part of which are hired persons-women as well as men, at a poor daily stipend: those for general purposes now existing, in addition to the beforementioned outside Temple-bar, may be found nightly in St. Martin's le Grand, above Holborn-bars, in Ludgate-street, and Leicestersquare; whilst that which went on for several years at the corner of Water-lane, Fleet-street, has ceased for the present; as hath, for two years, the daily mockery near Queen-street, in Cheapside, where Mr. Knockemdown has a mote in his eye as well as in his good name, whilst he bore invariably the farina of wheat on his mean

   <p>Duffers and Buffers, both belong to the same species of keen traders, the latter being a novel genus arising out of the former; and although these seem to have passed away with the new circumstances attending our free-trade system, yet as the principles that dictated this line of policy may probably give way to the old arbitrary impolitic acts of exclusion and prohibition, we expect the return of buffing at no distant period; for the supporters of coercion and proscription, and lovers of starched morals, only retire from our sight awhile to return again with fresh vigour.</p>

When Mr. Barrington did his <soCalled>"Spy,"</soCalled> they might, and probably did, carry their goods always about them, and show them in the streets; now, however, they carry on trade in a more genteel manner, leaving a pack at some public-house, near where they mean to ply for customers.</note> are a refinement upon the foregoing, or rather an abasement, according as the operations of the latter may be viewed, or suffered, by the party passing an opinion.

Should you ultimately refuse to purchase, you must put up with a great deal of abuse, provocations to lay wagers, and to fight, or go through with the quarrel by contending against fearful odds. Whatever money you produce never returns to your pockets again; the landlord is sure to take part against you, <quote>for the credit of his house;</quote> and all present will declare themselves ready to swear that you have perpetrated such infernal things as in fact you never once so much as thought of.

  <p>From this exposition, the reader will perceive the extreme danger of suffering himself to be goaded into the purchase of any article whatsoever in the street: they are invariably cheats who attempt to vend articles of wear in such a flying manner.  The shortest way with all such casual cattle is to decline the least particle of conversation with them; and if they place a finger on your arm to stop your progress-peremptorily bid them <quote>hands off;</quote> or, if you have sufficient strength-knock them into the kennel-a severe, intelligible, and most appropriate rebuke.

Upon the most casual occasions, or after some impertinent interference, invented for the purpose, as the beauty of your dog, admiration of your horse, assistance in supposed trouble, or pretended recognition, or in a mailcoach, or at the races, a most charmingly welldressed, very fine spoken sort of a gentleman, whose education at school (by the way) has generally

  <p>These are of two sorts, or rather the same persons and their associates, under two different aspects. 1st. Those who obtain goods, under false pretences, of town resident shopkeepers, as well as of the minor manufacturers, who visit town occasionally, to vend their goods; and, 2dly, those who sell goods of any description, in detail, about from house to house, and in public-houses, where newly-come persons may lodge during their visit, or casually sojourn for refreshment. Shabby swindlers, who order home goods and change for a sovereign, then way-lay the messenger and obtain both, as Parson Nightingale served Parsons, the bookseller, rightfully belong to another page of this volume ; as do those who take fine houses, and order in goods on credit, which they convert into money for their subsistence, or to live a short life and a merry one, joyously: master, mistress, coachman, cook, being all in the mess, upon equal terms; as was the case with Daffy Swinton, subsequently hung, and more recently, of the pseudo De Courcy 1 reland, now in the county prison for debtors. It is worthy of remark, that De Courci (as he sometimes wrote) and his coachman are both located in the same large room, where the latter is head-man, so never condescends to speak to his kind master. Och, bad luck to the warmhearted sons of Ould Erin, when the molehills become Mountains, and the varlets forget

 </p><p><note place="head">COUNTRY MANUFACTURERS DONE UP.</note></p><p> their former low situations. Note, Reader, the due march of events: De Courci is since quodded for coining.</p>
  <p>Birmingham goods and broad-cloths constitute two extensive articles for jobbing-off in the manner just alluded to, among the shopkeepers; and some of the bringers of such goods would recollect old customers and former dealers, with whom they have hitherto done business, and to whom they apply to take off their present stocks; perhaps, in vain; for times alter, or they would chaffer for greater bargains: or the vendor inquires after any unfavourable reports  <quote>as to credit,</quote> or something happens, or is insinuated, as to those old purchasers, and a better market, so as to render the assistance of an agent, or useful man, necessary. He it is, of whom we now come to speak; for he <quote>does business</quote> for the countryman, and, ultimately, does his business for him, in four instances out of five. These are the species of countrymen, to whom I alluded at an early page (10), as continuing always green, notwithstanding their frequent trips to Town.</p>
  <p>One of the commonest manoeuvres of the agent is, to procure for his country friend, a purchaser, as rotten and unprincipled as himself, whom he recommends in vivid terms, as
"<q type="spoken">one of the surest paymasters in the market, as the times go."</q> Ultimately, those two worthies go snacks, that is not an equal division; but the least-wise agent, is usually fobbed-off

He usually pays the expenses of two or three carousals, and also treats, incontinently, to glasses and pots, until the eve of his commercial finale.</p>
   <p>Frequently it has happened, that the countryman remained so long in town, that he is compelled to make a forced sale for cash, which he does at a great loss, and the agent who transacts this business seldom brings back the whole money, nor shows himself for a day or two, having, meantime, laid out (detained) part for himself: he subtracts part of the proceeds in the same manner, when the harassed vendor is persuaded to pawn a piece or two of cloth: then Sam le Barber, an able man, or a Proctor look out for a Purser, who advances the cash, with a ticket, implying equity of redemption, and places the goods on the shelves of his London-wall, for twelve months. Cotterell was long-time esteemed a very good <soCalled>"uncle,"</soCalled> by Clarke, and those just mentioned; but <q type="spoken">"'tis not every body that chooses to carry an end of cloth to Watling-street, right across Cheapside; no, none but smutty Sam would condescend so to run in the face of the trade:"</q> he would go further, and do more: an Oxford-street jaunt, or taking off a cut of two or three yards, were neither difficult or uncommon operations with him, who, from his dress, or undress, obtains the

  <p>Yet Sam gave his advice with apparent candour, and some knowledge, at times; for he understood trap, had taken his degrees, walked the Bench, and been aboard the Fleet.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">"Selling out-and-out is better by half, if you do make a sacrifice, than placing your goods in Joe-pardy ;"</q> and straightway, with this impression, they sought <soCalled>"the warehousemen,"</soCalled> a species of jobbers who buy every thing that comes to hand, if that transaction can rightly be termed buying, by which the articles brought in change owners at a ruinous depression. These general-dealer-warehousemen are very rogues, to a man. I have treated them as receivers of stolen goods, in a subsequent page, which they acknowledge, unblushingly, to be a just description of their trade.</p>
  <p>Such are the characters, in species and individually, into whose hands or clutches the stranger visitant is likely to fall, who resorts to London to sell his goods. No matter how wary, however circumspect he be, those kind of gentry usually prove an over-match for him, if he stand much in need of the needful, as
<quote>half cash, half bill</quote> (the most fascinating kind of offer) is no uncommon proposal, when the bill is never intended to be paid. Further details of the practices of the warehousemen, or purchasers of goods, <quote>no matter how obtained,</quote> belong to a subsequent chapter. I

  <p>Travelling tradesmen, vendors of goods, are but the seconds, or counterpart, of the preceding, and but for the difference of their manners and connexions, might be classed with the duffers. Great variety of goods, or <quote>general articles,</quote> are carried about by them from house to house, and, of course, to public-houses or other places of resort. One word of advice is alone sufficient for the entire class:-deal not with them; for the single circumstance of your being a stranger is sufficient to raise their cupidity. Let the cockneys deal with them that like it; they, probably, may match tolerably well with the runabouts, who knock at their doors a score times a day, and keep their old wives a-gate, answering to their calls when they should be getting the dinner ready.</p></div2>

This is one of the reasons, and the damnable frequency of such accusations another, that has induced me to sift the subject a little finer than suits my general purpose; the hope of being serviceable in distinguishing the true from the false accusation, my motive. <quote>Neither shall justice be sold</quote> is one of the clauses of Magna-charta; and the King, who is the general accuser, (by fiction of law,) will suffer no man to do that in his name which he cannot do himself, or by his accredited servants: all who transgress in this particular are guilty of greater crime, if the accusation be true, than if it be false, for they then sell justice; whereas, if money be obtained by false accusation, the offence is simply highway. robbery; to effect which, the victim has been put in fear of his life, as much as if the accuser had placed a pistol to his head, and left him to guess whether it might be loaded or not.</p>
  <p>False, or at best unfounded, accusation may be employed beneficially at times; but then it resembles the murder of a criminal in the streets; the irregularity of the act of retribution seems sanctioned by the previous evil conduct of the sufferer, only justice has not taken its due course, nor legal conviction had, nor a cool even-handed judicial example been set to the surrounding awe-struck populace.

Small instruction could be derived from the particulars of the interview, further than the fact of extorting four score pounds for seclusion in a small house, in a stinking corner, in possession of a smouchy-talking pair, full of cajolery-the

  <p>Accusation of crime of the most revolting nature was very frequent at one time of day; in some cases, with small appearance of truth on the face of the charge; in others, subsequent disclosures justified the first allegation, in great measure, if not to the full; but it is not to be denied, that many persons living respectably in society are found unceasingly accusatory on one lamentable propensity in others, and do much moral harm by general censure, as they also inflict unmerited pain by particular allusions. If there be any truth in the averment, why not fix the crime specifically at once? Why prefer to whiffle away the fair fame of individuals, or censure the whole: age in such a manner as to prepare it for the most disgusting results?  The great prevalence of the crime, or rather the disposition to make it a topic of conversation, calls for enlargement, a little out of its place, with the hope of abating both the one and the other subject of complaint. Allowing, for a moment, that those censors are neither corrupt or mistaken, by what motives

How would those wholesale slanderers of the age drop down upon their own shameful hearts, if they were asked whether they would be considered apologists, or simply as general accusers, or as the actual depositaries of a hateful secret that they now wish to propagate and teach to a willing audience? Do any among them seek to subtract from individual guilt by generalizing the charge ?  In fine, let us be told why is the abominable subject ever mooted ?  For we mainly attribute the spread of this as well as many other crimes of a secret nature to the familiar every-day conversations that are held in taverns, in drinking parties, and other mixed assemblages of the young, the vicious, and the inexperienced, where no thorough-bred cockney would be considered a novice, and the vilest souls take the lead of all tongues, and not- unfrequently out-talk themselves.</p>
  <p>Whilst inflicting this rebuke, I hesitate not to aver that a great portion of the flimsy, the emollient, and the foreign-taught among us, are sadly imbued with this revolting propensity.

How this kind of interference is to be set about, we hesitate to advise, and disdain to write down; but following the more appropriate course of guide and safeguard, we may usefully quote the heads of a few cases connected with this topic, the last of which, in point of time, excited the foregoing reflections. That they prove something both ways, is no objection to either, in the views we have taken of the lamentable subject.  It is in the nature of some crimes to reproduce others of their own kind, unpunished murder, for example, or the gaudy impunity of an undetected robber; in the case under consideration, the indiscreet expository anathemas of the expurgators before alluded to superinduce the pryings of curiosity, and seem to call for the accusatory aid of the venal.</p>
  <p>Early in July, <date value="1827">1827</date>, a soldier accused a wretch of making proposals to him, infamously non-natural, and also alleged that another of the same stamp had offered him <soCalled>"hush-money,"</soCalled> on his <quote>kicking up a bubbery</quote> at the publichouse, where it happened-the above Chandosstreet, in St. Martin's Lane. The matter came on at Bow-street, before Sir Richard Birnie, when B---n, the landlord, attended to prove the whole a malicious affair, only contrived to extort money. An accusation made singly, and

B--n admitted that <q type="spoken">"some such a charge had once before been talked about."</q> Whereat we were surprised to hear the persons present express their conviction that the soldier's charge was thus primarily corroborated; than which conclusion none could be more untenable, for he might have been excited to make this charge in consequence of the first accusation having met his ears, and not the less so because that one also concerned a soldier.  Sir Richard next inquired if B-- n kept any female servants?  <q type="spoken">"None,"</q> replied the Wretch: man cook, man waiter and chamberlain, argues a profoundly bad taste, not only in the landlord of a pothouse that is the resort of soldiers and persons who hesitate to avow their avocations in life-but, also, at those superior hotels and taverns, in which assemble the magnates of the land, against whom the breath of slander has never raised its pestilence, much less the mere 'licensed victualler,' like the culpritlooking B---n, whose trade hung upon the magistrate's admonition-<q type="spoken">"take care of your license !"</q> A threat, by the way, that has been

  <p>False accusations and true ones rendered nugatory, by the extortion of hush-money, for this particular offence, have been but too numerous of late years in the metropolis. In Dublin, however, a man accused the Bishop of Clogher, a scion of a noble and ancient race, publicly,

  <p>Just so it happened to a soldier of the-- regiment of Foot-guards, whose nickname of Nancy Cooper designated his character, as the givers of it considered; but he, unlike poor Byrne, did not survive to see the disgrace of his prosecutor. Nancy was hanged at Newgate-door, for accusing a certain gentleman, in the Strand, of a beastly offence, said to have been committed in St. James's Park. Now, this wretch might have spoken the truth, in both his cases; namely, that which conferred upon him his Nanny-title, as well as that which cost him his last fling; but by his demand for hush-

  <p>Differing somewhat in the result was the case of Goodman and Fisher, who were condemned to death, for extorting hush-money from one Jones, a publican, living in the neighbourhood of Broadway, Blackfriars, under pretence that he had taken improper liberties with the person of one of them, whilst viewing the caricature-shop of John Fairburn, there, and for which offence, they alleged, he merited prosecution.  Similar accusations had been preferred against other wretches for their malepractices at this very spot; and the eyes of the neighbours being naturally directed towards the frequenters of this caricature exhibition, this Jones was recognised by the neighbours, as one who daily loitered among the throng remarkably long and suspiciously. After the capital conviction of the offenders, those people came forward to attest to the last mentioned fact, and Mr. Smith, the pork-butcher, next door, among the rest, assisted in making those representations to the Secretary-of-State, whereby sentence was respited, and finally commuted to transportation for life.</p>

Terrified! I say terrified ! why, I should have knocked him down at once."</q> That is to say, presuming upon his innocence, a position we always take for granted, when the accuser of the crime has sought to extort money as the price of his silence, unless (like this witness) the demand has been complied with by him more than once. But, in the particular instance where those words were used, we had subsequent reason to believe the imputation was not wholly without foundation; and 1 am sorry to add my reluctant assent to the general sentiment, that some cause, however slight, always exists to lay the party under suspicion. The habit of frequenting such company as lie under suspicion, or where they tolerate queer practices (to give them no worse name) without rebuke, or in despite of the admonitions of some grave personage, is quite enough to bring a man's reputation to book; at least, he cannot complain, though one of the fellows present in any such general or mixed company accosts him with the bitterly familiar recollection that "<q type="spoken">they had met together before at so and so,"</q> naming the undoubted inferno.

The iniquity of these proceedings was fully discussed in my former volume on these subjects,
<date value="1818">1818</date>; the system of rewards was proved to have been founded in an erroneous estimate of public virtue and private principle, and they were, two years afterwards, abrogated-the judges now having the power to certify when officers deserve well of the country, and the magistrates of divisions and of districts writing orders upon the county treasurer for payment, when the expenses of prosecution are directed by the judge to be allowed.

  <p>The John Bull Sunday paper is professedly a scandalising chronicle-of great powers, certainly, but of most mischievous tendencies, leaving politics out of consideration. It attacks, vehemently, the families, wives and children, of the opposite party; their peculiarities, oddities, pursuits, qualifications, and vices, if they have any; and what manner of person is without ? And, if without, some juries have sworn that the John creates.  Ever teeming with quirks, and jibes, and biting paragraphs, and subtle <soCalled>"communications,"</soCalled> concerning the character, and person, and family of a late member for Wiltshire, we were all at once struck aghast, as by an air-gun explosion, at the vacuity of John's columns, regarding the member, and all about him.  Even AEsop Spring, the City-road orator, who had been employed by the member some years since, in the ginshop and licensed victualler inquiry, could not convey to us one intelligible guess at the reason; though the impression left by one of his hour-long speeches was, that the said Phrygian's patron had broken a limb at Brussels.

Thus the above matter rested, until October, <date value="1827">1827</date>, when an indictment, <quote> Rex versus Shackell,</quote> publisher of the Bull, was tried in the Court of King's Bench-and the defendant found guilty of publishing a libel, in which the learned Mr. Heber was said to have expatriated himself,  <quote>in consequence of his attachment</quote> to the translation of Cornu-cervi. Let us not propagate the disgraceful lie. By that verdict, the plaintiff completely justified his character from the imputations of John, nor do we feel any inclination to keep open the sore; but the disgusting facts were thus published, that <quote>the learned</quote> was unhappily also one of <soCalled>"the contaminated,"</soCalled> and that <quote> the member</quote> had been detected in flagrante delictu by a footman, or some such fellow.  This AEsop knew, no doubt, when he mystified our inquiries, and so did the scandalous chronicler; but when the Brussels news reached the Bull, he magnanimously ceased to persecute the fallen man, and has never mentioned him since!

  <p>But many and vexatious are the smaller accusations brought at our police offices by busy officers who desire, in this way, to manifest their superior vigilance, before the magistrates and their employers, in order to obtain promotion. Hired parish officers, policemen seeking to be put on the establishment, special watchmen, paid by particular districts, or single merchants, to prove that they do not receive their salaries for doing nothing, look out, hard and sharp, for every trivial offender they can lay hands on. Some catch hold of such periodically; but further consideration of these matters, as regards officers, watchmen, and the whole paraphernalia of police, is discussed further down.

I do not mean they hold communion, or at all act after a fixed plan; but I do mean to say, that the chief object with all night-prowlers being those who may not be in a condition to take care of themselves, whereby they fall an easy prey-and that the guardians of the night finding these more profitable captives than the thieves, these latter escape, whilst all sorts of monstrous charges are laid to the account of the drunken man or <soCalled>"night offender,"</soCalled> they thus all join in the same pursuit.

  <p>On all such occasions, false charges and the most preposterous stories, built upon trivial bases, laid at the police offices next morning, are of every-day occurrence, and well- understood to mean a trifle to be paid to each of the accusers for making it up. This is shabby work; but there is no way of remunerating the night-guardians properly for their services but by thus levying fines on the disorderly.</p>
  <p>False accusations, however, do not attach exclusively to the watchman-character. I recollect, in <date value="1808">1808</date>, a grocer, of Newgate-street, Brandon, by name, charging a watchman of his ward with stealing his watch; but after a long examination, and the charge being entered in the book, against the supposed thief, the lost tattler was discovered at the knee of his inexpressibles, by the houseman's wife, an old harridan, up to snuff in all things pertaining thereto. Master Brandou had been immorally inclined that evening, and paid the accused, as compensation, some trivial damages. In the same watchhouse, some four years previous, George Medcalf, one of the city representatives, accused old Warren, the beadle, of participating in the benefits derived from appoint-

Hereupon the councilman caned the ward-beadle round the house, and the latter, by order of the city, prosecuted the former to conviction, before the Recorder, and immaculacy personified in duodecimo-a London Jury.</p>

  <p>Trivial as the foregoing true picture of a night adventure may pass with some, the rational reader is desired to take into consideration, that imprisonment in a real dungeon for two whole days and a fraction, (for Christmas fell on a Monday,) and undergoing an examination at Bow-street, in the face of a long- concocted charge of seven hard-swearing watchmen, is no child's play-to say nothing of the usual mulct, or the emblazonment deemed necessary to the support of the penny-a-line reporters for an o'erweening press--sad Wights.</p>
  <p>Life itself, however, is sometimes put to the stake on the charge of intemperate vicious persons, upon accusations of the most improbable nature, as applied to the accused.

  <p>Officers' accusations against poor persons, unprotected individuals, old basket-women, carters, cattle-drivers, and the like, do not always merit credence for their fidelity, seldom for their humanity. Some years ago, a fellow

From crimping for one service or two, in which their subjects ran great risk of life, to crimping for any other service-the step was easy, if not eli gible; indeed, the graduation from one to the other, from a calculable risk to a certain loss of life, is but an inclined plane, obvious, profitable, and readily surmounted. What frightful murders did we not hear of, along shore, soon after the peace had rendered his trade a nullity, and the crimp and his men found their occupation gone.

That none would commence such a base calling who was not previously a disgraced member of society, may easily be conceived; accordingly, whenever the men were brought up to the India-house for approval, and to enter, as was the case for many years, their conductors, the crimps and their assistants, included in their numerous assemblages a good proportion of street-thieves and receivers of stolen goods. After the ceremony of approval, the men were usually shipped off per Gravesend packet-boats; and, in <date value="1813">1813</date>, being on board one, I recognised the conductor of a very unruly party of these, destined for the Cabalva, who had a notable Babylonish old eschar in his cheek; he turned out to be a j ust-returned lag, whom I had seen holding up his hand at the Old Bailey sessions, some five or six years previously.

Hence the number of Indiamen lost in the very first days of the outward-bound voyage, from the time of the Halsewell, on Purbeck, in <date value="1783">1783</date>, to that of the Britannia and two more, on the Goodwin, in <date value="1807">1807</date>.  But the energy of the officers might have repressed desertions, so fraught with danger at an earlier period, had they pursued the same course as third officer T. Upham, who very properly fired upon the run-aways, and kept the remaining rogues to their duty. </p></div2></div1>

Of these tricks, the most frequent are base attempts to palm off, from house to house, India silk goods, tea, and French manufactures, as smuggled, with Irish-linen and other piece goods; the caitiffs conveying an idea, at times, in an under tone, that sounds as if the goods had been really stolen; whereas, the handkerchiefs were invariably our own countryman ufacture, usually heavy Macclesfields and the broad silks of Spitalfields make.

  <p>Beggars and tinkers are, properly enough, suspected of contributing to burglaries; but then, those people work for themselves, and seldom carry off great amounts. When a large robbery of this kind is contemplated, the rogues employ other agents to examine the premises, to ascertain when the stronger part of the family may be from home; and they cannot better obtain this desirable information than by means of those travelling tradespeople before enumerated. These will annoy the family with

  <p>The perpetrators of house-robberies, not only put in practice the foregoing means of making entry upon premises to rob them, but avail themselves as often of the information to be obtained from servants of every degree, as to what premises are worth entering by force, as also the times when it may be effected with greatest facility and safety, and whereabout the more valuable property is deposited, with other precious particulars, that are sometimes communicated with a guilty participation; at others, not so. When premises have been burglariously robbed, in a surprising manner, or to great amounts, unreflecting people affect to wonder how the entry has been accomplished; simply imagining that the villains may have selected the particular house, on the spur of the moment, after walking about with the implements of house-breaking, crow-bar, jemmy, dark-lantern, skeleton-keys, the means of procuring light, &amp;c. &amp;c. for a day or two, let us suppose: whereas, no conclusion more fallacious any man of sense could ever arrive at, whatever the premises might be whence he drew his deduction. He might as well imagine that body-snatchers, who disturb the mansions of the dead, took their chance of

  <p>But the better to introduce the several points that bear upon the crime of subtracting the property of their employers, by servants and others, we may safely be allowed to look into the morality and private life of the great bulk of Londoners, use our best endeavours to fathom the motives to some nefarious actions, aud to assign causes for others, if not the reasons for their recurrence. After getting over, rather than completing, this rapid excursion, we shall return to the subjects set down at the head of this chapter, and to finish the sketches imperfectly touched upon in the preceding pages.</p>

  <p>Come we next to enter into the privacies of domestic life, where these militate against the comfort or well-being of the heads of families. Of course, the reader will imagine with us, that the master of a family should be an upright person, to say the least of him; moral let him be, and religious, too, if that mode of conducting the duties of social life please him best; but neither the one or the other is indispensable to our present mode of considering the subject in

HAUT TON.</note></p><p> hand, though his mistaken zeal in imposing his own uprightness, his morals, or his religion upon his neighbours, most certainly comes within our purview, if it do not call for reprobation. (ubi, page 7.) Among other subjects fit for the grave consideration of every citizen, one thing is sufficiently clear: if the head of a house be not himself exemplary in his conduct, he may look in vain for regularity among his domestics, deference from his assistants in trade, or due respect from his co-tradesmen and neighbour-gentry. The ban against gross impropriety is raised against their equals in no higher rank in society than those, nor then always, when the transgressors be rich in lucre as they are poor in good works: the haut ton, on the contrary, rather caressing, if they do not patronise deviations from morals in their caste, that do not bring the perpetrators immediately within the provisions of a maledictory statute, or the adverse meaning of common law, if the offence can be commuted with money; because the lower grades cannot follow them thus far, in making pecuniary compensations, that seldom expiate guilt or cause inconvenience to the perpetrators.</p>
  <p>But let the deviations from moral rectitude of a housekeeper be what they may, no reason can be offered why he should be disrobed of his property, by the unlicensed appropriations of servants and making-free inmates; even though he be a thief himself, or more harmfully

Yet do many Christian bodies thus console themselves with carrying on a petty warfare against the goods and chattels of their neighbours, because these may bear a bad character; that is to say, <quote>bad</quote> according to the opinion of the givers. For example, <soCalled>"an old miser"</soCalled> is decried as unworthy the rights of ownership, and from that moment, his property may justly be invaded; the irregular quack is denounced for an impostor, by the regular admissus of the <quote> Guinea-trade;</quote> and the Socinian damned by single authority of the evangelical; thenceforward, the half-honest deem themselves authorised in purloining the stray chattels of the obnoxious party, and the confirmed rogue persuades himself that he merely fulfils a moral duty in enforcing his discomforts. Perhaps 'tis only in fun, that all the

With these, the jocose rogue lights his mother's fire or his own cigar, and, as either smokes heavenward, safely despises the man that nobody speaks well of, principally on account of violent suspicions the robbed person lies under, of being already poor, or otherwise generally obnoxious.</p>
  <p>Servant girls, given to purloining frippery articles from their mistresses, as soon as they get over the self-reproaches of a first essay, stifle all future compunctious visitings, by imagining my lady has more than she deserves, nor can the inquiring Abigail make out by what right her employer possesses so many fine things. Shopmen, with more reason, violently desire to share in the sharp tricks and contri-

</p><p><note place="head">SHOPMEN SEDUCED BY MASTERS;</note></p><p> vances of their masters to cheat the public, in which they have borne a main part, either as to short weight and scanty measure, deterioration of the articles sold, or steady unblushing asseverations that all his <quote>trade-lies</quote> are true as holy writ. And, truly, they have good reason on their side to expect a coparceny with their principals; for, as the noblest females undressed are no longer angels in the sight of their waiting women, any more than a hero is such in the estimation of his valet; neither is the knavish shopkeeper aught but a base knave, according to the best means of judging within the scope of his servants' capacity. Besides, does not the employed run the same risk of detection as his employer, and has he not already incurred the self-accusing obloquy of having acted amiss? What then remains to be done, when his accomplice-master refuses or withholds all participation in the benefits arising from their joint fraudful exertions ?-what, but to help himself ? Not but that the crimes ofservants, with very many shades of guilt, some without one rascally apology, are coming before the public daily, in which not even want is offered in excuse; but generally the extravagance of the accused is found to have actuated him to the perpetration of his first offence, and buoyed up his hopes from that moment to the final upshot of complete detection.  But, however begun, by what means soever continued, that servant, man or woman, who is in the habit of

<pb id="p.215" n="215"/>
  </p><p><note place="head"> THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND PLEASURES.</note></p><p> robbing an employer, is ever the most garrulous, impertinent, or saucy in his particular employ; if with some talent, though that may consist only of conversational elegance becoming his station (vulgo <soCalled>"civil jaw"</soCalled>); or, may be, he is clever in <quote>making sale</quote> of goods, quick as a hawk, sharp as a razor, pugnacious in defence of his master's property, suffering none to rob with impunity, but himself,--still he will be exceeding talkative, accusatory of others, commanding in tone and manner, and if watched, or removed to a department of the concern where he can no longer carry on his operations with impunity, he will kick and fling and threaten to quit, or, if an apprentice, will actually take to his heels and <quote>run away. </quote> If it be a female who is placed under those unhappy circumstances, her running away will occur with some fellow or other; but, of either sex, the fact of secretly robbing may be calculated upon paper, by taking an estimate of the expenses incurred by the suspected person, principally in clothes, sometimes in junkettingparties of pleasure, play goings, chaise driving, horse exercises, and drunkenness.   Much thoughtfulness overspreads the countenance of the private thief, if he be capable of reflection, and has an inclination for reading; if some latent sparks of religious feeling, or compunction, come over his mind, he becomes melancholic or outrageous, according to his temperament. Indeed, persons suffering under secret

</p><p><note place="head"> SERVANTS' PERQUISITES AND PILFERINGS.</note></p><p> troubles of whatever nature, will usually comport themselves after a similar manner. Ill- requited love or misplaced affection, as well as the consciousness of guilt or self-revilings of sinfulness, and the damning proof of exercising a losing trade, or any other viperous entwinement of the soul's best purposes, show their corroding existence by the same line of conduct, that is otherwise inexplicable to the ordinary observer.</p>
  <p>Female servants of every description may fairly be suspected of a desire to appropriate to themselves house-keeping necessaries, though I have chosen to begin with <quote> servant girls ;</quote> for that is the condition in which they themselves begin life, creeping upwards with their years to the higher posts of guiding some particular department of a large household, if they do not entirely control those of less extensive families. Much of this pilfering is considered by them as perquisites, the domestic
<quote>cheeseparings and candles ends</quote> of their offices; and where the establishment is of sufficient munificence, they do not amiss to remove the parings and ends out of sight by any means, when the cheese and the candles come to that pass; but unhappily, they do not always wait until the consummation of the articles desiderated, but often commit acts of violence upon the untouched virgin purity of their employers' property, ere toll has been taken by the right owner. Then again, if the tradesman who supplies those

</p><p><note place="head">SERVANTS TAKE TOLL AND PER CENTAGE.</note></p><p> articles allows the servant (woman or man) a per centage upon the articles supplied, according to the prevalent practice, this excellent mode of making sudden riddance by wholesale cuts both ways, like a two-edged sword. Butlers, cooks, housekeepers of high and distinguished families, take toll of all these tradespeople upon paying their bills, which varies greatly in proportion to the carelessness or supineness of their principals. About ten per cent. satisfies the greater number at their entre upon their offices, respectively; but fifteen per cent. and thence to twenty per cent. is neither an uncommon draw-back, nor undeserved requital for the trouble of recommendation, and the great industry necessary to <quote>make away</quote> with goods sufficient to make it worth while for both parties to do business together. By this species of arrangement, the man-cook, whose stipulated privilege is <quote>to order every thing used in the kitchen,</quote> the butler, who has the like privilege over the drinkables, and the valet de chambre, or own man, who regulates, first, the tailors, and, secondly, the old-clothes-men, with the coachman, who studies horse-flesh and new harness, saddles and carriage-wheels, add to their already well-weighed salaries, incomes of &#x00A3;400, &#x00A3;300, &#x00A3;200, and &#x00A3;100 a-year, according to situation and circumstances, their own consciences or their employers' means, advancement in the state, or increase of estate. For, be it known, whenever a chief justice, or a chan-

All this would be very well, and happens much after the course of all human events, and the due pursuit of trade in a rich commercial metropolis, in particular; but the privilege of perquisites descends to the servants employed by much lower orders in society than <soCalled>"the privileged classes,"</soCalled> the gentry, or even the mere squirearchy of the surrounding districts; and to some who cannot conveniently bear its effects, though they violently desire to maintain their station in society, by means of tolerable equipages supported on economic principles.  In this respect, the example of the haut ton servants is found materially dis-serviceable to the middling classes of gentry, by infusing spendthrift notions, and teaching wayward tricks of raising the ways and means for its support, to the domestics of these latter; which induce these economists to take in dudgeon the coalition of their tradespeople and servants, they look upon the per centage as fraudful, and waste as a crime against the giver of all good; they appeal irascibly to the laws for protection in the punishment of the offenders, and herein seek to avoid the ruin that assuredly follows a lavish expenditure in house-keeping. In this consists
<pb id="p.219" n="219"/>
   </p><p><note place="head">PURLOINING TRADESMEN'S PROPERTY.</note></p><p> the difference between the appropriation and sale of a great man's edible property by his servants, and the remorseless augmentation of his tradebills by adding thereto their privileged per centages, which are both clearly robberies, though seldom punished, because little valued; as are similar subtractions from the property of the middling classes, who are less able to bear these privations, if they do not prove actually ruinous to the sufferers. Hence the asperity with which this class of people pursue purloiners of every description, even although they may not feel the necessity of deterring others by example. Truly enough has it been said: <quote>He who is robbed not knowing what is stolen, he is not robbed at all ;</quote> but, he who is robbed requiring what is lost for his support, why he is robbed indeed.
  Besides all this, the property of a tradesman, and his stock in trade, in particular, lies open to depredation more than the goods and chattels, the cash and valuables of persons not in trade: and what renders this consideration additionally recommendable to notice, the lesser tradesman, shopkeeper, or manufacturer, is more exposed to thefts than the greater ones, by reason of the necessity he is under of exposing his goods to allure customers, which the larger dealer feels unnecessary, or despises, according to the cumbency of his purse, or balance in his bankers' books. The subtraction of a loaf of bread, a lump of bacon, or a scrap of meat from the well-laid-out stall, by the unfed prowler,
<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>
   </p><p><note place="head">SMALL TRADESMEN PILFERED</note></p><p> ought to occasion no evil words between the parties-offender and offended; 'tis the forced tribute which the losers owe to the hungry man, and they even seem to have concurred in it, by laying out an assortment for his choice. In such cases bad betide the man that would attempt to mar the wretch in taking his supper; but the case is altered quite, when the arrant thief employs his art in taking goods of any sort, however exposed at the doors or windows of such minor tradesmen. When the articles stolen may be too bulky for immediate use, or only convertible into money; when they consist of niceties or tit bits, as confectionary or oysters, no good reason can be found for treating the theft as less than felony, or the offender with any less audience than the quarter sessions. I once saw a set of fellows carry off a tub of oysters, from the corner of St. John's Street, facing Smithfield, and afterwards had ocular demonstration that they were all hungry as hounds; but then, the character of the party, the nature of the thing stolen, and its amount, all tended to stamp the deed as one of the worst character. Strangely perverse, or intimidated, the loser declined to follow his tub, as he might have done.</p>
  <p>Retail Shops, that are allowed to continue the only gangway into the dwelling after business hours and of Sundays, are thus exposed to purloinment, and scarcely ever escape. Young folks of either sex, who may have the

         </p><p><note place="head">  BY FEMALE SERVANTS</note></p><p> charge of <quote>answering the door,</quote> or of airing themselves at it of an evening, or on Sundays, usually contract new acquaintances, who naturally admire the articles sold within, and consequently obtain some without purchase. Whatever this may be, the practice is likely to continue and increase, if it does not engender a wish to extend itself to a much more decisive depredation.</p>
  <p>With this end in view, servant women sometimes find themselves addressed by designing knaves, as sweethearts, who carry on the farce of courtship and matrimony-if they do not perpetrate wedlock itself, with the express intention of consummating the more daring crime of burglary-scarcely content with the slow process of privately stealing.</p>
  <p>Warehousemen, as those traders are denominated who sell piece goods, stockings, lace, and the like, leave their premises extremely insecure, in general; the result has been that many of them have found their warehouses completely stripped in the course of one night each. Most of those warehouses that were so entered were parts of large houses, subdivided among several, their owners residing prettily, according to modern custom, at the outskirts of Town, in <quote>country house</quote> lodgings. Opportunity like this ought not to be overlooked by thorough-paced thieves; nor is it. A recent case of two such single-room warehouses in Wood-street being cleared on the same night-

Their mode of operating is no secret:-the thieves, having well ascertained, by previous survey, the habits of the neighbours and persons upon the spot-their uprisings and down lying, the going on and off of the watchmen, together with the mode of fastening the outer door, they then open their way in by skeleton keys, usually on Sunday evenings, previous to the watch going on duty. Being well housed, they procure refreshments and a candle, and amuse themselves with packing up in sacks the whole stock generally, and rest content until morning that the watchmen go off their beats. A coach is then called from the stand, where a <quote>game hackney-man</quote> has previously stationed himself for the purpose; or he drives to a spot hard by, or boldly up to the door of the house, and the job is soon accomplished. On a late occasion, however, in Blackfriars-road, (<date value="1827-August">August, 1827</date>,) the watchman, in his way home to bed, after his dis-

    </p><p><note place="head"> HOW DONE-BLUE CLOTH LIVERIES.</note></p><p> charge, spoiled the sport of a set of those burglars, who had packed up the whole stock of a shoemaker, and the coach drove off towards the bridge as hard as the horses could go, whilst the rogues escaped.  Another shoemaker, at the corner of Oxendon-street, Coventry-street, lost the whole of his stock by similar means, a year before; and, what must have been particularly cruel to the sufferer, we heard, from on dit, that he had robbed himself, the liars.  And in troth, so complete is the clearance, and effected with so much silent celerity withal, that none imagine aught but magic or collusion could have accomplished the ready metamorphosis-especially in those cases where the houses were at all partially inhabited. The same infernal charge as that sustained by the shoemaker, was formerly, i.e. twenty five years since, flung at a silk-mercer, in Paternoster-row, facing of Pannier-alley, whose stock walked off at the same short warning. The house of Mr. Barry, in the Minories, was also inhabited by the family, when all the stock of silk mercery was stolen, about the year <date value="1810">1810</date>.  But the carrying off the whole stock of woollen-drapery goods at the warehouse next to Sambrookcourt, Basinghall-street, was the heaviestjob of its kind that occurs to my recollection at this moment; it was also remarkable for consisting of a great quantity of blue broad-cloths, which gave the thieves an opportunity for dressing themselves in a kind of uniform, viz.-blue

   <p>Porters, carmen, and other underlings, when left to themselves, most frequently find the temptation too great for their moral rectitude, so they should never be relied upon implicitly, without many years of trial, and numerous tests of their honesty. I do not mean that cruel test which some foolish heads of families play off upon their servants, of leaving some glittering article open to purloinment, or pretending to forget to take the key or keys of their money, which they may have previously counted; but the performance of some well specified task, or series of deliveries, afterwards ascertaining that his instructions have been accurately followed, and without equivocation. When it so happens that one of this class of persons is entrusted with the payment or receipt of small sums, and his account of the transactions is enveloped in over much jobation, in assumed stupidity, in impertinent answers, or he drop his money on the ground, shuffle it from pocket to pocket, and otherwise evince confusion of purpose, he has most assuredly been at no good: drunkenness on such an occasion is decisive of his dishonesty; 'tis ever the cloak or the solace of his misdeeds.</p>

He was, likewise, exemplary in the fulfilment of his religious duties, confessing often, and going to mass regularly; so were the knot of Porters, who had a depot of almost every article of commerce, in Handcourt, Thames-street, that proved they practised exchanges of goods with many persons more than their own acknowledged number,
(nine of them,) who were never brought to justice. They lived expensively, were remarkable for wearing top-boots-one of them being a leather thief, at Curtis's, in Well-street, Cripplegate-and the Irishman just named being further notorious for the sugar-candy accompaniment that always attended his every footstep in his Sunday visits to chapel, and in his rounds to those numerous customers whom he supplied withstolen goods. The Hand-court people were also exemplarily strict in their religious observances: by the way, this species of cloak for their misdeeds is not a deception confined to London and its environs; for I find, at the moment of this sheet going to press, that a father and two sons, (Heyworth by name,) j ust now executed in Lancashire, for numerous foot-pad rob-

With the like claims to uncommon sanctity, a millwright, in good employ for many years, in the neighbourhood of Wells, in Somersetshire, is ascertained to have committed burglaries out of number, including sacrilege, with grand larceny, and he finally attempted murder: he remains for trial.</p>
  <p>This class of depredators upon the property of their employers are numerous beyond conception, generally much emboldened by long impunity, and some of them contrive to amass property enough to enter upon business on their own account, in a manner very edifying to the close observer of passing events. If they oppose their old employers in trade, and by their continued machinations, complete the ruin they began, we clearly perceive the task is incomplete, until they have also blackened the character of him they once served out, in order that his enemies may fix on some certain cause for his losses, and not join his friends in perversely attributing his ruin to the dishonesty of servants. These are no idle speculations: I have proved the facts in all their bearings; and could put my hand upon forty living instances, at any time; some in two's and three's, who have thus battened under the same roof.</p>

Forgiveness, however, or lenity, as we call it when the investigation has been submitted to a jury, is often thrown away upon the individual, and always operates to the disadvantage of the grantor himself. Some years ago, early in the morning, I noticed a fellow take an armfull of books, from the shelves of his employer, in Stationers' Court, and followed him to a pawnbroker's, in Brydges-street; but although he was found to have practised the same kind of robbery to a good extent, yet the master thought proper to relent, and the offender went at large. By way of requital, the culprit stigmatised his master's character, and shortly afterwards informed against him, upon some penal statute, whereby he pocketed a portion of the fines. In the year <date value="1826">1826</date>, one Dunn, a confidential clerk, or assistant, to certain silk mercers, in Compton-street, Soho, was condemned to death for privately robbing his employers of goods in a large amount; but, as

  <p>Burglaries from without may be prevented, by demonstrations of vigilance and of unceasing watchfulness, whatever the real fact may be. For a lone house, the bare exhibition of a musket near a window, always effects some good; firing it off, nightly, much more. If the inmates have the character of being sportsmen, and good shot, this sort of proficiency offers no encouragement to any neighbourly inquiring burglar; for no burglary of any extent, is undertaken, as I remarked higher up (page 222), unless the party has previously reconnoitred the premises, and made some inquiries as to the number, quality, and habitudes of the people within. If the females can be brought to fire off small pistol-charges, the achievement of so much, or a little more, would add greatly to the security of the mansion, when the men might be abroad, asleep, or youthful and spiritless. A yard dog is indispensable to such an appurtenance; but

His ferocity may be augmented by frequent alarms at night, by feeding him on raw meat and horseflesh, by mounting a bug-a-boo on the wall or railing, and ringing the alarum-bell. In neighbourhoods much infested with burglars, the employment of a large bell, in front of the house, is found signally serviceable in the repression of these, and of thieves of every denomination: its sound might be rendered familiar to all the neighbourhood within hearing; and these three defences may be brought to act in unison-the bell, the fire-arms, and the dog, by all three being set at the same time, every evening; the dog being called upon, as soon as the piece has been fired, the bell struck once or twice, and the animal set loose from his chain, to <q type="spoken">"mark, now, Cato ! mind them, the rascals !"</q></p>
  <p>Not only at the outskirts of our bills of mortality are those night defences of property and of life thus rendered efficacious, but in the more popular streets also, where neighbouring premises jostle and intersect each other in front, and flanks, and rear. In such cases, a small dog that will yapp a good deal, and can get away underneath furniture &amp;c. is goodly desirable for alarming the inmates and bothering the thieves into a precipitate retreat; more especially if wire-communications be extended from

With precautions such as these, or compounded out of them, has the writer of this article, for many years lived in the very disturbed district about Hackney-road and Hoxton, unmolested on his premises, though these are perilously situate in view of the West front of Haggerstone-church, some 400 yards off; and has even retired to rest in the middle of this winter,

  <p>Of Duffers, I have recent cause to entertain a very disadvantageous opinion--not so much on account of their ferocious aspects, revolting manners, and the brutal life-contests in vogue at their native villages-as the total want of moral restraint exhibited in those cases where any have been implicated; and if they are very seldom discovered to have been either

But duffy was not to be denied; he pressed still stronger, and with such warm asseveration to the truth of his real India, that Mr. Halberd accompanied him to his receptacle in a neighbouring public-house, where he found one piece that was indeed real India, bargained for and bought it, amidst continued attempts to shuffle it between others, for the purpose of  <quote>ringing the changes,</quote> as they term the nefarious act; then, having dashed down the money demanded with one hand, and seized the right piece of goods with the other, he made for the door with his prize, exulting no doubt over the duper duped. At this moment, another duffer, as genteel to look at as he was rough in tacto, ready at villainy and athletic in person, insisted that the identical muslin our friend had bought was his by previous purchase, and proceeded to assert the rights of ownership by violent seizure <quote><foreign lang="FR">vi et armis.</foreign></quote> Thus the question became quite <quote>another man's matter, </quote> the first duffer assuming the character of a candid moderator, and <quote>allowing that the</quote>

Astley Cooper never performed a successful operation in less time than our Halberd reduced this rank and file to a state of compound fracture, and left them to compose their affairs in the best manner they could. But his back was no sooner turned than the rogues turned the affair to good account amongst the people of the house, asserting that they had been seized upon by an officer of the revenue, and must sell the remainder of their smuggled importation in much haste. This they not only did, but day after day people flocked to Duke's Court to purchase <quote>pieces of the real India from the gentlemen who had been so scandalously treated by the Excisemen,</quote> as they observed. But the key to this piece of fatuity is found in the fact, that the people of Cockaigne <quote>love to be in a secret,</quote> to their very hearts; and whilst they meet to petition for acts of parliament, acts of common-council, and to make bye-laws and imposts to coerce their neighbours, themselves endeavour to break through loop-holes, and evade every act that is passed.</p>

  <p>Although not quite so noxious as many queer classes in society, who surreptitiously endeavour to come at the contents of others' pockets, the everlasting wagerers whom we have denominated kiddies, from carrying their heads, or their hats, or both awry, when in full operation, are nevertheless equally troublesome and annoying to those, who having cash or credit, would preserve both from being impaired, when compelled by business or drawn by pleasure to mix in general companies.</p>
  <p>The consideration of this subject, and the exposition of the whole class, will naturally lead

</p><p><note place="head"> WAGERING, PERVADES ALL CLASSES.</note></p><p> to some inquiries concerning the better-defined gamblers of whom they are imitators, followers, or apes. Conjoined, they constitute a great portion of the population, the sums they wield are immense, and their speculations often lead to the ruin of many. But, unlike the well-marked gamblers, our mere wagering kiddies scarcely leave to the objects of their choice the option of closing with their propositions, or of declining them. Like flies, they pitch upon every subject, alight upon every topic of discourse, blight every inquiry, are of all sizes, infest every part of town, and buz or bite, according to their capacity of infliction, at every in-door assemblage. Persons prone to laying of wagers pervade every class of society, nearly, including alike those who have no money to lose nor credit to stake in its stead, as well as they to whom addition can be no object, increase bring no new comfort, nor depletion weaken, to whom satiety has administered its full draught, and left nothing to hope for of this world's goods. No matter his station in life, whether he lay a thousand to fifty on the Derby, repeating the same daily, or demands, frequently,
"which will you have for the Leger ?" or, not more simply, bet <q type="spoken">" you don't know how many sixes makes a dozen, for a bob-there now,"</q> all are equally wagering kiddies.</p>

Vulgar proposal, that is characteristic of the northerns and the Welsh in London; it even enters the shop and counting-house, and is sometimes emitted from the psalm-singing trachea and female lips. What will the reader think of the newmarried wife of our friend, (who has written several pages of the present volume,) the day after their nuptials, exclaiming <q type="spoken">"my dear B-k, I'll bet ye a guinea it rains to day !"</q> and this, too, in the teeth of a well-planned excursion ! Though naive in the extreme, and perfectly confidential, it was so completely characteristic of the county (York), that it left an impression thirty years have failed to erase.</p>
  <p>At those several places that are distinctly set apart for the purpose of laying wagers, the case is very different; there, where their whole object is clearly understood to be an adventurous speculation, that admits of no other periphrasis than one would define as the fit arena for speculatingin well-calculated chancesof hazard, risk, or odds, against any coming event, whether that be a horse-race, a ship's arrival, a manfight, or a wrestling match, we expect no other conduct. At Lloyd's Coffee-house, for example, the members will take ten to eight that a prince
<quote>survives a week from the date of the slip,</quote> and the next moment offer eight to ten on the contrary; thus pocketting a safe twenty per cent. upon the double transaction, and obliging two parties oppositely interested in the fate of the

The word <quote>obliging</quote> is the wrong word, I fancy, as applied to any member of Lloyd's, whilst on its boards; for at that house of adventurers they think of nothing less than obliging any one living, and a co- member even less than that; nay, according to the language of the house, 'tis seven to five they would prefer obliging him over the left. The members do not stop here, nor with the shipping interest, in their gambling speculation: scarcely any event that can happen of a political or fiscal nature but is here, at some time or other, the subject of betting to large amounts. A declaration of war, the amount of hop-duty for the current year, quantity of loan required, or the amount of Exchequer-bills; who will be returned for the City M. P.'s, or whether Sheen will suffer for murdering his child, are all alike considered legitimate subjects of betting at this centre and touchstone of the commerce of the world. Then, in what, or how much does this house differ from the <quote>betting room</quote> at Tattersals'; there, where they extend their speculations to little else than running-horses, with the usual adjunct sports, of fighting-cocks and the manful contests of the prize-ring?

<quote>the toss up of a halfpenny</quote> is perfect chancemedley, and <quote>heads or tails</quote> not to be controlled by the juggling tricks of black legs. But, since precaution has been rung to some purpose in the ears of our youth, who would see <hi rend="cl">LIFE</hi>, as regards gamblers' tricks and wiles, scarcely any stray single gentleman will take a hand at cards with strangers at late hours nor in flash parlours, much less in confessedly <quote>flash-houses,</quote> where flash-men to flash-whores flash their money, whilst they talk flash, and flashily do all they come near, and some times each other: even the landlords of the flash-houses, who will come in with a bet now and then, in order to bear up the person to be done, do not always get back the money so staked, and purposely lost, and much oftener get done out of their reg'lars, or share in the booty obtained of the novice. 'Tis no better if they employ a known seedy cove to stake for them, when the house may be full of flash, nor yet when they lend a prime gaffer money to begin the play. This, however, happens seldom; but when it does, a row takes place, and the gaffer (the treble rogue!) splits upon the misdoings, late hours, and strong liquors, served by the flash coffee-shop-man, if he does not stand fight, and go before the grand jury with a bill of indictment; who would do well to form an estimate of the cre-

 the city, I know of but one such public-house,
 where gaffing is carried on to any amount, or
 is pressed upon the visitors, for we here speak
 of no other, and that is at Moorgate.</p>
   <p>And, tospeak truly, the gaffing, though heavy, is carried on at this latter place with more appearance of fairness, as between party and party, than at the similar places in Westminster, just alluded to, viz. Benchester's, Bensols, the Grapes and Black Boy. At the house first- mentioned, a number of pieces are played with, say six, of all sizes, and if the person calling for <quote>man</quote> or <quote>woman,</quote> is not right or wrong at five pieces, neither of the gaffers win or lose, but go again. At the West-end, au contraire, one piece only is supposed to be used, though the most expert leg-gaffer employs one that has two heads, and another with two tails,<note place="foot" n="1">So managed, by rubbing down one side each of two pieces, to half the thickness, (or less) of either, and joining them together again, secundum artem, which may be done without soldering.</note> sometimes throwing up one, and catching it with both hands, when

Upon the adversary calling for head, let us suppose, the leg presses the ball of his finger upon the head-piece, and gives it a jerk into his coat-sleeve, which lies flat on the table to receive it; then dropping his arm, the piece of money falls into his hand for a fresh put down, or to make his call in turn. Sometimes the piece to be taken up, or got rid of, lies under the palm of the thief's hand: he then contrives to squeeze his hand so hard upon the coin, that its inequalities press into the moist cuticle, by which means he lifts it from the table, and clasps it with his thieving irons.</p>
  <p>Large sums, for such a game, occasionally change hands at the places indicated; ten pounds being no uncommon stake, and when the gaffer is sure of having his piece all correct, he waits and talks, ere he draws up his hand,
(always with an air, or jerk,) after betting with all who will take, and doubling or trebling with the principal dupe: by these means, we have seen fifty pounds lost upon a single toss, or put down, and have heard of still larger stakes, that were decided in the same manner at the upper-house, in James-street. At this place, the most obnoxious gaffer, for some years, has been long Jerry, (the son of a respectable leather-man, in Oxford-street,) whom the three authors of Egan's <quote>Life-in-London</quote> thought proper to make the hero of their tale, at first, but were obliged to abandon him after their

  <p>Before we entirely quit the wagering kiddies and their practices, the reader would desire, probably, to come at a criterion for judging of both, and to know when and how it is they come forth of their chrysalis state, to become gamblers prepense, or finished legs.  Whilst I was a citizen of London City, I was equally disposed with my neighbours to look over the conduct of others with an easy glance, and  kind indulgence at their failings, provided these interfered nought with the comforts of others, nor attempted the coercion of thought or action. This state of the mind our citizens owe to a greasy atmosphere, fat- enveloped spleen, and general repose of the corporeal system. Hence it was, that, regarding the kiddies of our wagering genus without prejudice, though I could not deny that the practice of laying bets was but so many varied mean attempts to come at the money of others by undue, though excusable means, yet I dressed up my opinion of their motives for laying wagers, and the means of getting off, in the aphoristic form as follows, by way of rebuke.</p><p>
  <list type="numbered"><item n="1">A wager well laid is already half won.</item>

Some of these last mentioned tricksters I have taken occasion to denounce and expose by name, elsewhere: they reform, I am told, or at least shrink from our ken, and I may, for this once, be excused from repeating the blow. They appear no more on the turf, or in the ring; and I ask for credence without further proof than my own assertion is worth, and this, I take it, goes as far as any man's, in all such affairs at least.</p>

  <p>For a great number of years that a friend of mine frequented the respectable companies of tradesmen meeting at the taverns in and about Covent-garden, he was greatly amused with the daily and nightly struggles there exhibited to take money out of each others' pockets, by means of tricky wagers.

  <p>His companion had indeed been that foreman, and had given the verdict in a most peculiar manner on the occasion, but whether with any design upon the gentlemen of that room, is too much to say.  Some of them called it <soCalled>" a do,"</soCalled> and nothing better; whilst a broad-faced north countryman, rather lame of a foot, with snuffling speech, as if he had caught a cold in the Park, wanted to prove, (through his nose,) metaphysically, that the thing was impossible.

And so are all wagers that may be pressed upon any one regarding play, or the events of the turf, that may be coming off; the more general of which are the Derby, Oaks, and Leger-trotting matches, foot-races, and man-fights, many of which are knocked up with the previous knowledge which is to win. Without this guilty pre-knowledge, no doubt exists but that gentlemen  may sport their money innocently enough; and so may every other class, order, and genus of society, without either being justly chargeable with more wickedness therefore; since it is to those sports we denominate athletic, that Britain owes her pre-eminence over the nations that hate her institutions, and fear her power, if they do not wonder in astonishment at her domestic feats just enumerated-- to which I will add, without permission, both cudgelling and wrestling. But, when the general predilection for those sports, or any others less conducive to the national glory, is made the handle to help themselves nefariously to the property of honest people, by sets of sharpers, cheats, and swindlers, we know not in what terms sufficiently to reprobate the acts and those engaged in them, as tending to bring odium on those truly British games; to say nothing of the money thus dishonestly subtracted by the kiddies,

  <p>Of the great horse-race stakes, just mentioned, it may truly be averred that no man yet born ever had previous knowledge which horse would win, even soon after <soCalled>"the start;"</soCalled> whence we may safely infer he never will possess that guilty knowledge. Neither can he tell to a certainty which horses will start, even up to the week of running, as any horse may fall lame, die, or change owners in the meantime; but, whenever great sums are laid upon any given horse, pro and con, so many personsjockies, owners, and wagering kiddies, are interested in his defeat, that they join, though they may not conspire, in measures to <quote>shut him out,</quote> or prevent his winning.

  <p>In fact, these latter are commonly concocted in town, and <quote>come off</quote> in the country, similar to the races of the four-legged animals; therefore, as illustrative of all the rest, we will let out some particulars of a cross match footrace run in the spring of <date value="1827">1827</date>, at Doncaster, between Captain Barker and Calfmeat, for an alleged large sum.

He was not known, however, at Doncaster, so he was industriously puffed off, as capital, and odds on him offered, at the very commencement, by some of the knowing ones, and accepted to large nominal amounts by others of the same party. In the midst of large companies there, and in London, the foot race was hourly broached by them; it occupied everybody's attention, and large sums were ostentatiously placed in the hands of third persons for security sake, but in reality to gammon the flats. These manoeuvres succeeded: the Captain (whom none knew to be

The racers started, the Captain lost to a nicety, Calfmeat's backers received the stakes, if he really had any besides the London party; and these, upon making up their receipts and payments, found a balance of

  <p>At the settlement and division of the spoil. a boggle arose, which threatened a bubbery and split; and this was the manner in which the facts came out: Priestby had started a sum off to London, before the hour of settling came, and the Bronteman could no otherwise obtain his share of the plunder (some seven or eight hundred pounds) than by taking paper from Priestby, i. e. stiff, in the form of <q type="spoken">"I promise to pay,"</q>-a promise he has not kept to this day.   * *  * * *  * *  *

The bare flinging a lignum vitae ball of ten or fourteen pounds, upwards of twenty feet, is no child's play. In summer time, many hundreds, on Saint Mondays, thousands of mechanics and others are found playing at those games; mostly at the outskirts of town, though the sport is evidently better adapted to winter use, when

                 Metropolis</head>
 
  <p>BY metropolis we would be understood as speaking, not only of the City of London proper, which gives the popular name to a large district around it, but of the City of Westminster and Borough of Southwark also. Some persons, faunists and foreigners by birth, choose to contemn the inhabitants of this first of all cities in every respect, by terming them cockneys, and the district they occupy <quote> Cockneyshire, </quote> or, with more elegance, <quote>Cockaigne.</quote> But say what they like, let us expose as we may the weaknesses, the frailties, and even the crimes of Cockaigne, the triple compound just sketched contains a greater aggregate of talent, of trading honour and generosity, than any other city of ancient or modern times. Other cities may have been more populous, or more securely fortified; Delhi and Babylon, what were they ? Paris and St. Petersburgh, of what do they boast, that in London we cannot find an over match in kind? Happiness, comfort, health, ease, and progressive improvement, are perceptile every where, in the faces, the houses, the manufactories, the domestic arrangements of the major part of twelve hundred thousand persons; though we must make large deductions for

<pb id="p.265" n="265"/>
      </p><p><note place="head">ASSOCIATING PRINCIPLE, STRONG.</note></p><p> casualties, and the usual drawbacks to which individuals occasionally subject themselves, or are reduced by the improvidence, the chicane or dishonesty of others, as much as by age, accident, or other uncontrollable events.</p>
  <p>In the foregoing pages, we have necessarily performed the most ungracious part of our task first, by exhibiting the roguish part of the population, in nearly all their varied hues; interspersing the whole with short traits of character, real anecdote, facts and cases, that illustrate the actions, motives, casual lapses and errors, into which a vast portion have been led, or are likely to fall. This was the butt, the end and aim of the book, originally; but the employment would have afforded no satisfaction, if ultimate benefit were not likely to result from so much labour, to say nothing of the peril some of the personal occurrences involved; whilst the melancholy reflections all this waywardness must give rise to, are occasionally broken by an excursus now and then among mistaken individuals of the better orders of society. Notwithstanding the long catalogue of actual crime which we have thus set forth in full array, the bulk of settled Londoners our stranger is likely to come in contact with, will be found less active in their individual pursuits, of whatever nature these may be, and not anywise remarkable for evil doing; though superlatively animated when assembling for general purposes, as the carrying an election of any sort,

<pb id="p.266" n="266"/>
 </p><p><note place="head">STATE OF EXCITEMENT-ELECTIONEERING.</note></p><p> to promote benevolence, or to oppose a bad ministry and its mistaken measures. Indeed, a free people, to be estimated rightly as to manners, must be judged of undertheir highest state of excitement; at which these arrive when exercising the elective franchise, and imagine they are making law makers, who will look after their pecuniary interests, and coerce the evil disposed by statutes, which the elect soon afterwards manufacture under our noses in frightful numbers. Whatever the bulk of the people may be found in any of the provincial cities, under similar circumstances, the population of London, of Westminster, of Middlesex and Southwark, is respectively in a superior degree; or, say baser, if the purpose be a bad one, as rioting, or the attempts of a mobocracy to rule the roost; with the exception that, in the Metropolis, more money is spent, or subscribed, to support a cause, and that scarcely any man or party can attempt to bear the sway, without raising up a strong opposing party, which is very likely to expose and overturn his best contrived plans of ambition. Although in practice several of her internal representatives cringe to the powers that be, and bow the head to Baal lowest when he appears in his worst attribute, yet is London City far from being Tory in principle. This I apprehend is a necessary consequence of the land-holders crippling commerce by their absurd tenacity of high average corn laws, and equally ridiculous as cruel game

On the other hand, Westminster is devoted to parliamentary reform, individually and collectively, the electors mis-taking this to be the panacea for all complaints; whilst the Borough of Southwark is radical, and tax- opposing, to the extreme of ridiculousness; and its better chastened counter part, the county of Surrey, lately proved, that she would no longer submit to the arrogant inefficiency of Holme Sumner and his high-sounding abettors of the squirearchy.</p>
  <p>The habits of the people are gregarious to a fault, accompanied by conviviality and unrestrained manners; the younger folks, rising branches of improving mercantile houses, carrying these qualities to the extreme in many instances; when that happens which always takes place in similar cases-they fly off in a tangent, and are lost to their sphere. Among the middle walks of life, which may comprise about three-fifths of the whole resident population, who are easy in circumstances, and bland in their manners, the minor moral aberrations of their neighbours, their means of doing business, mode of managing a family, or extent of establishment-all which give cause for so many heart- burnings and prying investigations in
<pb id="p.268" n="268"/>
</p><p><note place="head"> FICTITIOUS SOCIETY, AND THE SERIOUS.</note></p><p> little towns and dull cities, here occasion no unneighbourly uneasiness, no unchristian surmises, nor any of those base suggestions of reform as are met with to perfection in Calvinistic society; unless, indeed, the transgressors publish their misdeeds to the world, or render their doings offensive to mankind. Of the remaining two-fifths, one may belong almost entirely to the fictitious part of society, if that term can be used of persons who avoid generalising their intercourse, and are better studied in the fashionable novels that issue incontinently from the Burlington press of our ancient acquaintance, Mr. Henry Colburn,or from Messrs. Saunders and Ottley, hard by.</p>
  <p>The remainingfifth of our population, leaving out of consideration all hospitals and other secluded places, consists of that link in society which denominate themselves the serious part of it. As in all other parts of the world, the more violent sects seek proselytes with most fervency, and attract together the greatest congregations of gaping ignorance, whom they fleece and cajole under various pretexts; whilst the modest Quaker, the unassuming Unitarian, the jaded Romanist, and the otherwise garrulous Jew, are content to wend their way, unseeing and unseen of controversialist or polemic.</p>
   <p>Trade has been considered the main characteristic of the people of this immense metropolis, as it is in a less degree that of the whole na-

Within our cockney district, not only those professedly engaged in commerce seek after profit, by bartering one commodity for anothergenerallyfor money, or its representative paper, but the desire of gain pervades all classes and all ages, more universally than is perceptible in any other city of the empire. Every thing in London has its price, and every man and woman, too: virtue, honour, and honesty are marketable commodities; enjoyments may be purchased and happiness secured thereby, abstract from reflection; even love and affection are often swerved from their purpose, or fixed upon unworthy objects, by dint of lucre that is applied with malign judgment to purchase thoughtless pleasures.  Religionists expend vast sums in procuring converts to their respective sects; so that faith is thus sacrificed at the shrine of good works, contrary to the rule they teach to lapsed conscious sinners; whilst the man of worth-being reduced, may carry his sorrows to market, and the widow dry her tears in the lap of benevolence.</p>
  <p>Lay sectarians in good numbers speculate upon chapel-building, and the price paid for seats, according to the attractions of their cushion-thumper; whilst several undertake parish offices, or become tax-gatherers, and one or two, incongruously enough, accept the post of churchwardens: at Christ-church, one of them  lately repaired the parish church throughout, at a cheap rate, and a very sanc-

  <p>The spirit of Trade infuses itself into every transaction of life; or what is the same thing, every affair in which the citizehs of our tripolitan Town may engage, receives the tincture, the smack of trade in no trivial degree. Does one with his face towards Change meet another who has turned his back upon it, with a compliment, the latter replies, <q type="spoken">"seven-eighths, buyers,"</q> or,

  <p>Eating and drinking, in fact, are occupations in modern London that are undertaken, less with a view to appeasing the calls of nature, than to overpower her, and in frequent instances, absolutely kill her with kindness. After one of their great city gorge-matches, in which they vie with each other who shall swallow the largest quantities of viands, of flummeries, our citizens may be discovered in their recesses as immobile as the wolverene after a buffalo feast, incapable of <quote>doing business </quote> satisfactorily, yet unwilling to <q type="spoken">"give in,"</q> though almost ready to cry out, with Frank in the play, <q type="spoken">" sink the shop, and I'll give ye a hundred."</q> Then it is they justly incur the rebuke of greasy citizenship; then are they most liable to be captivated with extravagant schemes for making money without trouble, to enter into joint stock speculations, and commit those fitful acts of supererogative generosity which at times <quote> astonish Europe,</quote> and raise the smile of those who stand aloof, or have retired from the smoke and the vapour of the subscriptions, <quote>to rusticate afar, the fields among.</quote> The love of good living and jollity extends thither also, at times, and always pervades the

If the Speaker of the House of Lords hold his state dinners, and he of the other house invite contending parties to his periodical feasts, to hobor-nob each other, and evince a disinterestedness they cannot feel; so do every class of society gormandise their friends to extreme obesity, or endeavour to pacify their opponents with stimulative draughts, that give vent to the worst passions of our nature, after having exhausted the more social qualities of the

The people of England are decidedly clubists; those of London eminently so; for, whereas, in provincial places, all society is more contracted, the independent and enlightened population of London, feeling less restraint, give free vent to their thoughts, their fancies and vagaries, insomuch that we sometimes find the wholly convivial clubists swerving a little from the right rule in their night rambles. The rise and progress of clubism, the spirit and purposes to which these are applied, the use which has been made of clubs as a political engine, and for electioneering purposes-would form a subject worthy the investigation of the curious and the enlightened inquirer. Some one has recently made <quote>the clubs of London</quote> the matter of a large separate history ; but this work is too expanded in personals, for the general reader: the like task was performed recently for a single club, <quote><orgName key="the Kit Cat,">the Kit Cat,</orgName></quote> which makes a figure in English story, as being mainly instrumental in bringing about the Hanover succession.

Next in age is the Beef-steak-club meeting, every Saturday at the English Opera-house, the resort of wits for the lastfour-score years; then there was <quote>the Dirty-shirt-club,</quote> that implied a certain carelessness of dress, quite compatible with sterling wit; next, the Coal-hole meetings vied with the latter in its designation, and we are told that Doctor Samuel Johnson was a frequenter of both, as well as <quote>the Literaryclub,</quote> and his own coterie at the Mitre, constantly. That truly great man had the full relish for clubism, and did not escape the rebukes of his serious friends for his convivial attachments: to one of those starched moralits, he replied,
<q type="spoken">" Sir, the great chair of a full and pleasant club is the throne of human felicity."</q>
  The doctor did not confine his ideas to clubs of wits, but must have witnessed the use that was made of them in propagating opinions of men and measures. We have proved how these, broached at one or two, fly like wildfire round the entire series of all descriptions of such assemblages, many persons being members of several, and some men visiting two or three of an evening, particularly when they have aught to propagate.

  <p>And Mr. Burke was right in this, as he was in most other matters to which he brought his great mind to fix all its attention; and he had, probably, in his sojournment among the spirits he spoke of, ample means of seeing the force he alludes to put in motion. In case of any great political struggle, a petition to parliament, or to nominate a new candidate, for example, the clubs and societies are all put in motion; certain active promoters of the proposed measure go round to various societies, or frequenters of some given places, where sits the presiding genius of the party, and the affair is opened up and discussed, without parade or formality; everyone is led, not directed or called upon, to consider the subject, and each individual, desiring not to shine less than others, he concurs in the measures, and promotes the views of the prime movers.</p>

This taste for acquisition by reading, it must be confessed, began with the second rate persons of each department first, and extended itself upwards to the already fortunate traders, who were thus compelled to study somewhat intensely, or to resign the vantage ground to the new comers. From thirty years ago, to a dozen years since, the struggle was very great between them; the sale of books of every description immense,

I have reason to believe they were favourably received, and the suggestions therein contained thought worthy of consideration by those of whom it is an honour to be esteemed. They were chiefly directed towards the repression of crime, to the speedy detection of offenders, on which the first greatly depends, and the concentration of police information; but I have to lament, that these points are still imperfectly understood, and require fresh arguments or reiteration of the old ones: I have also some personal explanations to give, which I hope may induce a more general gratuitous aid of the persons employed and paid, than some folks think themselves bound to afford, or find it convenient to bestow.</p>

   <p>Police, or the right government and controul of the worst elements of a population, at once dense and evil disposed, is not a matter likely to attract the regard of people in trade, much less those of retired habits; whilst independent gentlemen living at their ease, those of the professions, and even such as possess true energy of character and the wish to evince themselves
 good citizens, shrink from the danger of close
 personal examination, if they do not imagine
 reputation may be compromised in the attempt
 to obtain the information necessary to a right

<pb id="p.280" n="280"/>
 </p><p><note place="head">POLICE, WHAT. THIEVES THREATEN.</note></p><p> having undertaken to submit to public inspection my observations on this topic, I did so anonymously.  Personal danger, it is upon record, could not deter me; so I conclude, that I then thought of some connection or other, that actuates me no longer. In one case, I employed the name of another man instead of my own, and wrote down to his capacity, or copied his words to preserve the unity of the deceit; in another I was <soCalled>"A Constant Reader,"</soCalled> and the following was my apology for troubling the public at that time, (i. e. 1817) as it shall be at this:--<quote> Previously to entering fully upon the subject [of police] I may, properly enough, state to you, that my familiar acquaintance with the faces of rogues of various hue, and many of their practices, arise from living in so public a situation as this is [nigh St. Paul's], as well as the accidental circumstance of having taken a daring robber fifteen years before [mentioned, at page 82,] besides three minor offenders, latterly. Ever since that time, I have not ceased to give some attention to depredators of all descriptions, I mean their persons and practices, their combinations, and the means employed for their detection; for this good reason,
(at first,) that I refused the friends of the culprit alluded to my interference for lessening his punishment (as my neighbour had done) since I found upon inquiry at Bethnal-green, where he belonged, that they were all thieves alike. Whereupon, I heard a distinct threat, so very</quote>

</p><p><note place="head">  INFORMATION, HOW OBTAINED. PERIL.</note></p><p><quote>  intelligible, that for more than three years I found it requisite to walk circumspectly by day, rapid or armed by night. Whenever I perceived any of them about, I screwed myself up to the pitch of a stout repulse, and uncharitably set down in my mind all those for rogues whom I saw in the same company,-and then again, all that I might afterwards see in the company of these latter;</quote> and so onwards I continue to the present day. In those conclusions, however hastily formed, I was subsequently borne out by some very painful results befalling the parties. Vide my first letter.</p>
  <p>When the string of villains just alluded to had passed away, my circumspection might have gone to rest; vigilance may go sleep when no longer excited by apprehension. Not so, however, in this case: what had commenced in caution, I might say, now devolved into habitual curiosity, if it were not patriotism or the love of order; and I found several occasions and various, when my advice and manual help became practicably available; whilst a cry of <q type="spoken"> Stop thief!</q> roused my dormant energies,
-as that of <q type="spoken"> Fire !</q> would those of an old Bridewell-boy, and nearly as often threw me into the head of the chase, by dint of pace or force of stratagem. Atlength, in myfirst letter, I was <quote>free to confess that my taste for this <quote> stopping</quote> and stagging, or looking on, underwent partial abatement, by reason of certain odd punctures and hard bruises I received</quote>

According to my custom, he was delivered into the custody of a constable, who received the usual panegyrics on his diligence, activity, &amp;c. without blushing. Thus, I may say, I sought for information on these subjects with many advantages, having full as much zeal as the paid people, who are all too well known, most assuredly with perfect independence, sometimes at some expense, and always with commensurate success. At a later period, I managed to be present at conferences they could never hear of, but at polluted second hand.

I one winter belonged to such a party, at Lower Islington, where our gardens were nightly robbed of wet clothes, &amp;c. and the perpetrators were soon ascertained to consist of two only. On the signal for chase, I ran after and overtook one in front of the Britannia (Brindley's), and the other fell at the starvation-farm-pond. One of our maxims was to look after the watchmen and patrol, and keep them to their duty; and to this end two or three sallied out in turn, whilst the body smoked their pipes awaiting any alarm. The first description of night-guardians are generally liable to suspicion; but of the second, I recollect but one distinct charge of malversation in his office, and that so absurdly peculative, that I contrived to send him before his betters at Hatton-garden, Mr. Laing and Mr. Rogers, with his peepers in mourning, (<date value="1822-April">April,
1822</date>,) as the most appropriate treatment for extorting douceurs from publicans for keeping alleged late hours. His brother-officer, upon occasion of that appearance, we had already ascertained to be corruptly connected with thieves; he having stashed one robbery for fifty pounds of the booty; and, in another

  <p>Both those thieves were, subsequently, transported-as I believe, but not until their long, unbroken career had incited others, hitherto innocent, to join the nefarious gang. I had already remarked, on similar transactions,
[Letter I.] <quote> It is the dispensing power thus left in the hands of officers which ripens crime and produces the greatest number of capital offences.</quote>  Both instances of stashing were well known to all the gang, whereby it literally encouraged crime; as we afterwards ascertained, that three or four unemployed youths of decent parentage, were enticed away by the impunity thus purchased, and long time enjoyed, by their companions. All were ultimately punished, but the process occupied too much time to operate exemplarily on others.</p>
  <p>Had the two hacknied thieves whose robberies were so compromised by the unfaithful officer then received the punishment due to their crimes, and that speedily, the new ones could have had no such inducement to become dishonest, they would rather have been scared from their purpose at the outset of their career. In proof of this proposition, I may adduce the

Without circumlocution then, (I concluded in my first letter) the nosing must be taken out of the hands of those officers, and that immediately; or, the same end would be answered by ordering, that the clerk to a policeofficer do take down in secret the daily progress of any negotiation carried on with accomplices or spies; any deviation from a full and fair disclosure, or misinformation, to be visited with prompt und unsparing rigour.</quote> In my second letter I suggested, that the remedy for this discrepancy in the operations of the police, would

It is a real piece of humbug, to talk of the efficacy of a moving well-marked body, that covers no more than three feet square at any time. Whereas, the greatest efficacy would be found in their slily pouncing upon the congregated rogues, and locking some of them up ; if they are a young set, as usually happens, with some two or three who have already suffered imprisonment, and they assemble often, a good stick-flogging for the former would be quite appropriate and happy in its effects, especially when coupled with the summary imprisonment of the ring-leaders.</p>
  <p>As at present managed, the police are wholly useless in repressing the nurseries of crime I allude to, where youths out of place, idly inclined, or accidentally, first get acquainted with older persons of depraved character. They are as little efficient in breaking asunder the disgraceful connection, when the parties adjourn from the street or crowded alleys and courts, into public-houses; indeed, their attention has never been directed to the interior of any house whatever, to reform the parties or to prevent the engendering of crime; neither does such a disposition exist any where, the mere thieftaker despising the means of prevention, the philanthropic parish or ward constable, the benevolent headborough, or others serving in their own right, being the only persons who ever cast away a thought upon the subject. <quote>I

I leave out of consideration here, the thief who steals through necessity, as also those who, in early life, may be set on by unprincipled relatives, and they again who are first seduced by the charms of portable property, carelessly left within reach. For these nought remains but coercion ; instant detection, and immediate exemplary punishment. Only one opinion regarding the treatment proper to be exercised towards practised thieves prevails; but it would be inhuman to treat first offences, incipient robbery, or thefts of necessaries of life, as you would the arrant knaveries of him who steals to fence, and fences to carouse, and by his carousals incites others to partake in his crime; to drink of his cup, and to go out upon the next occasion, being necessary consequents.  In this manner, it will be easy enough to prove the greatest number of thieves are made. I would prevent, in great measure, their so falling by bad example ; and shall presently go on to say how.</p>

This is a miserable state of things, and brings me to the proposed remedy, a superintendent, in whom should concentre all the information of all the offices and officers regarding thieves at large; and whose attention should be directed towards the repression of crime, the correction of young offenders, and dispersion of gangs of old ones.</quote></p>
  <p> At present, each individual officer keeps in profound secresy, whatever intelligence may have come to his knowledge singly, or doles out a part to one of his brethren as a bonus; and I have known this spirit carried so far, that one officer has retarded information coming to another, because he wished to have it himself, like the dog in the manger! Is it longer to be endured, that individuals should take upon them to intercept the speedy exercise of justice, upon which so much depends? On the other hand, I must notice that there are some who bring it into disrepute by their officiousness, in taking up trivial matters and occurrences undeserving of attention, or only worthy of rebuke and domestic chastisement.</p>
  <p> To correct this singleness of pursuit, and consequent delays,  every  constable-officer should be compelled to bring in all the information he is possessed of to the superintendent's office. They should be taught to pay instant deference to his paramount authority, in all cases where unity of operation is required; and to a

  Since the foregoing appeared (<date value="1817">1817</date>) the instituion of dismounted patrols, in a livery of blue, with red waistcoats, would seem like an approach towards adopting this suggestion; but the reader will perceive that I could not consistently recommend dressing up in uniforms persons whose duty is to come upon the offenders unawares, and not merely to frighten them.</note> to be obeyed upon every proper occasion for its being displayed. Numerous other ramifications of his duties present themselves to my mind; it is chiefly pervaded with the necessity of a general repression of crime, by the speedy detection and conviction of offenders in the earlier stages; the concentration of all police-information at that one point; daily communication with subordinate officers and sitting magistrates, and active correspondence with all parts of the kingdom, particularly the favourite ports of self-deportation.  Vide Letter 3.</p>
  <p> The obvious duties of a superintendent (call him what you like) would include not only the extinction of such errors by a totally contrary practice, but many other facilities for the detection of crime, the earliest information of plots, conspiracies, concerted robberies, commotions,

   BURGLARS, SPEEDY DETECTION EFFECTED. the retreats of known offenders, the speedy detection of recent thefts, and various other objects of public good. For, in every class of rogues, the rapidity of pursuit and detection is the cause of great dismay; as its procrastination is of exultation and encouragement to their friends, as I have just shewn, page 283.</p>
  <p> Suppose a case: a burglary has been committed during night, with symptoms of violence, crow-bar marks, &amp;c. It follows that this must be an old thief; for young ones are not to be brought to so high a game at first. He must, then, be known to some officers (he ought to be known to the whole): and he must have reconnoitred the premises by day, or tried them at night; at least it generally (always) comes out that the chief of a gang does so. Well, then, in going or coming he ought to have been met and recognized by some one of the police.  If the latter notes down this, or any other suspicious circumstance comes to his knowledge, he will most likely seek out the offender by himself, that he himself may enjoy the credit, and the reward of conviction. He does not reflect that others of his brethren may have some other information to supply, which might complete the chain; whereas, the clue is often lost for awhile, and lost and found again; meantime the offender is extending his ravages, increasing in boldness, and affording, by his example, encouragement to the timid, and confirming the half-formed rogue in the like courses. But how much more effec-

  <p>When old offenders have known places of resort, usually at small places, in public

When his period of detention is completed, where is the excarcerated to go but to his old friends, his haunts: at such a place alone is he likely to be found and reclaimed; or found amidst his fellows, planning new thefts and endeavouring to laugh off his recent sufferings. In one case, how cruel to <quote>disperse the gang,</quote> as we are accustomed to hear recommended in the papers; in the other event, how useless to disperse the just white-washed culprit along with his less unlucky com-rogues! Much more efficacious, in the sequel, would be the forcible dismissal from the contamination of such a party, of every juvenile offender, of the doubtfully honest or incipient thief, per authority of the landlord of the house; the same would take place in a private dwelling, though the resort of dishonest persons, I believe from report, unless they be of the most depraved class in the long catalogue of offenders. Loose females, of the tenderest age, usually attend such haunted public houses, laying claim to one as a brother, to another as a sweetheart and so on, but always inciting them to theft by the surest seductions: blandishments, example, instruction, ridicule, flash songs and Botany-bay pastorals, are among the arts employed by such girls upon mere boys, and on some fellows much older.

I was even led to lament that power was not vested somewhere, to inflict summary punishment off-hand on pilfering children under a certain age: not by stripping and tying up the least, but giving them what is termed <soCalled>"a good lacing "</soCalled> round the room, at the hands of a

By the way, this must be the reason that this species of corporal punishment has been so much decried in naval discipline; the lubbers and nincompoops, the psalm-singers and old women, who compose this genus of thinkers, not being aware that a squadron of ships cannot be kept in sailing order without it: though I remember the case of a single ship [quere two] being so manned with the elect of a fleet, whereby it got christened <soCalled>"The Ten Commandments."</soCalled> By this nickery more harm was done in the aggregate than good. People of weak perception should examine matters such as these closer than it seems they are wont: on board ship, for example, or at our prisons, if they dare.

On a former occasion, I adduced the case of an entire party of such larceny rogues being brought to the brink of reformation, by the deeply execrated report of its effects by one of their acquaintance who had just suffered it; but I hesitate to repeat particulars, because of the full reformation, I am disposed to believe, followed.  Finally, I must insist (for the first time in my life) that unless flogging be persisted in strenuously toward dishonest youth, and even honest boys, frequenting the company of known thieves, in-door as well as out, no other hope remains of thwarting the accession of numbers to the several nests of street-thieves that infest every quarter of the metropolis, upon the obverse of the principle, that <quote>to spare the rod is to spoil the child;</quote> and because I have found, from  the acknowledgements of many, very many parents of such culprits, that the desired salutary correction was out of their power, or at variance with their feelings.

To this salutary end, the measure now in progress (as I apprehend) and referred to at page 288, will most assuredly tend; and provided it be worked well, sedulously and without flinching, must effect much real good. A thousand ramifications of that measure flit across my mind, by far too numerous for the present space; but I will not conclude this division of my subject, without adverting to one point which is very likely to be mistaken in toto, or carried so far as to render a very desirable means of detecting thieves, the cause of some private injury.</p>
  <p>Stopping and searching known thieves, when there is cause to suspect their object, is the indispensable duty of officers; and if the search be enforced whenever they appear from home, or linger along any where, they have no reasonable cause of complaint. Norwhen they follow, or are followed by, a newly-seduced lad, who usually carries the booty, but whom the thief keeps in view, is any blame to be attached to the officer searching, though nothing be found on the party. The search operates sanatively, and should be enforced. But in some instances of reformed thieves, who get into place, or drive

Reformation is often aspirated after by thieves <quote>out of luck,</quote> or under alarm for their safety; benevolent people sometimes find them employment, even from the bar of the Old Bailey; <note place="foot" n="\i">Bill Perry was one of those: he had been several times tried, was under the necessity of purloining, having long propitiated employment in vain; and the foreman of the jury, who last convicted him, took him into his yard as a helper; there I saw him, employed him to obtain facts for my first-book on this subject,-believed him honest, and that he so continued until he went to his long home. He told me it was not he, but a relation, who was concerned with Knight, (the Squire,) who negotiated the stolen bills for Dudfield, Treble, Palmer, &amp;c. spoken of a few pages farther down. </note> and a wise policy would extend to these any mode of reclamation all the facilities in the power of the state to give. Certificates of reform might be issued to all approved applicants, specifying particulars of place, occupation, and employers' names, which should exempt the bearer from the right of search.

  <p>Searching has been pursued in the city with more assiduity than by the officers of the policeoffices, and of course with more success.

Similar was the defence of the Crowthers, last year, against the two constables of St. Luke's, who took them in flagrante delictu, and got ruined by law-expenses for their reward.

  <p>Bow-street officers were employed upon most occasions in the city until the year <date value="1808">1808</date>, when the marshals expurgated their subordinates, and put their establishment upon better bases. At the present day their system (no; mode of proceeding) is excellent, notwithstanding the few lapses both of marshals and men in the interval, some of which I exposed in my former publications; and, both in the second and third letters, recommended its abrogation as a separate establishment. For example-the marshal at one time did not pay his people rightly, and the rogues had recourse to extortion, to bloodmoney, and other expedients to make up the deficiency in the means of life. Holdsworth and Canner, who commanded the civil force at the former period, sought for information, as to the persons and haunts of thieves, at the hands of the very men (of Bow-street) whom they meant to supersede; whilst these, as matter of trade, contrived to render both ridiculous, by introducing thefirst to parties of arrant thieves, to carouse and shake hands, (that cover of insidiousness); and the second marshal to the bisexual bad houses of Dudfield, Burdett, and B-n, in Fleur-de-lis-court, in Silver-street, and in Clifford's-Inn-court respectively. What a

</p><p><note place="head"> REPORTERS AID ACCUSERS, WRONGLY.</note></p><p> contamination ! What a piece of bad taste and ill-judgement in the first officers of the first of cities!  None such, to the farthest degree, being known, should ever come in contact with the foes to good order; and of this the chief marshal was convinced by the Mackcouljust mentioned; whereupon Mr. Holdsworth forbade the Bow-street officers to interfere with the city police. Accordingly, and very naturally, as things were then managed, they threatened vengeance against Mackcoul, and nearly executed their purpose, as before said; whilst the second marshal, emulating his chief (of the nodding plume) and acting under the influence of his <quote> bad-house intelligencers,"</quote> joined his powers to theirs-though it is not for a moment to be supposed Mr. Canner knew the real perpetrators were <soCalled>"in Co."</soCalled> with his intimates, Messrs. Dudfield and Burdett, who doubtless urged him on to sacrifice Mackcoul. <note place="foot" n="\i">This person's history of the persecution carried on against him, is well worthy the perusal of all who would push their inquiries farther: he entitles his pamphlet,

  <p>Reporters of police matters are not only thus apt to take up a cause, so as to make their report tell in reading, so as to charm, alarm, or amuse the public, but they frequently conjure up pretty little adventitious stuff, to occupy a line or two, or a dozen, which makes a difference in their day's income of one, or two, or twelve pence. They either bepraise and bespatter the magistrates and officers, to conciliate their favour, or, taking a direct contrary course, at times employ the hackneyed <quote>observed the worthy magistrate,</quote> with insidious irony, as applied to the most unworthy remark, into which the man, as a magistrate, in the weakness of human nature, was ever betrayed. In the late inquiry at Bow-street, respecting the large robberies of valuable shops and of bankers' parcels, all of them abstained from mentioning the name of Salmon; and he who ventured, just to invite the curious or the interested in such investigations, <quote> to inquire at any police-office,</quote> being dubbed by Sir R. Birnie a pickpocket, they carefully quoted the hasty words, literis verbis, and with biting malignity inserted, at full, the negativing affidavit of Mr. Johnson, (who had compromised a
<pb id="p.308" n="308"/>
</p><p><note place="head"> GENT. OF THE PRESS, THEIR PRACTICES.</note></p><p> felony,) denying that any officer was engaged in restoring his stolen time-pieces. A very impertinent proceeding, truly; since every body knew already, that the person who negotiated that same was merely the friend of officers, living in a street issuing out of the Strand, as described above, at page 106, and he himself, at full length, in my former volume, at page 225. Some quality of the mind much meaner than absurdity suggested that affidavit; but all those

  <p>Yet do all manner of men dread the press:-

  <p>Extensive robberies of entire stocks of valuable goods, like that of Messrs.

Would such a fellow hesitate about drawing off a watchman from his proper beat, when agreat crack is to be achieved? If he did, he would be a very inconsistent sort of thief. Upon inquiry whereabout he was meddling, when some such extensive night robberies have lately taken place, he will be found to have been no great way off. Wood-street, to wit.</p>

Yet we do not find that the robbers of mails of those kind of valuable parcels, which have been so frequent from the year <date value="1823">1823</date>, trust their contents in the city, in dread of the superior officers' vigilance-not more than one of them labouring under suspicion, viz. a connection with Ikey Solomons, in the Ludgate-hill business, <date value="1825">1825</date>. Those parcels of notes of great amount, I have reason to believe, made no rest in the city nearer than Moorfields, and then moved a little northward; at least such was the case with the first and last lots, obtained per mail ; those of the Ipswich

The last lot, those of Messrs. Whitehead's bank, stolen in Holborn, as every body knows, went to that other Jew's in Northstreet, also in the City-road.</p>
  <p>The negotiations that are known to have been carried on for the restoration of those stolen parcels of notes, and the progress reported from time to time in the papers, reflect high disgrace on the police management of the country: the consummation of that disgrace is the safe performance of each negotiation. To certain magistrates is confided jurisdiction in such affairs; they delegate to their officers the task of catching offenders and bringing them up for examination, in lieu whereof they convert their authority to the means of private emolument, contrary to law, and shield the thieves they are sworn to bring to justice. They thus encourage new depredations of the same and similar kinds, and have only to put up their principals to the tricks, to come exactly within the case of
