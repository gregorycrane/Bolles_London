<p>  HOLLAND HOUSE, after Addison's death,
remained in possession of the Warwick
family and of their heir, Lord Kensington,



<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>

who came of the family of Edwardes, till it
was purchased of his lordship by Henry Fox,
who subsequently became a lord himself, and
took his title from the mansion. This was
about a hundred years ago, in the beginning
of the reign of George the Third.
 </p><p> Henry Fox, the first Lord Holland of the
new race, was the younger son of that
marvellous old gentleman, Sir Stephen Fox,
who, after having had a numerous offspring
by one wife, married another at the age of
seventy-six, and had three more children, two
of whom founded the noble families of Holland
and Ilchester. It was reported that he had
been a singing-boy in a cathedral. Walpole
says he was a footman; and the late Lord
Holland, who was a man of too noble a
nature to affect ignorance of such traditions,
candidly owns that he was a man of "very
humble origin." Noble families must begin


         <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>

with somebody; and with whom could the
new one have better begun than with this stout
and large-hearted gentleman, who after doing
real service to the courts in which he rose,
and founding institutions for the benefit of
his native place, closed a life full of health,
activity, and success, in the eighty-ninth year
of his age ?
  </p><p>Henry Fox was as full of vitality as his
father, and he carried the stock higher; but,
though very knowing, he was not so wise,
and did not end so happily. With him
began the first parliamentary emulation be-
tween a Fox and a Pitt, which so curiously
descended to their sons. Many persons now
living remember the second rivalry.  The
first was so like it, that Walpole, in one of
his happy comprehensive dashes, describes
the House of Commons, for a certain period,
as consisting of " a dialogue between Pitt and




<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>

Fox." The oratory, in the high sense of
the word, was on the Pitt side; but Fox,
though an unequal speaker, partly fluent and
partly hesitating, had acuteness, argument,
and a natural manner; and it was a rare
honour, even for the short time in which he
did so, to divide the honours of emulation
with the man who has been since styled the
"great Earl of Chatham."  Fox had begun
life as a partizan of Sir Robert Walpole;
and in the course of his career, held lucrative
offices under Government-that of Pay-
master of the Forces, for one-in which he
enriched himself to a degree which incurred
a great deal of suspicion.  He was latterly
denounced, in a city address, as the "de-
faulter of unaccounted millions."  Public
accounts, in those times, were strangely neg-
lected; and the family have said, that his
were in no worse condition than those of

    <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>

others; but they do not deny that he was a
jobber. Fox, however, for a long time, did
not care. The joyousness of his tempera-
ment, together with some very lax notions of
morality, enabled him to be at ease with
himself, as long as his blood spun so well.
He jobbed and prospered; ran away with
a duke's daughter; contrived to reconcile
himself with the family (that of Richmond);
got his wife made a baroness; was made a
Lord himself, Baron Holland of Foxley; was
a husband, notwithstanding his jobbing, loving
and beloved; was an indulgent father; a gay
and social friend-in short, had as happy a
life of it as health and spirits could make;
till, unfortunately, health and spirits failed;
and then there seems to have been a remnant
of his father's better portion within him,
which did not allow him to be so well satis-
fied with himself in his decline.  Out-tricked




<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>
and got rid of by the flighty Lord Shelburne,
and forsaken by the selfish friends with whom
he had jobbed and made merry and laughed
at principle, he not only experienced the last
mortifications of a man of the world, but
had retained at least enough belief in the
social virtues to be made seriously unhappy
by the conduct of his worthless companions,
particularly by that of Rigby, the most worth-
less of them all. His lordship had a talent
for vers de societe' and tried to console him-
self with a Lament, in which the name of
Rigby, now unknown out of the pale of
party recollections, comes in, like an involun-
tary burlesque:-</p><p>



<quote rend="blockquote">   "White-liver'd Grenville and self-loving Gower
     Shall never cause one peevish moment more;
     Not that their spite required I should repair
     To southern climates and a warmer air,

           <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>

     Slight was the pain they gave, and short its date;
     I found I could not both despise and hate;
     But, Rigby, what did I for thee endure ?"</quote>

 </p><p> The noble lord tried to divert his melan-
choly with building a villa near Margate, in a
style equally expensive and fantastic, from
which he made visits across the channel to
France and Italy. He also endeavoured to
get some comfort out of a few other worth-
less persons, such as George Selwyn and
Lord March, afterwards "Old Q.," (Duke
of Queensberry) gentlemen who, not being
in want of places, had abided by him. But
all would not do. He returned home and
died at Holland House, twenty years younger
than his father; and he was followed in less
than a month by his wife.     Gray's bitter
lines on the house at Kingsgate are so well
known, and the owner of it, upon the whole,
was so goodnatured a man, probably sinning





<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>
no worse than the companions whose de-
sertion he so lamented, that we are not sorry
to omit them. It is said, that a day or two
before his death, George Selwyn, who had a
passion for seeing dead bodies, sent to ask how
he was, and whether a visit would be welcome.
  </p><p>" Oh, by all means," said Lord Holland.
" If I am alive, I shall be delighted to see
George; and I know, that if I am dead, he
will be delighted to see me."
 </p><p> A curious story is told of the elopement of
the Duke of Richmond's daughter, Lady
Caroline Lenox, who thus speedily followed
her husband to the grave. The Duke was a
grandson of King Charles the Second; and
both he and the Duchess had declined to
favour the suit of Mr. Fox, the son of the
equivocal Sir Stephen. They reckoned on
her marrying another man; and an evening
was appointed on which the gentleman was


      <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>

to be formally introduced as her suitor. Lady
Caroline,  whose  affections  the  dashing
statesman had secretly engaged, was at her
wit's end to know how to baffle this
interview. She had evaded the choice of the
family as long as possible, but this appoint-
ment looked like a crisis. The gentleman is
to come in the evening; the lady is to pre-
pare for his reception by a more than ordinary
attention to her toilet. This gives her the cue
to what is to be done.    The more than
ordinary attention is paid; but it is in a way
that renders the interview impossible.  She
has cut off her eyebrows.  How can she be
seen by anybody in such a trim? The in-
dignation of the Duke and Duchess is great;
but the thing is manifestly impossible.  She
is accordingly left to herself for the night;
she has perfected her plan, in expectation of
that result; and the consequence is, that




<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>
when next her parents inquire for her, she
has gone. Nobody can find her. She is off
for Mr. Fox.
 </p><p> At the corner of Holland House Lane-
the one that is now shut up-is a public
house, the Holland Arms, the sign of which
is the family scutcheon. The supporters of
the shield are a couple of foxes, and in this
emblazonment of it-for the arms in the
peerage have no such device-one of the
foxes holds a rose in his mouth. The rose
is the cognizance of the Richmond family.
Was this an allusion to the stolen bud?
The old Duchess of Marlborough, whose
nephew had been persuaded by Henry, or, as
he was familiarly termed, Harry Fox, to join
him in politics, called him "the fox that had
stolen her goose." Did this put it into Fox's
head to represent himself as the fox that had
stolen the rose ?
   <pb id="p.11" n="11"/>

  </p><p>Lady Caroline appears to have been truly
attached to her husband.   Her death so
soon after his own, was not improbably
occasioned by it; and when he procured her
the title of Baroness, before he was ennobled
himself, she put up their joint coat of arms
in the house, where it is still be seen, with the
motto Re e Marito (king and husband); as
much as to say, that she derived her honours
equally from both.
 </p><p> But the Fox family, during his lordship's
prosperity, had been forced to suffer what
they considered a degradation, in turn.
Among the pictures in Holland House we
have mentioned an interesting one by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, representing, in a group,
Lady Sarah Lenox, who was a very young
sister of Lady Caroline; Lady Susan Fox,
or Strangeways, an equally young daughter
of Henry Fox's cousin, Lord Ilchester, who



<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>
had taken the name of Strangeways; and
Charles Fox, afterwards the great Whig
statesman, who was then a youth of eighteen,
or thereabouts. Lady Susan is looking down
from one of the lower windows of Holland
House; Lady Sarah is lifting a dove towards
her; and Charles Fox holds a copy of verses
in his hand, which he is understood to be re-
peating to Lady Sarah.
 </p><p> Lady Sarah, who was beautiful, is supposed
to have been the heroine of the song " On
Richmond Hill there lives a lass," and to
have been nearly raised to the throne by the
young King, George the Third, who is said
to have frequently ridden past Holland
House, on purpose to catch a sight of her.
She became the wife of Sir Charles Bunbury,
who forsook Mrs. Inchbald for her; but a
divorce ensued, and she married a Napier.
Lady Susan Fox is stated in the Peerage to

            <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>

have married William O'Brien, of Stintsford,
in the county of Dorset, Esquire; but upon
that little word " esquire"-a very little word
now-a-days, but at that time a designation
of some pretension-hangs a tale of dramatic
interest.
</p><p>  One of the amusements in Holland House
was the performance of plays.  It had for-
merly been a court custom, as it now is
again; but Queen Elizabeth, like Queen
Victoria, had the plays performed by pro-
fessional actors. Among those actors, in the
days of the Tudors and Stuarts, were children;
and hence children in private life subsequently
figured sometimes as amateurs.  We have
mentioned a picture in Holland House, by
Hogarth, representing the performance of a
play of Dryden by children, one of whom
was a grand-niece of Sir Isaac Newton. It
may be here added, that another was of the




<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>
Pomfret family, and that two figures in the
background are said to be a Duke and Duchess
of Richmond.
 </p><p> In the January of the year seventeen
hundred and sixty-one, Horace Walpole was
present at a performance of this kind in
Holland House, which greatly entertained
him. But the account of it had better be
given in his own words.
  </p><p>"I was excessively amused (says he) on
Tuesday night. There was a play at Holland
House, acted by children; not all children,
for Lady Sarah Lenox and Lady Susan
Strangeways played the women.    It was
Jane Shore. Mr. Price, Lord Barrington's
nephew, was Gloster, and acted better than
three parts of the comedians; Charles Fox,
Hastings; a little Nichols, who spoke well,
Belmour; Lord Ofaly, Lord Ashbroke, and
other boys, did the rest. But the two girls

       <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>

were delightful, and acted with so much
nature and simplicity, that they appeared the
very things they represented. Lady Sarah
was more beautiful than you can conceive,
and her very awkwardness gave an air of
truth to the shame of the part and the an-
tiquity of the time, which was kept up by her
dress, taken out of Montfaucon. Lady Susan
was dressed from Jane Seymour; and all the
parts were clothed in ancient habits, and with
the most minute propriety.  When Lady
Sarah was in white, with her hair about her
ears, and on the ground, no Magdalen by
Corregio was half so lovely and expressive.
You would have been charmed, too, with
seeing Mr. Fox's little boy of six years old,
who is beautiful, and acted the Bishop of
Ely, dressed in lawn sleeves and with a square
cap. They inserted two lines for him, which
he could hardly speak plainly." (This little





<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>

boy died a general in the year <date value="1811">eighteen hundred and eleven</date>.)
 </p><p> So far, so good; and Horace Walpole is
enchanted with young ladies who act plays.
But ladies who act plays are apt to become
enchanted with actors ; and three years after
this performance of Jane Shore, a catastrophe
occurs at Ilchester House, which makes
Horace vituperate such enchantments as
loudly as if he never had encouraged them.
O'Brien, a veritable actor at the public
theatres, runs away with the noble friend of
Jane Shore, the charming Lady Susan; and
the Foxes, and the Walpoles, and all other
admirers of amateur performances, are in
despair; not excepting, of course, the runner
away with the Duke's daughter.    Horace,
forgetting what he said of Sir Stephen, or
perhaps calling it desperately to mind, declares
that it would have been better had the man


     <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>

been a footman, because an actor is so well
known, that there is no smuggling him in
among gentlefolk.  " II ne sera pas milord
tout comme un autre." The worst of it was,
that Horace had not only been loud in praise
of the young lady's theatricals, but had
eulogised this very O'Brien as a better repre-
sentative of men of fashion than Garrick
himself.
  </p><p> Perhaps it was his eulogy that made
the lady fall in love.  And O'Brien was
really a distinguished  actor, and probably
as much of a gentleman off the stage as
on it. Nay, to say nothing of the doubt
which has been thrown upon the legiti-
macy of Horace himself (who is suspected
to  have been  the  son  of Carr,   Lord
Hervey), the player may even have come
of a better house than a Walpole; for
the Walpoles, though of an ancient, were




<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>
but of a country-gentleman stock; whereas
the name of O'Brien is held to be a
voucher for a man's coming of race
royal.
</p><p>  We do not mean by these remarks to
advocate intermarriages between different
ranks.  There is well-founded objection to
them in the difference of education and
manners, and the discord which is likely to
ensue on all sides. But their general un-
advisedness must not render us unjust to
exceptions.  An Earl of Derby some time
afterwards, was thought to have married good
breeding itself in the person of Miss Farren
the actress; and though Mr. O'Brien, instead
of being smuggled in among the gentlefolk
whom he so well represented, was got off
with his wife to America, their after-lives
are recorded as having been equally happy
and respectable. So Lady Susan, after all,


   <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>

made a better match of it with her actor,
than Lady Sarah with the baronet.
 </p><p> So much for the plays in Holland House,
and the vicissitudes in the marriages of the
Foxes.</p>

<p> STEPHEN, second Lord    Holland, though
by no means destitute of natural abilities or
vivacity, appears to have had in his com-
position too great a predominance of the
animal nature over the spiritual. He was
good-natured, but whimsical; and as he had


        <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>

been allowed to have his way, his way pro-
bably lay chiefly in the eating and drinking
line; for his face is sleepy and sensual, with
very thick lips.  Hence an apoplectic ten-
dency, which took him off at the age of nine-
and-twenty.
  </p><p>But Stephen had a brother, afterwards the
celebrated Charles James Fox, the "man of
the people," who, however he may have
indulged himself in the same way, had life
enough in him to keep him wide awake (and
others too) for nearly twice the time. Indeed,
he may be said, during his youth, to have
had too much life; more animal vitality in
him, and robustness of body to bear it out,
than he well knew what to do with. And
his father is said to have encouraged it by
never thwarting his will in anything. Thus
the boy expressing a desire one day to
"smash a watch," the father, after ascer-




<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>
taining that the little gentleman did positively
feel such a desire, and was not disposed to
give it up, said, "Well, if you must, I sup-
pose you must;" and the watch was smashed.
Another time, having been promised that he
should see a portion of a wall pulled down,
and the demolition having taken place while
he was absent, and a new portion supplied,
the latter itself was pulled down, in order
that the father's promise might be kept,
and the boy not disappointed. The keeping
of the promise was excellent, and the wall
well sacrificed; but not so the watch; and
much less the guineas with which his father
is absolutely said to have tempted him to the
gaming table, out of a foolish desire to see
the boy employed like himself.    Habits
ensued which became alarming to the old
gamester himself, and which impeded the
rise, injured the reputation, and finally

    <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>

nullified that supremacy on the part of the
son, which was borne away from   him  by
the inferior but more decorous nature of
Pitt.
 </p><p> Fox was a great lesson as to what is good
and what is bad in fatherly indulgence. All
that was good in him it made better; all that
was bad it made worse. And it would have
made it worse still, had not the good luckily
preponderated, and thus made the best at
last even of the bad. Charles was to have
his way as a child; so he smashed watches.
He was to have his way as a youth; so he
gambled and was dissolute.  He was to have
his way as a man; so he must be in parliament, and get power, and vote as his father
did, on the Tory side, because his father had
indulged him, and he must indulge his
father.
 </p><p> But his father died, and then the love




<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>
of sincerity which had been taught the youth
as a bravery and a predominance, was encouraged to break forth by the galling of his
political trammels; and though he could not
refuse his passions their indulgence, till friends
rescued him from insolvency, and thus piqued
his gratitude into amendment, that very circumstance tended to show that he added
strength and largeness of heart to his father's
softness; for the spoilt child and reckless
gamester, though he never could become the
ruling power in a state which had got into
the hands of mere conventional decorums
(for his brief occupations of office are
to be counted as nothing), finally settled
down as the representative of a nobler
age that was coming, and was the charm
in private of all who admired simplicity
of manners, and the perfection of good
sense.
    <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>

 </p><p> Apart from this love of truth, we do
not take him, in any respect, to have been
profound, or to have seen beyond the next
generation.  In none of his departures from
conventionalities, practical or theoretical, did
he incline to go beyond the warrant of the
liberality of the day. His love of truth itself,
perhaps, was none the worse for his indolence.
He found it easiest as well as noblest to take
to its broad, straight road.  Not that the
reputation of truth is to suffer on that account. It only shows how good it is for
temperaments of all kinds. His oratory was
very effective, from its vehemence and sincerity; yet nobody now reads it.  His " History of James the Second" in spite of
his reputation as the greatest master of
the subject, was a general disappointment.
His reading, though far from being of a
narrow description, lay chiefly in the middle



<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>

 classes of literature, and leaned to style
and manners rather than to any power
beyond them.
 </p><p> What was greatest in Charles Fox was
his freedom from all nonsense, pettiness, and
pretention. He could by no means admit
that greater was smaller, or the rights of the
American or French nations inferior to those
of their princes.  He envied no man his
good qualities; felt under no necessity of
considering his dignity with young or old;
thought humanity at large superior to any
particular forms of it; and in becoming its
representative in circles which would have
conceded such a privilege to none but a man
of birth, enabled them to feel how charming
it was, and thus became the most cherished
head of a party, that ever, perhaps, existed.
An excess of this geniality of nature, on the
wrong side of it, when he was young, had

 <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>

given a tendency to his jovial body, which
cut him off with a dropsy before he was old.
At least, he was but fifty-eight; which was
not an age at which a man of so strong a
constitution ought to have died. But the
wisdom of the spiritual portion of it survived
the folly of the rest, just as soul itself
survives body; and this kept him the consistent statesman, and the pleasant sage of private life, to the last.
 </p><p> The spoilt child prevailed so long in the
life of Fox, and, to all appearance, so irremediably, that accounts of him at different
periods seem hardly recording the same man.
 </p><p> To give instances, in as few words as possible. We have seen the smashing of the
watch.
 </p><p> When a youth, he was a great admirer of
peerages and ribbons; and on his return
from his first visit to the continent, he appeared




<pb id="p.28" n="28"/>

 in red-heeled shoes, and a feather
in his hat-the greatest fopperies of the
day.
  </p><p>His father paid a hundred and forty thousand pounds for his gaming debts.
  </p><p>He took to the other extreme in dress,
and became as slovenly as he had been foppish.
 </p><p> On coming into office, he showed that he
could be as industrious as he had been idle.
 </p><p> Whenever he was in office, he never
touched a card; and when his political friends,
out of a sense of what was due to his
public services, finally paid his debts, and
made him easy for life, he left off play entirely.
 </p><p> He dressed decently and simply, and
settled down for the remainder of his life
into the domestic husband, the reader of
books, and the lover of country retirement,


     <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>

from which he could not bear to be absent
for a day.
  </p><p>In Holland House Fox, passed his boyhood and part of his youth.   He is not
much associated with it otherwise, except
as a name. He and a friend, one day, without a penny in their pockets, walked thither
from Oxford, a distance of fifty miles;
for the purpose, we suppose, of getting a
supply.  They resolved to do it without
stopping on the road; but the day was hot;
an alehouse became irresistible; and on ar-
riving at their journey's end, Charles thus addressed his father, who was drinking his coffee:
"You must send half a guinea, or a guinea
without loss of time to the alehouse-keeper
at Nettlebed, to redeem the gold watch you
gave me some years ago, and which I have
left in pawn there for a pot of porter."
 </p><p> A little before he died, he drove several


<pb id="p.30" n="30"/>

times with his wife to Holland House, and
looked about the grounds with a melancholy
tenderness.
 </p><p> But, notwithstanding the celebrity of
Charles Fox, and that of Addison himself,
the man who has drawn the greatest attention to Holland House, if not in his own
person, yet certainly by the effect of his
personal qualities and attainments upon other
people, was Fox's nephew, the late Lord
Holland, Henry Richard, third of the title.
He succeeded to the title before he was a year
old; rescued the old mansion from ruin, as
before noticed; and with allowance for visits
to the continent, and occasional residence in
town, may be said to have passed his whole
life in it, between enjoyments of his books,
and hospitalities to wits and worthies of all
parties.
 </p><p> Lord Holland was a man of elegant literature,

         <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>

 of liberal politics, of great benevolence.
Travelling like other young noblemen on the
continent, but extending his acquaintance
with it beyond most of them, and going into
Spain, his inclinations became directed to the
writers of that country, and his feelings
deeply interested in their political struggles.
The consequence was a work in two volumes,
containing the Lives of Lope de Vega and
Guillen de Castro, a translation of three Spanish comedies, and the most hospitable and
generous services to the patriots who suffered
exile in the cause of their country's freedom.
The comedies we have never seen. The lives,
though not profound (for his lordship was
educated in a school of criticism anterior to
that of Coleridge and the Germans), are excellent as far as they go, written with classical correctness, and full of the most pleasing
and judicious remarks. The friendly intercourse


<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>

 to which he invited all who were
distinguished on the liberal side of politics or
wit, had, in the mean time, constituted, him a
kind of representative of theirs in the great
world.  The Edinburgh Review was said,
(though erroneously) to be concocted at Holland
House, owing to the residence with him of
his friend Mr. Allen, who was one of its
principal contributors;  and the reputation
thus publicly acquired was maintained at
his hospitable table by a conversation which,
though full of his personal good-nature, was
remarkable for its exaction of the severest
reasoning, and the most scrupulous attention
to facts. How he reconciled this nicety, or
his liberal principles in general, with that
unbounded admiration for Bonaparte, which
has lately transpired in his posthumous "Recollections of Foreign Courts," it is difficult
to say. The admiration, we have no doubt,


    <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>

was driven into the inconsistency by the hypocrisy and broken promises of Bonaparte's
enemies, the kings and ministers, who pretended to oppose him in behalf of freedom.
The same disgust at hypocrisy, sharpened by
personal experience of the inconsistency of
those customs in his own country which will
discountenance at court what they consecrate
at the altar, led him to speak freely of this
habits of courts in general; and offence was
taken at the moment, both at his Napoleon predilections and his old-world aversions.  The
cloud on the memory of so warm a heart
was not calculated to last. Privately he will be
remembered only for his benevolence, and for
the great increase of pleasant associations
which he has given to Holland House; and
there is a reigning circumstance in his career,
which will procure him a niche in the parliamentary history of his times, equally unique


<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>
and beautiful-and that is, that whenever a
measure was carried through the House of
Lords which was not of a just or generous
nature, Lord Holland's " Protest" against it
was sure to be found upon the records. He
might have been called, in a new sense of the
word, the Protestant Peer.  There is a book
of his also, which will live, the other posthumous work, entitled, "Reminiscences of
the Whig Party." It is written not only
with correctness and elegance, but with a
charming mixture of acuteness and good-
nature-of the sharp and the sweet, the
" true pine-apple flavour," and contains some
masterly portraitures of character.
 </p><p> It is a pity that the lives of such men are
not always as long as they might be. Lord
Holland had a constitutional tendency to gout
which, till he was married, he kept under by
hard riding and hunting, of which, up to that


    <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>

period, he had been extremely fond.  He
afterwards, like his uncle Charles, used to
play at tennis, and to fish; for, with the
same inconsistency, and like many another
good man before him (and since) he was an
instance of the wonderful effect of habit and
education in being able to blink the unanswerable objection that lies at the core of
all reasoning on the subject of "sporting;"
to wit, the unwarrantableness of any pleasure
founded on the infliction of pain. During
the last twenty years of his life, his gout
conspired with his love of books to render
him less and less active, till at last he became
wholly confined to his chair; and the disease
killed him at the age of sixty-seven.
 </p><p> It has been observed of the Fox face, that
it improved with every generation.  Lord
Holland is described in a contemporary letter
of one of his relations as being very handsome




<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>

when a child, and he was comely
throughout life. The only objection to be
made to his face was, that the nose, though
of a manly shape and well-formed, was somewhat too small-a defect to which his friend
Napoleon, who thought nothing was to be
done but by men with well-developed noses,
would have attributed the inactivity that
hastened his end. Perhaps it was lucky for
the Emperor that his future panegyrist,
though he good-humouredly encouraged
playful allusions to the defect from his
family, was not aware of the great man's
opinion in this respect; which has but lately,
we believe, transpired. His lordship might
have observed, however, that if his life was
not so stirring as the great captain's, it was
longer, more his own, and had a better end;
that his uncle Charles, though he had nose
enough to lead a great party, died of a dropsy,


    <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>

nine years sooner; and that the Emperor
himself would have been luckier, even as a
soldier, if his nose had not induced him to
thrust it into Spain and Moscow.

<p>  NEAR Holland House, in a portion, still
accessible, of the late thoroughfare leading


      <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>

to it, called, Nightingale Lane, stands Little
Holland House; a small mansion compared
with the other, but still a mansion; isolated,
countryfied, and standing in a garden. Here
Mrs. Inchbald once spent a couple of weeks
with its occupant, a Mr. Bubb, and dined
frequently with him  on Sundays (who was
he?); and here lived and died Miss Fox,
the sister of the late Lord Holland, a lady
deserving to be remembered; for everybody
seems to have loved her. In her girlhood,
she and a young friend, Miss V., a distant
connection of the family, were much in the
house of another family connexion, the first
Lord Lansdowne, at that time Lord Shelburne
the minister, where she became intimate with
his Lordship's protege, Jeremy Bentham,
who at that time was still young himself.
The future venerable jurist possessed a great
deal of vivacity; played on the harpsichord


<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>

and violin; and being in a curious state of
perplexity between his amatory and his cross-
examining tendencies, appears to have fallen
at one and the same time, in love with Miss
V., and in dread of the match-making intentions of his noble host, who seems
privately  as well as publicly to  have
been considered a very plotting personage.
Bentham thought that his Lordship was
constantly meditating marriages for all his
young lady visitors. The consequence was,
that the philosopher delayed the declaration
of his love till he was grown old; and what
is more curious, he took it to heart that the
lady refused him. He had not much cultivated
her acquaintance meantime; yet seems to
have concluded, that she had remained single
on purpose to wait her chance. We do not
know whether he ever again saw the lady,
after the refusal; but one of the last glimpses


           <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>

which biography affords as of himself, is his
walking from Little Holland House, one
Sunday morning, in company with Miss
Fox and the Reverend Sidney Smith, on the
way of the two latter to church. Bentham did
not go to church with them. He did not
think it right; and he was too honest to belie
his opinions. On the other hand, he tells us,
that the reverend wit apologized to him for
going, alleging that it was his " trade."  It
may be doubted, nevertheless, whether Sidney,
in making this apparently "indiscreet" observation, was not bantering the philosopher's
tendency to such assumptions; and intimating that it was hopeless to suppose him
capable of taking any other view of the
proceeding. Wits, however, it must be owned,
are apt to make questionable churchmen.
 </p><p> The turning out of the high road, next to
Nightingale Lane, is Addison Road; and in




<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>
a right angle with this turning, in the high
road itself, is Addison Terrace; places named
after the former illustrious inhabitant of
Holland House.
 </p><p> Addison Road, the houses in which, upon
the whole, are in good taste, is terminated by
the villa of General Fox, in whose person, the
descendants of Sir Stephen Fox have again
married with royalty; the lady of the gallant
officer being one of the daughters of King
William the Fourth.
 </p><p> It is curious to see the new turns that are
taken by the children of new generations. A
royally descended ancestress of the Foxes,
grand-daughter of King Charles the Second,
would as soon have thought of flying to the
moon, as of " editing" a political romance. The
name of Lady Mary Fox has transpired in
editorial connexion with a book of this kind;
which, under the the title of an " Expedition


  <pb id="p.43" n="43"/>

to the Interior of New   Holland," is an
Utopian speculation, remarkable for its powers
of reflection and for its liberal principles,
without, in the least degree, derogating from
what is becoming in the sex of the fair editor.
</p><p>  The landlords of some of the houses in
Addison Road did not very happily christen
them, when they called them " Homer Villa,"
" Cato Cottage," &amp;c. Cato might very well
have lived in a cottage; and his ancestor,
Cato the Censor, probably did; but people
are not accustomed to associate the idea of
Caesar's antagonist with a cottage; and the
impression is not mended, when they find
that the cottage is named after Addison's
tragedy. "Homer Villa" is worse; for who
can associate the idea of the great ancient
wandering poet with a modern citizen's box ?
or what critic could have fancied, that a house
in a road named after Addison would ever


<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>

have been named after Homer, because
Addison was supposed to have written the
version of the first book of the "Iliad,"
which bore the name of his friend
Tickell !
 </p><p> Addison Road is of some length; is
adorned with a modern chapel in good
ancient style; and the backs of the houses
on  the eastern  side  make sequestered
acquaintance with the trees of Holland Park.
Addison Terrace does not do equal honour to
its name. The houses have a thick, stunted,
and huddled appearance. We believe, however,
that they are better and larger than they
seem.
 </p><p> From this point of Kensington, to its
western boundary, a little further on, we
know of nothing worth mention, except the
boundary itself, which runs through the
nursery-grounds of the Messrs. Lee. These

    <pb id="p.45" n="45"/>

grounds have been known in the parish
books, under the title of the Vineyard, ever
since the time of William the Conqueror.
Wine, described as a sort of Burgundy, was
actually made and sold in them, as late as the
middle of last century.
 </p><p> Wine was formerly made in many parts
of England, probably in no great quantity.
It naturally gave way to drinks more congenial to the soil. The right, popular wine
of countries which do not produce wine of
the best quality, is that which free trade
ought to bring them (and will bring them)
from those which do.
 </p><p> Another interesting circumstance connected
with this spot, is, that it has been in the
hands of the respectable family that occupies it,
for three generations. The founder of it, James
Lee,author of one of the earliestpopular systems
of Botany, was a correspondent of Linnaeus.




<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>
 </p><p> In order to avoid the dullness of retracing
our steps, we go a little beyond the bounds
of the parish, and turning north and westward through pleasant Brook Green, and no
less poetically-named Shepherd's Bush, return
to it, and ascend Notting (originally, perhaps,
Nutting) Hill. By this we arrive at Kensington Gravel-pits, which is a kind of second
Kensington High Street, being to the
northern boundary line of the suburb, in
the Uxbridge Road, what the High Street,
commonly so called, is to Kensington Proper,
the road to Hammersmith.
</p><p>  Since the disappearance of the actual
Gravel-pits, their name seems to have been
superseded, of late years, by the joint influence of the new streets on Notting Hill and
in Bayswater, all this portion of Kensington
to the west of the turnpike being now addressed, we believe, post-officially, as Notting


          <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>

Hill; and all of it, to the east of the turnpike, being understood, in like manner, to
belong to Bayswater.
 </p><p> We regret the loss of the old name, for
many reasons. The district called the Gravel-
pits, or at least so called in books, and in
directions of letters, appears, on a rough
calculation, to have comprehended all the
north and north-western side of Kensington,
lying between Notting Hill, Bayswater, Holland House, the Church, and the Palace.
 </p><p> Readers may call to mind a remnant of
one of the pits, existing but a few years ago,
to the north of the Palace in Kensington
Gardens, and adding greatly to their picturesque look thereabouts.  A pleasant poetical
tradition was connected with it, of which we
shall have something farther to say. Now,
the Gravel-pits were the fashionable suburb
resort of invalids, from the times of William



<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>

and Anne to the close of the last century.
Their " country air," as it was called, seems
to have been preferred, not only to Essex,
but to Kent. Garth, in his "Dispensary,"
makes an apothecary say, that sooner than a
change shall take place, from making the poor
pay for medicine, to giving it them gratis,
</p><p>

     <quote rend="blockquote">      "Alps shall sink to vales,
     And leeches in our glasses turn to whales,
     Alleys at Wapping furnish us new modes,
     And Monmouth Street Versailles with riding hoods:
     The rich to th' Hundreds in pale crowds repair,
     And change the Gravel-pits for Kentish air."

</quote>
 </p><p>  Swift had lodgings in the Gravel-pits
during the winters of <date value="1712">1712</date> and <date value="1713">1713</date>; and
Lord Chatham's sister, Anne Pitt (as like
him, says Horace Walpole, " as two drops of
fire ") is recorded to have died at " her house,
in Pitt Place, Kensington Gravel-pits," in

    <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

<date value="1780">1780</date>.  In the pleasant little corner entitled
the Mall (why so called we know not, probably from its having been a more open place
formerly, and frequented by players of the
game so called) lived and died, not long
since, the admired painter of our cold northern skies and sea-coasts, Sir Augustus
Callcott; whose death was followed, in the
same place, by that of his wife, previously
known as Mrs. Graham   (an estimable writer
of travels and history).  It had been preceded, some years, also, in the same place,
by that of his brother, William  Callcott, a
learned and interesting musician, celebrated
for his composition of glees. He was author
of the pathetic composition, " It was a Friar
of Orders Grey;" and is understood to have
been the ruin of Sir John Hawkins's " History of Music," by no greater weapon than a
musical pun; having expressed, in a catch on


<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>
the subject, his preference of Burney's History; which, by the frequent repetition of its.
title, in contradistinction to that of Sir John's
was made to say, with a horrible re-iteration,
"Burn his History."
</p><p>

     <quote rend="blockquote"> Have you Sir John Hawkins' hist'ry ?
      Some folks think it quite a myst'ry.
      Music fill'd his wondrous brain;
      How d'ye like him ? Is it plain?

  </p><p> M. Fetis, the     most learned of musical
critics, has well disposed of the merits of the
two histories, by showing, that neither of
them was as good as the author supposed;
but that each contains matter wanting in the
      <pb id="p.51" n="51"/>

other, and turnable to account.  Burney,
however, besides being a musician professed,
had made himself personally acceptable in
the circles of literature and fashion, by his
agreeable manners; whereas, Hawkins, who
was only an amateur (he had been bred an
attorney), was pragmatical, niggardly, and
censorious. Hawkins was one of those men
who, in a special manner, "take upon themselves to know;" and, like most such persons,
he was apt to pronounce grand final judgments upon things of which he knew little.
Hence the epitaph that was written upon
him, and that so briefly and pleasantly expresses the knight's pompous manner, and
the nothings which he uttered.

 </p><p> Turning southwards from the Mall towards


<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>
Church Street, the visitor of Kensington
lately passed Sheffield House, which owed its
name to property possessed in this quarter
by another pompous man, who made great
pretentions in his day to wit and poetry--
Sheffield, Duke of Buckinghamshire (he is
often erroneously called Duke of Buckingham). Sheffield is said to have made love
to Queen Anne when she was princess; and
he subsequently married her illegitimate
sister, Catherine Darnley, a personage as
pompous as himself.
  </p><p> The property, we believe, is still in the
possession of a respectable descendant of the
Sheffield family; and a new and pretty line
of houses, overlooking Campden House Garden, has received their name.
  </p><p> Sheffield House has disappeared; and on
its site (while we are writing these notices)
another line of houses is in course of erection,

<pb id="p.53" n="53"/>

 the backs of which look towards Palace
Gardens, and ought to have pretty gardens
of their own, if justice be done to the picturesque, broken ground, with its trees and
bushes, that lies between the two thorough-
fares.
 </p><p> We are now approaching the northern
end of that same Church Street, which we
noticed when passing on the south along
High Street. We glance, for a moment, up
pretty little Campden Grove, a street so called
for its possession of one side of a woody bit
of ground; and step again into Church
Street, for the purpose of noticing a gateway next the George Tavern, inscribed,
"Newton House."     This gateway belongs
to a large old brick house, which stands in
a curious, evading sort of way, as if it would
fain escape notice, at the back of other houses
on both sides of it; but notice escape it




<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>

must not; since it was the residence of no
less a man than Isaac Newton.
 </p><p>The great astronomer came here from
London in consequence of an attack of the
lungs, from which he appears to have been
rescued by a fit of the gout.  We have
already mentioned some property which he
possessed in another part of Kensington.
Sir Isaac lived in this house for two years;
then returned very ill of another disease to
London; again returned to Newton House,
and died there in less than a month. The
house  is  now  a boarding-school.  The
memory of Newton has rendered this out-of-
the-way looking place the most illustrious
spot in Kensington; but Newton is in no
want of record, and we must return to the
spot just mentioned, on which Sheffield
House is being displaced by a new line of
buildings, in order to notice a mossy old


    <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>

buttressed dead wall, which occupies the
other side of the way, and which   is the
garden wall of another old house possessing
an interest of a different yet peculiar sort,
not unsuitable to its appearance.
 </p><p> This is Campden House; and we are here
on the eastern border of Campden Hill,
which forms a larger portion of the same
elevated ground on which Holland House is
situate.  Between the  two houses lies a
pleasant enclosed district of some extent,
occupied by detached villas, with their respective gardens. One of them belongs to
the Bedford family. Sir John South possesses
a house and observatory in the western portion of the hill; new streets, on a small but
agreeable scale, are daily rising to the north
and east of this house: Campden Grove,
which we have just glanced at, is among
them; and north of Campden Grove is



<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>
Campden House, which is still the most conspicuous object in this quarter, as it has ever
been since it was first erected about <date value="1612">1612</date> by
Sir Baptist Hickes, a wealthy silk mercer of
Cheapside, founder of the old Hickes's Hall at
Clerkenwell, which the present Sessions House
superseded.  Sir Baptist was one of the
money-made baronets of James the First,
who afterwards advanced him to the titles
of Lord Hickes and Viscount Campden (of
Campden   in  Gloucestershire).  He was
reported to have " purchased or won "
the house "at some sort of game," from
Sir Walter Cope, the lord of the manor,
and builder of Holland House.    But Sir
Walter and Sir Baptist were both such
prudent persons, that we hold the story of
the game to be nought.    The wary old
gentlemen were not likely to have bowled
away one another's houses at a game of



     <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>

skittles, as Duke Sheffield or Sir John Suckling might have done. The old parishioners
had probably seen the comfortable old boys
at skittles together, and could not well
understand how the silk mercer could
have set up so fine a rival establishment
in the neighbourhood of the lord of the
manor, without some such piece of good
luck.
 </p><p> Viscount Campden's heiress, his only
child, took her father's titles into the family
of the Noels of Rutland, who became Earls
of Gainsborough, an honour now extinct.
In <date value="1645">1645</date>, during the Commonwealth, the
third Viscount was obliged to compound for
Campden House with the Commissioners
of Sequestration, who for a time ousted his
lordship, and took the house for their official
residence. At the restoration, Charles the
Second went one night to sup with him.


<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>

The Viscount's father-in-law, the third Earl
of Lindsay, famous for offering to sacrifice
himself for the salvation of Charles the First,
and for having, when young, surrendered
himself prisoner at the battle of Edgehill,
in order to be able to attend on his captured
father, died in Campden House; a circumstance which, whatever may be thought of
his politics, gives a consecration to the place
for its association with so loving and noble
a spirit. Thirty years afterwards the house
was let to Princess, subsequently Queen
Anne, who, for the accommodation of her
household, made a considerable addition to it
on the western side, which is now let apart
from the other, and called Little Campden
House. The Princess had been residing at
Craven Hill, in the house of the old lord of
that name, for the benefit of the health of
her son, the infant Duke of Gloucester,


  <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>

whom she now brought here; and here she
and her husband, George of Denmark,
divided their time with their other mansions
in anxious pursuit of that object, the Duke
being the only child that was left them out
of a numerous family, and presumptive heir
to the crown.
 </p><p> The history of this poor little personage
is painfully curious.  There is a common
saying, " As happy as a prince;" and if ever
prince was thought happy by those who were
not in the secret of courts, this premature
victim of his birth and breeding was probably held to be supremely so, especially by
all the little boys of England. He was heir
to a throne; he lived apart from its troubles
in the house of his father and mother; and,
what must have appeared a stupendous felicity in the eyes of the little boys, he not only
possessed a real, right-earnest, steel sword,



<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>

instead of one made of lath and paint, and
besides that, a suit of real soldiers' clothes-
absolute right earnest regimentals, all red and
gold-but, amazing to think! he was colonel
of a positive regiment of boys, all dressed in
soldier's clothes too. He rode at the head of
them; he sat opposite them during parade on
a live horse, his own pony; could order them
about, and cry March! and look grand and
manly; and all the while music would play-
real proper fifes, and drums, and trumpets,
not at all "penny;" and he had cannon too,
and castles, and a wooden horse to put his
soldiers on, when they did wrong; and they
stood sentinels at his door-ways, and were
the terror of the neighbouring cake-shops
and apple-stalls, like any proper full-grown
gentlemen soldiers. They even had field-days
on Wormwood Scrubs, and reviews in Kensington Gardens, and King William was

    <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>

there to see. In short, Campden House was
Little Boy's Paradise.
 </p><p> Alas! the god of this paradise was a
sickly, big-headed child, the victim of his
very birth and breeding, and doomed to an
early death. He was the only survivor of
seventeen children, not one of whom ought
to have been born; for Anne had destroyed
her person and constitution by gross living-
a propensity derived from her mother, Anne
Hyde, perhaps from her grandfather Clarendon; and as the most important of all
physiologies was not studied in those days,
nobody seems to have suspected (indeed few
people still suspect) what disastrous liabilities
are entailed upon offspring by habits of this
or of any other injurious kind, in parents.
The poor little prince was afflicted with
water on the brain. He had a head large
enough for a grown person, with all the



<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>
sickly tendencies that accompany such a
warning symptom; yet his dull, though
anxious, and not naturally unkind parents,
so little knew how to treat him, or attended
so little to the advice of those who knew
better, that after making him weak in body
and obstinate in mind with wrong indulgences, they tried to force him into health
and good temper by severe treatment. The
poor child was flogged to make him take his
medicine; flogged to make him walk when
he needed help; flogged to make him go up
and down stairs. At the age of eleven he
was no more.
  </p><p>We shall have more to say of Anne and
her husband when we come to Kensington
Palace. In the year <date value="1704">1704</date>, Campden House
was in the occupation of the Dowager Countess of Burlington and her son Richard Boyle,
afterwards Earl, famous for his taste in the


      <pb id="p.63" n="63"/>

fine arts. The Boyles had married into the
Noel family.  Not many years afterwards,
the Noels parted with the property to Nicholas
Lechmere, a Whig lawyer and politician who
was created Lord Lechmere, and who resided
here several years.  He was Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster.    His Lordship
made some noise in his time, but is now
distinguished for nothing but the place which
he occupies in Gay's (or Swift's) ballad entitled
" Duke upon Duke," of which he is the joint
hero with one Sir John Guise, another distinguished gentleman who has vanished into
nothingness. The adventure related by the
ballad itself has become equally obscure.
Lechmere   and  Guise,  whom    it  styles
Duke of Guise, appear to    have been a
couple of cronies, as proud and fiery as
one another, though not equally valiant.
Lechmere invites Guise to a game at whist


<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>

in Campden House. Guise says he can't
come, owing to the gout.      Lechmere goes
in a passion to Guise's house at Brompton,
to insist on his coming.
</p><p>

      <quote rend="blockquote"> The Duke in wrath call'd for his steeds,
         And fiercely drove them on:
       Lord ! Lord! how rattled then thy stones,
         O kingly Kensington!</quote>


 </p><p> Guise persists in not stirring, till Lechmere
tweaks his nose, and gives him a box on the
ear!   Upon this, Guise knocks Lechmere
down. Lechmere challenges Guise, and the
challenge is accepted; but when they go out
to fight, the challenger contrives to get into
his carriage and give his foe the slip:
</p><p>
     <quote rend="blockquote">  Back in the dark, by Brompton Park,
         He turned up through the Gore;
       So slunk to Campden House so high
         All in his coach and four.
</quote>

         <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>
</p><p>
The ballad is witty, but very coarse. Lechmere appears to have been a kind of grim
dandy.
</p><p>
        <quote rend="blockquote">Firm on his front his beaver sate;
           So broad, it hid his chin;
        For why ? he deem'd no man his mate,
          And fear'd to tan his skin.

        With Spanish wool he dy'd his cheek,
          With essence oil'd his hair;
        No vixen civet-cat so sweet,
           Nor could so scratch and tear.

        Right tall he made himself to show,
          Though made full short by God;
        And when pall other dukes did bow,
          This Duke did only nod.
</quote>

</p><p>Exeunt the two Dukes, as mysteriously as
they enter.
</p><p>
   About the middle of the last century,
Campden House became a fashionable boarding-school.   George Selwyn speaks of going


<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>

there to see a protegee of his, who was held
to be a very lucky person; for he and his
friend Lord March (the late profligate Duke
of Queensberry,-" Old Q ") took   themselves respectively for her father, and left her
a fortune a piece.  She married the late Marquess of Hertford.
  </p><p>Campden House, which had fallen into the
hands of a Mr. Pitt (we know not whether
any relation to the Chatham family), continued to be a boarding-school up to a considerable period of the present century, but
has now again ceased to be such; and though
altered in some respects from its first appearance, and long become two houses instead
of one, it retains an interesting look of other
times. The tenants appear to have studied
its preservation.  The gentleman who lately
occupied the larger portion, which still bears
the name of Campden House (Little Campden

<pb id="p.67" n="67"/>

 House being the designation of the
other), went so far in his love of the antique,
as to build a little old-looking brick tower in
the north-eastern corner of the garden.  It
abuts on the public road, " astonishing the
natives," and startling at first sight the antiquarian passenger, who in vain calls his
records to mind in order to refresh his
memory on the subject. On coming nearer,
the mystery is cleared up by the nature of the
materials and the spirit of the composition;
and he begins to doubt whether the building,
before long, will not be something more of a
ruin than it was intended to appear.  Meantime he sees, however, that there must be
some agreeable prospect from the top window,
for those who have the courage to go up
to it.
</p><p>  We have a liking for hobbies, and a
proper Shandean inclination towards persons



<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>
who go out of the ordinary way of the world
to indulge in them; and we must own we
cannot wish the tower down, now that it is
up.   It reminds us, if not of impregnable
forts and enchanted castles, yet of the love of
such things in imagination; of the books
that speak of them; and of the intense
delight we should have felt in being able to
realize such an edifice for ourselves in childhood.
  </p><p>This last consideration helps the tower to
something of a retrospective propriety, in
relation to the poor little Duke of Gloucester.
These were his own grounds, and this is just
the thing he might have set up in them, after
reading Jack the Giant Killer, or the Seven
Champions of Christendom.   We imagine
him ordering his honest Welsh servant and
biographer, Lewis Jenkins, to personate Jack's
Welsh giant, inside a great wicker-basket

  <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

erection made for the purpose, with a horrible
bushy countenance at the top of it; then to
go to the top of the tower and look down
and goggle and roar horribly, making as if
he would come down and eat Jack; and,
finally, to roar much worse, and shriek so
that nobody ever heard the like, and go
dreadfully shuffling and stooping about while
his Royal Highness Jack cuts his basket-work
all to pieces.
 </p><p> JENKINS. But perhaps your Royal Highness won't quite bear in mind where the false
head begins ; while the real one, inside the stomach, is being frightened.
 </p><p> GLOUCESTER (who is a wit, laughing).
Oh! never mind that, Jenkins. It will only
make it more like right earnest, you know;
and if I fetch blood, you shall have a famous
Welsh rabbit for supper.
 </p><p> Here his Royal Highness's light infantry




<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>

set up a laugh, which Jenkins is obliged to
swallow, though he longs to run at every
one of them, and kick their souls out of
their provoking and prematurely-insolent little
bodies.</p>

<p>  IT is to be hoped, that in the course of
the local improvements which are now being
effected in this quarter of Kensington, a

   <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>

and here health was in vain attempted to be
given to the sicklier temperaments of Edward
the Sixth, who died young, and his sister,
Queen Mary, who lived only to be an unhappy bigot.
</p><p>  As the circumstance, however, does not
appear ascertainable, antiquaries must put up
with the later and less illustrious origin which
has been found for these distinguished premises, in the house and grounds belonging
to the family of the Finches, Earls of Nottingham.   Whether the tenement which
they occupied had once been royal or not, it
seems to have been but a small mansion in
their time; probably consisting of nothing
more than the now least-visible portion of it
north-west; and indeed, though it was subsequently enlarged under almost every one of
the sovereigns by whom it was occupied, it
was never, in one respect, anything but what


<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>

road will be opened between Campden Hill
and the Palace. It would be a great convenience to the natives, and to pedestrians of
all kinds, the topographer included; but as
there is no such thing at present, we must
content ourselves with returning into the
High Street, and so keeping the north side
of the way till it brings us to the Palace
gates.  When we entered Kensington, we
kept the south side. We thus return to the
point at which our survey of the town commenced; and we enter on the climax of our
task.
  </p><p>It is not improbable that Kensington
Palace and Gardens originated in the royal
nursery to which allusion has been made as
having been established in this district, for
the benefit of his children, by King Henry
the Eighth.  If so, here Queen Elizabeth
grew up awhile, as well as Queen Victoria;


<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>
it still is, namely, one of the plainest and
least-pretending of princely abodes.
  </p><p>In vain we are told, that Wren is supposed to have built the south front, and Kent
(a man famous in his time) the east front.
We can no more get up any enthusiasm
about it as a building, than if it were a box,
or a piece of cheese. But it possesses a
Dutch solidity; it can be imagined full of
English comfort; it is quiet; in a good air;
and though it is a palace, no tragical history is
connected with it; all which considerations
give it a sort of homely, fireside character,
which seems to represent the domestic side
of royalty itself, and thus renders an interesting service to what is not always so well
recommended by cost and splendour. Windsor
Castle is a place to receive monarchs in;
Buckingham Palace to see fashion in; Kensington Palace seems a place to drink tea in;

      <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>

and this is by no means a state of things, in
which the idea of royalty comes least home
to the good wishes of its subjects.  The
reigns that flourished here, appositely enough
to this notion of the building, were all tea-
drinking reigns-at least, on the part of the
ladies; and if the present queen does not
reign there, she was born and bred there,
growing up quietly under the care of a
domestic mother; during which time, the
pedestrian, as he now goes quietly along the
gardens, fancies no harsher sound to have
been heard from  the Palace windows, than
the "tuning of the tea-things," or the sound
of a piano-forte.
 </p><p> We may thus, in imagination, see the
house and the gardens growing larger with
each successive proprietor.  First, there is
Heneage Finch, the Speaker of the House of
Commons, at the accession of Charles the


<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>
First; for he is the earliest occupant we can
discover. Speakers of the House of Commons,
naturally enough, rush to the nearest fresh air
they can find, after the heat and toil they
have undergone in that illustrious human
stew-pan. They did this the faster, when
the stew-pan was ridiculously small; which
it was, even up to the latest period of
the house which the Commons occupied
not many years ago; and this, in all probability, was the reason which carried
Heneage Finch to his sleeping quarters in
the Kensington Gravel Pits. This gentleman
possessed but fifteen acres of ground; which
his son, Sir Heneage Finch, afterwards Earl
of Nottingham, increased by a grant that
was made him out of Hyde Park. To the
Earl's son and heir, Daniel, succeeded King
William the Third, who bought the house
and grounds of Daniel, and enlarged them

      <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>

both, the latter to the extent of twenty-six
acres.  Anne added thirty acres; Queen
Caroline, wife of George the Second, added
three hundred; and the house, which had
been growing all this time, was finally
brought to its present size or appearance by the
late Duke of Sussex, who added or rebuilt the
rooms, with their still fresh-looking brickwork, that form the angle on the southwest.
 </p><p> No royal personage now lives in the
palace, unless we may so call the respected
Duchess of Inverness, whom   the Duke of
Sussex, by the good sense and liberality of
Queen Victoria, was allowed to marry morganatically, and who was presented, in consequence, with one of his Royal Highness's
titles. The apartments not occupied by her
Grace, are in possession of various gentlemen
and ladies, who formerly held office in the

<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>    .

household, or under government. There is
one great defect in their accommodation.
The house, nominally, possesses gardens
that are miles in circumference; but these
having  become public every day   in the
week, which in the early times of the
Georges was not the case, it has, in reality,
to any sequestered purpose of enjoyment,
no gardens at all, except at one corner.
 </p><p> The inmates must remain in-doors, or walk
in the public thoroughfare. Now a house
without a garden, is, to lovers of gardens,
but a kind of prison; and however arboraceous the look-out may be from the Palace
windows, or however welcome even the
sight of the passengers or promenaders may
be to such of the persons in doors as are
prevented from going out by illness or
infirmity, this consideration of their condition
is not pleasant to beholders.  It is impossible


   <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>

not to wish their comfort completed; nor do
we think such a thing impracticable, supposing they would prefer small shut-in
gardens to none at all.  There is room
enough for very pleasant bowers in the
spaces to the east and south, that are now
grassed and railed in from the public path;
nor would the look of the Palace be injured
with the spectator, but rescued from its
insipidity; garden walls with trees; by the
help of a little taste in their construction,
being capable of picturesqueness, and even
of architectural elegance.  Had enclosures
of this kind existed in the times of such
Ladies of the Bedchamber as Lady Suffolk,
or the Duchess of Somerset, the occupants would have built capital summerhouses in them.   Arbuthnot might have
had a berceau or pergola in one of them,
such as Le Sage delighted to walk up


<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>

and down in, while composing his Gil
Blas.
 </p><p> The gardens, in the time of the Finches,
consisted of little but the ground squaring
with the north side of the Palace, laid out in
the first formal and sombre style of our native
gardening, and originating the still existing
circle of yew trees, a disposition of things
congenial with the owners. Heneage Finch,
the Speaker, and his sons, the first and second
Earls of Nottingham, were all lawyers and
statesmen; and though a clever, and upon
the whole, a worthy, appear to have been a
melancholy race.  The first Earl suffered
under a long depression of spirits before he
died; the second was a man of so atrabilarious
a complexion, and such formal and dreary
manners, that he was nicknamed Dismal;
and Dismal's son, from a like swarthy appearance, and the way in which he neglected


    <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

his dress, was called the Chimney-sweep.
Hanbury Williams, the reigning lampooner of
the days of George the Second, designated
the whole race as the    "black  funereal
Finches."
 </p><p> These unusual "Finches of the Grove,"
made way for a kind of Jupiter's bird in the
eagle-nosed, hawk-eyed, gaunt little William the
Third; a personage as formal and melancholy
as themselves, though not so noisy (for Dismal,
notwithstanding his formality, was a great
talker); and under William, the Gardens
though they grew larger, did but exchange
English formality for Dutch.  The walks
became longer and straighter, like canals;
the yews were retained and clipped; there
was, perhaps, a less number of flowers, comparatively; for the English had always been
fond of flowers, and the Dutch had not yet
grown mad (commercially) for tulips; in


<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>

short, William the Third, with a natural love
for his Dutch home, made the palace and
gardens look as much like it as he could.
 </p><p>  And his Court, for the most part, was as
gloomy as the gardens; for William was not
fond of his new subjects; did not choose to
converse with them; and was seldom visible
but to his Dutch friends. Yet here were
occasionally to be seen some of the liveliest
wits and courtiers that have left a name in
history, forsakers, indeed, of reserved and despotic King James, rather than enthusiasts for
the equally reserved and hardly less power-
loving King William, who had become,
however, by the force of circumstances, the
instrument for securing freedom. Here came
the Earl of Dorset, Prior's friend, who had
been one of the wits of the Court of Charles
the Second; Prior himself, who had stirred
William's Dutch phlegm so agreeably, as to


      <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

be made one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber; Congreve, whose plays Queen Mary
admired; Halifax, a minor wit, but no mean
statesman; Sir William Temple, who combined public with private life to so high a
degree of wisdom and elegance ; Swift
(probably) then a young man, whom Sir
William made use of in his communications
with the king; Burnet, the gossiping historian, sometimes wrong-headed, but generally
right-hearted, whose officious zeal for the
Revolution had made him a bishop; the Earl
of Devonshire, whose nobler zeal had made him
a duke, one of a family remarkable for their
constant and happy combination of popular
politics with all the graces of their rank;
Lord Monmouth, afterwards the famous,
restless Earl of Peterborough, friend of Swift
and Pope, conqueror of Spain, and lover, at
the age of seventy, of Lady Suffolk; Sheffield,



<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>

afterwards Duke of Buckinghamshire, a minor
wit and poet, in love with (the rank of) the
Princess Anne; and last, not least, in anything
but good-breeding, and a decent command
over his passions, Peter the Great, semi-barbarian, the premature forcer of Russian
pseudo-civilisation, who came to England in
order to import the art of ship-building into
his dominions, in his own proper mechanical
person, and out of the five months which he
spent here, passed a good many days out of
one of them in interchanging visits with King
William at Kensington.  The Czar had a
house looking on the water in York-Buildings,
where, in entertaining one day his royal host
(for William supplied him with house and
everything else while in the kingdom) a
favourite monkey leaped angrily upon the
saturnine Dutchman, and produced so much
confusion, that the visit was chiefly taken

       <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>

up in apologising for the animal's misbehaviour.
 </p><p> Peter seems to have dined frequently at
Kensington; and it has been wondered how
the two sovereigns got on so well together.
But they held several predilections in common;
among which were unpolished manners, a dislike (in consequence) of being seen in society,
and a love of Dutch habits, particularly
gin and brandy drinking, the gin being chiefly
on the king's side, and the brandy, as the
greater stimulus, on the side of the Czar.
Sometimes he put pepper into it. William
took him from Kensington one day to the
House of Lords, where the uncouth Russian,
always shy of being seen, particularly by
"lords and gentlemen," made the lords and
king himself laugh by peeping strangely at
them out of a window in the roof.  He got
the same kind of sight at the House of



<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>

Commons; and even at a ball at Kensington,
on the Princess Anne's birth-day, he contrived
to be invisibly present in a closet prepared
for him on purpose, where he could see
without being seen. This was the man who,
when abroad, worked only in dockyards, and
when in his own country, paraded himself on
every possible occasion, serious or farcical. His
virtues were at home only among workmen,
and his vices among drunkards and executioners.
 </p><p> Another anecdote of Peter while in England, must not be omitted, it is so applicable
to the present time. He was one day, to
his wrath and astonishment, shouldered aside
in the street, by a porter, with so much
violence, as to be thrown into the kennel.
He was proceeding to take personal vengeance,
when Lord Carmarthen (who had been appointed his bear-leader) judiciously prevailed

   <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

on him to be quiet.  His Lordship thought
fit, at the same time, to give an angry rebuke
to the porter, asking him if he did not know
that " this was the Czar."  " Czar !" cried
the porter, who had the blood in him of the
future heroes of Balaclava; " We are all Czars
here."
 </p><p> Though William, however, was not very
visible in the palace of Kensington, after the
ordinary fashion of sovereign residents, his
memory, assisted by the Dutch fashion of the
house and grounds, has left a strong impression of itself upon the place. Here, meditating his campaigns against James the
Second and Louis the Fourteenth, or thinking
what he should do to get enough power out
of his grudging  English Parliament, the
sickly, asthmatic, but self-willed Dutchman,
was silent all day, and talkative at night, with
his countrymen, over his bottle of Hollands.


<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>

  </p><p>At Hampton Court, where he went on
Saturdays, and which place he also made as
Dutch as he could, he hunted, and felt
more at large; but here, at Kensington, when
not at St. James', or in the wars, he was
generally obliged to remain, for convenience
of business ; here his wife Mary, who, if of
an unfortunate, was of a loving race, studied
his every wish in vain, in hope to make him
love her as much as he did his mistress, the
Countess of Orkney, who squinted, but who,
in Swift's opinion, was the " wisest woman"
the Dean ever knew; here Mary, however,
did not waste away with her passion; for
she grew fatter and fatter every day, like her
sister Anne, till she became a "sight;" here
she died before William died; and here the
Anglo-Dutchman then discovered, or others
discovered, from his sighs and faintings away,
how fond he had been of her; here, lastly,

     <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>

he died himself, at the age of fifty-two, worn
out with a life of mingled ambition, patriotism, irritability, anxiety, physical weakness,
mental energy, and what, alas! was no proof
of the energy, the aforesaid drink of his
native country.
 </p><p> William was a great man, in a little, crazy
body, which thus conspired to level him with
the least. Some historians describe him as
tall, but his contemporary and courtier, Prior,
who could not have been mistaken on such
a point, characterizes him as
</p><p>
      <quote rend="blockquote"> Little Will, the scourge of France,
       No godhead, but the first of men.</quote>

 </p><p> He could hardly be called the scourge of
France. He was more of a thorn in her side
than a scourge; for he worried and obstructed, rather than beat her.  But he was
a great man, nevertheless, and understood



<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>
and secured the interests of Europe.  Party
rage accused him of sensuality and coldheartedness, carried to excesses horrible to
think of; one of which, the massacre at
Glencoe, if he really knew the truth of the
matter, which is still a question, would indeed
afford damning proof of the enormities to
which the doctrine of expediency could transport a man. The other charges would appear
to be disproved by the affecting evidences
which our latest and best historian, Mr.
Macaulay, has brought of the interest which
this saturnine-looking prince took in the
innocent pleasures and domestic felicity of
his particular friends and their families. Party
fury seems to have forgotten, that a readiness
to believe what is disgraceful, argues a disgraceful turn of mind in the believer.
 </p><p> The only distinct personal anecdote recorded of William the Third, in connexion

  <pb id="p.91" n="91"/>

with Kensington, is of the kind just mentioned, and will remind the reader of similar
paternal stories of Agesilaus and others.
 </p><p> A tap was heard, one day, at his closet
door, while his secretary was in attendance.
  </p><p>" Who is there ?" said the king.
 </p><p> "Lord Buck," answered the little voice of
a child of four years of age.  It was Lord
Buckhurst, the son of his Majesty's lord high
chamberlain, the Earl of Dorset.
 </p><p> "And what does Lord Buck want?" returned William, opening the door.
 </p><p>" You to be a horse to my coach," rejoined
the little magnate.  "I've wanted you a long
time."
 </p><p> William smiled upon his little friend, with
an amiableness which the secretary had never
before thought his countenance capable of
expressing, and "taking the string of the
toy in his hand, dragged it up and down the



<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>

long gallery till his playfellow was satisfied.
 </p><p> The Court and Gardens of Kensington
were not livelier in Queen Anne's time than
in that of King William. Anne, as we have
seen at Campden House, was a dull woman
with a dull husband. They had little to say
for themselves; their greatest pleasures were
in eating and drinking; the Queen was absurdly fond of etiquette; and as there was
nothing to startle decorum in the court
morals, the mistress in King William's time
had given something of a livelier stir to the
gossip.  Swift describes Anne in a circle of
twenty visitors as sitting with her fan in her
mouth, saying about three words once a
minute to some that were near her, and
then upon hearing that dinner was ready,
going  out.  In   the evening she played
at cards; which, long before, and afterwards,

       <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>

 was the usual court pastime at that
hour.
 </p><p> She does not appear to have been fond of
music, or pictures, or books, or anything but
what administered to the commonest animal
satisfactions, or which delivered her mind at
all other times from its tendency to irresolution
and tedium.
 </p><p> Addison and Steele might have been occasionally seen at her Kensington levees among
the Whigs; and Swift, Prior, and Bolingbroke
among the Tories.  Marlborough would be
there also; ever courtly and smiling, whether
he was victorious as general and as the favourite Duchess's husband, or only bowing
the more obsequiously alas ! for fear of losing
his place and his perquisites.  But the liveliest of all the royal scenes at this Palace,
though confined to two persons, must have
been  that  (had  there  been anybody to


<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>

witness it)  which  closed  the Duchess's
reign.
 </p><p> The reader may imagine it as he goes
along the Gardens, and looks up at its now
tranquil apartments.
 </p><p>  Sarah Jennings, afterwards Churchill,
Duchess of Marlborough, who was the
daughter of respectable but not rich parents,
had entered upon a court life at an early age
as one of the companions of Anne during
the Princess's girlhood.  The young lady
who, like Anne herself, was what is called a
fine girl, but handsomer, an advantage which
a flattered, self-complacent princess was less
likely to regard in that point of view, than
as an ornament to her establishment, possessed a flow of spirits, which her young
mistress was equally glad to welcome, as a
relief to her dullness.
 </p><p> The companion being politic and ambitious,
    <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

and not yet having had the worst points of
her character brought out by worldly greatness, filled the vacancy of the royal mind
with amusement, saved it trouble by deciding
for it in emergencies, and, in short, rendered
herself so useful and delightful, that Anne,
with the usual propensity of the Stuarts to
favourites, conceived a sort of passionate
friendship for her, as for a livelier self.  She
retained the fondness long after they were
both married; was not content till difference
of rank   was abolished between them   in
private  by the names of "Mrs. Morley
and  Mrs. Freeman;" and did not perceive all this while that she was converting
a subservient playmate into a dictatorial
scorner.
 </p><p> For years Anne laboured under a yoke
which at length a new and humbler favourite,
after many struggles, helped her to throw off;

<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>
and what completed the amazement and
fury of the Duchess at an event so unlooked
for, was that the supplanter, Abigail Hill
(the very name was that of servitude), had
been a creature of her own, and even a poor
relation, that wretchedest of all creatures in
the eyes of pride. The catastrophe, too, had
been brought about by one of the Duchess's
own mistakes; by a proposal emanating from
herself; and which was precisely the kind of
turning-point that suited the Queen's nature.
 </p><p> The Duchess had requested an interview-
a proposition the most alarming conceivable
to the poor Queen, on account of the advantage which her antagonist possessed in
powers of tongue.   She, therefore, parried
it as long as possible, and would evidently
have not assented at all, had not the Duchess
extorted the permission by stratagem. Unfortunately, however, for her success, she had
  <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>

told the Queen in a letter which preceded
it, that she only desired to be seen and be
heard by her Majesty. There was no necessity, she said, for the Queen to answer. The
Queen, in fact, had answered so many of her
tormentor's letters in the negative, that the
Duchess, not foreseeing what would be the
consequence of this general preclusion of
response in her Majesty's favour, was resolved
to prevent farther epistolary acknowledgment
by following up her last letter in person.
She says, in the foolish "Account" which
she gave to the world of her " Conduct," and
which had the reverse effect of what she
intended (which is the usual case with violent
relators of their own story):
  </p><p>" I followed this letter to Kensington, and
by that means prevented the Queen's writing
again to me, as she was preparing to do.


<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>

The page who went in to acquaint the Queen
that I was come to wait upon her, stayed
longer than usual; long enough, it is to be
supposed, to give time to deliberate whether
the favour of admission should be granted,
and to settle the measure of behaviour if I
were admitted. But, at last, he came out and
told me I might go in."
 </p><p> Poor Anne even now endeavoured to stop
the coming torrent of words, by recommending the Duchess to put what she had to say in
writing; but as this was the very thing over
which the latter thought she had triumphed,
she must have heard the proposal with contemptuous delight; and she proceeded accordingly to pour forth her complaints. The
Queen, after intimating that lies no doubt
were told on all sides, came to the beautiful
resource which had unwillingly been furnished

    <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

her, and said she would give the Duchess
"no answer."   The Duchess, astounded to
find herself caught in her own trap, and taken
at her word, declared, of course, that the
phrase was not intended to imply what it
did; but the Queen, she says, repeated it
again and again, " without ever receding."
 </p><p> The Duchess protested that her only
design was to clear herself.  The Queen
repeated over and over again, "You desired
no answer, and shall have none."
 </p><p> The Duchess fell into " great disorder,"
and into floods of tears; but still the only
return was: " You desired no answer, and
you shall have none."
 </p><p> "I then begged to know, if her Majesty
would tell me some other time ?"
 </p><p> "You desired no answer, and you shall
have none."


<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>

  </p><p>"I then appealed to her Majesty again,
if she did not herself know, &amp;c. And whether
she did not know me to be of a temper
incapable of, &amp;c., &amp;c."
  </p><p>" You desired no answer, and you shall
have none."
  </p><p>"This usage," concludes the Duchess,
" was so severe, and these words, so often
repeated, were so shocking, &amp;c., that I could
not conquer myself, but said the most disrespectful thing I ever spoke to the Queen
in my life; and that was, that I was confident
her Majesty would suffer for such an instance
of inhumanity."
  </p><p>The Queen answered, "that will be to
myself."
  </p><p>"And thus ended," says the Duchess,
"this remarkable conversation, the last I
ever had with her Majesty."

    <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>

 </p><p> Exit the loud tongue of the Duchess of
Marlborough; Abigail Hill, now Mrs. Masham, has a good rejoicing chat with her
mistress; and for the rest of Queen Anne's
reign, Kensington Palace would seem to have
been as dull and as quiet as the more advanced
years of her Majesty could desire. Whigs
and Tories, it is true, contended in it for
possession of her favour; and the conflict is
supposed to have embittered her last moments, which here took place; yet, at all
events, there was no Duchess of Marlborough,
and no noise.
 </p><p> And the outside was as dull as the in.
Anne enlarged the Gardens, but she did not
improve the style of gardening.  Addison,
in a paper of the " Spectator," written during
the last year but one of her reign, catching
at the least glimpse of a variation, speaks

<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>

with rapture of the conversion of a disused
gravel-pit, which had been left remaining,
into a cultivated dell; but it would seem as
if this exploit on the part of the gardeners
was rather in the hope of making the best
of what they considered a bad thing, than
intended as an advance towards something
better; for they laid out the Queen's additional acres in the same formal style as
King William's.
 </p><p> Long, straight gravel-walks, and clipped
hedges, prevailed throughout, undiversified
with thepresent mixture of freer growing wood.
An alcove or two, still existing, were added;
and Anne, exerted herself so far as to build
a long kind of out-house, which still remains;
and which she intended, it is said, for the
balls and suppers which certainly took place
in it; though we suspect, from the narrowness

   <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>

  of its construction, it never was designed for anything but what it is, a
 green-house.
 </p><p>  These most probably constituted all those
 "elegancies of art," with which a writer of
 the time gives her credit for improving the
 Gardens. Such, at any rate, was the case in
 the more public portions of them; and if
 the private ones enjoyed any others, we may
 guess what they were, from Pope's banter of
the horticultural fashions of the day, in a
paper which he contributed to the "Guardian," the year after the appearance of that
of Addison's in the "Spectator."    The
following is a taste of them. The poet is
giving a catalogue of plants that were to be
disposed of by auction:
 </p><p> "Adam   and Eve in yew; Adam a little
  shattered by the fall of the Tree of Knowledge



<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>
in the great storm; Eve and  the
Serpent very flourishing.
 </p><p> " St. George, in box; his arm scarce long
enough, but will be in a condition to stick
the Dragon, by next April.
</p><p>  "An old Maid of Honour, in wormwood.
 </p><p> " A topping Ben Jonson, in laurel.
 </p><p> " A quick-set hog, shot up into a porcupine, by its being forgot a week in rainy
weather."
 </p><p> The " old Maid of Honour, in wormwood"
might have told the little satirist, that he
was an old bachelor in stinging-nettle.
  </p><p>Maids of Honour, we take it, have never
been very famous for growing old. Their
maiden state has generally passed into that
of Ladies of the Bed-chamber, whether royal
or otherwise. They were by no means in
their sprightliest condition during the reign

     <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>

Anne; and yet it is at Kensington in
that day, that, for the first time since the
reign of Charles the Second, we again meet
   with particular mention of the sisterhood.

<p>  THE institution of Maids of Honour, or
something like it-great stars, or "sparklers"

     <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>

  (to use a term of that day) in this
 royal suburb of Kensington, must have been
 as ancient as that of royalty; but, with the
 exception of some passages in the reign of
 Henry the Eighth, and Mary, Queen of
 Scots, they can hardly be said to have made
 their appearance in this country, till the times
 of Grammont and Mr. Pepys.       The first
 one of distinction that we meet with in
Eaglish history, is Philippa Roet, daughter
of Sir Payne Roet, wife of our great poet
Chaucer, and sister of Katherine Swynford,
who first became mistress, and afterwards
wife, to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.
Katherine, who had been in the service of
the Duke's first Duchess, had, perhaps, borne
the title of Maid of Honour, as well as her
sister; John of Gaunt having been titular
King of Castile.



<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>
 </p><p> Courts, owing to the temptations they
naturally create, and the proportionate necessity of counteracting the temptations, are
places either of strict decorums, or of unusual
licence. The titular king was probably less
"particular" in his court, than Edward the
Third his father was (at that time) in his;
and these two ladies may be said to shadow
forth all the subsequent histories of maidens
in the service of royalty. When we hear
little or nothing of them, all goes well. The
more their career becomes public, the less
advantageous it is to their repute.
 </p><p> On the other hand, while some of the
staidest reputations were probably undeserved,
some of those the most shaken may have
as little merited their ill fortune. We are
not to take for granted that the two out of
the four Maids of Honour who had the misfortune

   <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>

 to become wives of Henry the Eighth
deserved the imputations for which that disgusting mass of debauchery and brutality
had the impudence to send them to the
block. There is reason to suspect, that the
staidest-looking of the four, Jane Seymour,
was the least worthy of them all, as being
the most heartless; and there is evidence to
prove that the numerous Marys, who became
celebrated in the court of their name-sake,
Mary, Queen of Scots, were not, for the
most part, if not altogether, more sinned
against than sinning, in the censorious records
of John Knox and others. Some of them,
it is true, like Anne Bullen, had been bred
in the court of France; and as no courts at
that time had been paragons of propriety,
ill constructions of the best of a set of lively
damsels were easy; but some of Mary's


<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>
maidens evinced so much good-heartedness
towards her during her troubles, that to
think the worst of them became a vice; and
whatever privilege might have been assumed
by " Knocking Jack of the North " (as Swift
called him), for calumniating all natures but
his own, there remains a sharp reckoning
to be come to by posterity with saints of his
description, who beg all sorts of questions
on the side of one kind of extreme, till they
drive nations, out of melancholy desperation,
into another.
 </p><p> We know not what assured evils would
have resulted to  Scotland, had Mary and
her Maids of Honour been suffered to dance
and play their guitars in peace; but it is
certain that John Knox was the founder of
the whiskey-shops.
 </p><p> We have little respect for "gallantries,"

  <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>

as substitutes for love; very little indeed;
almost as little as for the "legalized prostitutions," which so often drive people into
them.   But we respect, least of all, the
inhuman superstitions, and their sottish consequences, which can desecrate gallantry
itself, even in its lowest forms; which occasion all kinds of hypocrisy and evil-speaking;
and give rise to successions of dull and
melancholy generations, that ought never to
have been born.
 </p><p> But we must take care how we digress
into a history of Maids of Honour.  Swift,
or his friend Arbuthnot, proposed such a
work, in the reign to which we have now
arrived; and, with the tyranny too common
to wits, he seems to have been surprised and
displeased at finding the project not relished
by its intended victims.



<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>
 </p><p> "Arbuthnot," says he, in one of his letters
to Stella, dated  17th  September,  <date value="1711">1711</date>,
" made me draw up a sham subscription for
a book, called a 'History of the Maids of
Honour, since Henry the Eighth;' showing
how they make the best wives; with a list of
all the Maids of Honour since, &amp;c.; to pay
a crown in hand, and t'other crown upon
delivery of the book; and all in the common
form of these things. We got a gentleman
to write it fair, because my hand is known;
and we sent it to the Maids of Honour, when
they came to supper. If they bite at it, 'twill
be a very good court-jest; and the Queen
will certainly have it."
  </p><p>But, on the 5th of the month ensuing,
he says, "Mrs. Forester" (one of the Maids:
it was the custom in those days to call unmarried as well as married ladies, mistress)

     <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>

"taxed me yesterday, about the 'History of
the Maids of Honour ;' but I told her it was
no jest of mine; for I found they did not
relish it altogether well: and I have enough
already of a quarrel with that brute, Sir
John Walters, who has been railing at me in
all companies, ever since I dined with him;
(telling them) that I abused the Queen's meat
and drink, and said nothing at the table was
good, andall a d-d lie; for, after dinner,
commending the wine, I said I thought it
was something small."
 </p><p> How this was "commending" the wine,
the Dean does not inform   us.  We hear
nothing further of the proposed History;
and little is known of her Majesty's Maids
of Honour, except that they found the Court
tiresome, and their rides with the Queen
fatiguing. Anne considered exercise imperatively


<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>
 necessary to her great dinners and
suppers, and her chocolate on going to bed;
and as her corpulence prevented recourse to
horseback, she had a chaise invented for her
with great safety-wheels, in which, after
having secured her own life and limbs from
danger, she went pelting like a female
Nimrod after a poor stag, who was thus to
break his heart with fatigue and terror, in
order to enable her Majesty to eat too much.
For, that is the object on such occasions.
The plea is, health and a reasonable appetite;
but the result is, just enough health to encourage repletion, and make fat fatter. A
revolting spectacle must that great fat woman
have been, scourging and driving after the
poor panting stag.
  </p><p>It was not till the next reign, that the
Maids of Honour came full again into bloom;

    <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>

and this was not due to George the
First, who had left a divorced queen in
Germany, but to his son, the prince of
Wales,  afterwards  George  the Second;
whose   wife,  Caroline  of  Anspach, a
sprightly  woman herself, got a congenial
set of young ladies about her, who are
famous to this day.
 </p><p> George the First, Elector of Hanover, who
succeeded to the throne of these kingdoms
as the next Protestant heir of Anne's Popish
relations, had parted with his queen in
Germany (Sophia Dorothea, of Zell) and
even contrived to lock her up for life, on an
allegation, never proved, of her infidelity with
Count Koningsmark, brother of the Count
Koningsmark, who assassinated Mr. Thynne
in the hope of depriving him of a wealthy
bride.



<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>
 </p><p> George's own life, meantime, and ever
afterwards, with  the usual   injustice  of
his sex, was full of license. He was a short,
round-featured, ease-loving, selfish, dull man;
not ill-natured, where he was not thwarted,
but capable otherwise of hating stubbornly
enough, as he did in the instances both of
his wife and his son; the latter, perhaps, for
some supposed   likeness to Koningsmark,
which was long a jest against the Hanover
succession, with the partizans of the house of
Stuart. George could not speak English;
never cared to learn it; cared, in fact, for
nothing but his ease, and his German diversions;-that is to say, for his old habits,
whatever they were; and, fortunately, for the
English nation, he put its government, and
its security from the Stuarts, into the hands
of Sir Robert Walpole, who, if he was a
     <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>

corrupt minister in regard to money, certainly
applied the corruption to the maintenance
of the best interests of the country.  George
brought over two mistresses with him from
Germany; one, the Duchess of Kendal,
dismally thin; the other, the Countess of
Darlington, overflowingly corpulent; both of
them the scorn and jest of the nation,
whom they fleeced in return. They were
both also as dull as himself; and, lawless as
they were, occasioned no sort of vivacity in
the court. Before he died (which was not
at Kensington, or in England, but during one
of his visits to Germany) George added to
the seraglio which he is supposed to have
gathered about him, an English damsel of
the name of Brett, daughter of Savage's
mother, the Countess of Macclesfield; and
such a daughter, black-browed and bold, as



<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>

such a mother might be supposed to have
given birth to. Establishments of this kind,
begun by the kings of France, had spread
over Europe, as a fashion, and a matter of
course; and thus acquired a sort of privileged
allowance.
 </p><p> The unprincely, reserved, insignificant-
looking Elector of Hanover was not fond of
appearing before his new subjects. Kensington Gardens, therefore, remained with
him as dull and limited as he found them;
and his son, who was always at variance with
him, appeared at the court there as little as
he could help. Yet it is during the reign
of George the First, that the fashionable
promenades in the gardens, which became so
popular, and the last glittering skirts of
which are still within the memories of old
people, would seem to have first made their
        <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>

appearance.   Caroline  of Anspach, the
Prince of Wales's consort, probably gave
rise to them, when she came with her bevy
of maidens to court. People would throng
to see them; the ladies would take the
opportunity of showing themselves in the
walks; persons of fashion, privileged to
enter the Gardens, would avail themselves of
the privilege, and at last the public would
obtain admission, and the show be complete.
The full promenade, it seems, was at first
confined to Saturdays.  It was afterwards
changed to Sundays, and continued so till
the custom went out with the closing days of
George the Third.
  </p><p>But we must leave mistresses and Maids
of Honour awhile.
 </p><p> The poets of the time now began to sing
of Kensington Gardens. Addison's friend,

<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>

Tickell, leading the way. His poem, indeed,
under that title, though, like the court wine,
it was " something small," had real merits of
fancy and elegance, and by the help of a
catholic taste, which rejects nothing that
has flavour at all, may still be read with
gratification.  There is even  a story in
the poem, not destitute of invention, and
so very local, that, before proceeding further, we are bound to give some account
of it.
 </p><p> Tickell informs us that, in the earliest
times of those princes who gave their name
of Albion to this island, and who were descended on the mother's side from Neptune, the
ground now occupied by Kensington Gardens
contained the capital and the palace of the
English Kingdom of the Fairies. The walks
were their streets, full of such houses as

   <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>

fairies live in; and on the spot in which
Queen Anne's gardeners made the dell which
disappeared not long ago, stood the palace of
the elfin King Oberon.
 </p><p> A prince of the human royal family is
stolen in his infancy by one of these fairies,
and kept down as much as possible to the
standard of his new associates, by a diet of
daisy-roots and dwarf elder-berries.  His
nurse, however, cannot hinder him, as he
grows up, from surpassing them in height to
the amount of two inches; and this, and his
other attractions, have such an effect on
Kenna, a beautiful fairy princess, from whom
the neighbouring town is named, that they are
inspired with a mutual passion. This they
vow to one another under the shade of a
tulip, at " dead of day," when they suppose
all other fairies to be asleep; and Kenna has


<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>

just sworn that she will never wed a prince of
her own race, when King Oberon starts up
by their side in a fury, summons a hundred
of his attendants to drive away the mortal
prince, and bids his despairing relative prepare to marry Azuriel, a fairy only less than
royal, whose mansion stood on the site of the
present Holland House.
 </p><p> A war now ensues between the elfin and
the human royalties, the latter assisted by a
fairy chief, jealous of Azuriel. Prince Albion
(for the lover possessed the name of his line)
invokes the aid of his dread ancestor Neptune, but not having the patience to wait
for it, joins battle, and is slain.  Neptune,
at this, overlooking the lover's fault in his
misfortune, rouses himself in final indignation.
His chariot shoots him from the sea into the
Thames, in a roaring whirlwind. One stride

    <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>

 on  land  brings him   into " Brumpton;"
 another passes the conquerors on the field of
 battle into their unsuspecting capital. The
 God thrusts his trident underneath    their
 houses, raises the whole city on the fork of
 it, as he would a clod of earth, and,
 making a dreadful shadow of it as it descends on the horrified conquerors, mashes
 them and their empire for ever, at a blow.
Kenna, unable to restore Albion to life,
changes him into a snowdrop, a flower which,
Tickell informs the botanists, first grew on
the site of Kensington Gardens, and is sacred
to "virgins;" that is to say, to Maids of
Honour. As to the Gardens themselves, they
were the creation of the same loving fairy.
She, at least, pleased, when British monarch
took possession of the place, to see the line
of her lover's house reigning on the spot,




<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>
suggested to the brain of Mr. Wise, the gardener, in a morning dream, a topiary
following out of the plan of the ancient city,
in the disposition of his " allies green." The
walls and streets, in his hedges of yew, he

 </p><p>  So to this day, to this very moment of the
enlightened and utilitarian nineteenth century,
and in spite, or rather in aid, of the effects of
the utilitarian steam-carriages that shake the
air at midnight in thePaddington and Surrey
distances (for what can be more fairy-like and
marvellous, if we consider their first causes,
than those?) the eyes of the fancies of all
such persons as choose to see them (and we
confess our own to be of the number) may

still behold the fairies, on moonlight nights,
dancing their rounds in Kensington Gardens,
with their faithful princess at their head, to the
eternal honour of love, and the virgin snowdrops, and the reigning house of Albion.
We think we see them    now, while we are
writing, gathering like fire-flies among the
trees; skimming like swallows over the pond
in front of the Palace; careering like doves
round the Palace roof; going in procession,
like mourning widows, to the sound of a
feeble choir; gliding in a chain of whirling
but grave-faced dancers with dishevelled hair;
then, as if relieving themselves after those
tragical reminiscences, imitating the graces
and the follies that at different times have
been developed by the events reigning in the
Palace; coming down the Great Walk in a
flood of hoops and other court-dresses, (see

       <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>

the close of the chapter) in a style, and with
a blaze of colours that might have made the
"human mortals" die with envy; beating
opera dancers in operatic dances, which end
with whirring flights into the air like frightened
coveys of birds; fantastically caricaturing
(at least such among them as are

      <quote rend="blockquote">"The pert fairies, and the dapper elves.")

the absurdities of the Chesterfields, Horace
Walpole, Duchesses of Marlborough and
Kingston, &amp;c., or forcing the actual and
reluctant ghosts of those worthies to do it
themselves; pursuing the wretched spectre
of Lord Hervey with pop-guns made
of his own quills, and paper-pellets of
his own pages, while the blushing shades of
Queen Caroline, and her daughter Caroline,


<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>
look and shake their heads at him; then
turning themselves all at once for refreshment into living parterres and flower-beds of
the most gorgeous description, that breathe
forth delighted sighs of pink and sweet-briar;
tuning the winds into harmonies beyond
AEolian lyres; lighting the windows of the
Palace on the birth-night of the Sovereign
who was born there, with flame and colours
beyond gas and jewellery; or forming themselves into figures of rose and lily, representing the letters of her name, and drawing it
across the Palace front, till all the place is
lit up with a radiance which is at once light
and odour.
 </p><p> But we must have done; or semi-utilitarian
readers, who do not know what crowning use
there is in uselessness, will think us really
benighted.

         <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>

   </p><p> To return, therefore, to flesh and blood-
Tickell's poem commences with a picture of
the early Kensington promenades, justly
painted in chintz and damask.
</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">  Where Kensington, high o'er the neigb'ring lands,
    'Midst greens and sweets, a regal fabrick stands,
    And sees each spring, luxuriant in her bowers,
    A snow of blossoms and a wild of flowers,
    The dames of Britain oft in crowds repair
    To groves and lawns, and unpolluted air.
    Here, while the town in damps and darkness lies,
    They breathe in sunshine, and see azure skies:
    Each walk, with robes of various dies bespread,
    Seems from afar a moving tulip-bed,
    Where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow
    And chintz, the rival of the showery bow.

    "Here England's Daughter, darling of the land,</quote>
</p><p>
(Caroline above-mentioned, to wit).
</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">    Sometimes, surrounded with her virgin band,
    Gleams through the shades. She, towering o'er the

<pb id="p.130" n="130"/>
   Stands fairest of the fairer kind confess'd;
   Form'd to gain hearts that Brunswick cause denied
   And charm a people to her father's side."</quote>

 </p><p>  Caroline was a fine-looking woman, with
a red and white complexion, and popular
manners.   It was rather bold in the poet
to call a foreign Princess of Wales, "England's Daughter."  Could the "father " have
read the verses (for though he had inherited
the English throne, the English language
was unknown to him) he would have been
anything but pleased with this ascription of
his popularity to his son's wife; for he
included her so strongly in his dislike of that
gentleman, that he was in the habit of calling
her " that devil, the Princess " or, (to use the
rhyming French formula, which somehow
or other had got into his head): "Cette diablesse, Madame la Princesse."

      <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>

  </p><p>  The "virgin band" over whom Caroline
 thus came towering along the Kensington
 walks, consisted of the snowdrops aforesaid,
 her Maids of Honour; and these remain
 famous to the present moment in the pages
 of Pope, Gay, and others. The reader may
 see them all at once, and make their intimate
 acquaintance, in the "Suffolk  Correspondence," where they laugh and talk as freely
 they did vivd voce;      and very startling
to modern ears the talk sometimes is. They
are not all 'in their maiden state in the
" Correspondence." Some have married; but
none have lost their vivacity. There is Miss
Hobart, the sweet-tempered and sincere (now
become Mrs. Howard, afterwards Lady Suffolk); Miss Howe, the giddiest of the giddy
(which  she lived  to lament);  Margaret
Bellenden, who vied in height with her royal



<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>

mistress; the beautiful Mary Bellenden, her
sister, who became Duchess of Argyle; Mary
Lepell, the lovely, who became Lady Hervey;
and Anne Pitt, sister of the future Lord
Chatham, whom we have seen in these
pages before (" as like him as two drops
of fire.") Most of these ladies, with other
promenaders of the day, may be seen personally coming forward as if down the
walks, in Gay's "Welcome (to Pope) from
Greece :"

  </p><p> Addison, it is observable, is not mentioned
 in these lines addressed by Gay to Pope.
 He is omitted, because he was supposed to
 grudge Pope his success, and, perhaps, for
 a reason connected with Gay himself, which
 has been alluded to in our chapters on Holland House.  But Addison must frequently
have been in the Gardens.  He watched
their improvements: he was a great admirer
of George the First; and the "Spectator"
shows what attention he paid to the moods
and manners of the other sex.  Swift, in a
moment of spleen with that work, says he
shall attend to it no longer, though Addison
"fair-sex it" as much as he pleases.  The
fans and furbelows in the Gardens, to use
a phrase of that time, must have been " prodigiously"



<pb id="p.138" n="138"/>
 on their good behaviour, whenever
they saw Addison coming up the walks.
Instead of Addison, we had written the
" Spectator;" but though most of the pages
in the " Spectator," were of his production,
the " Spectator" himself, in propria persona,
was its originator, Steele: and Steele, the
ladies would not comparatively have cared
for.  They knew they had him too much at
their command.   " Captain" Steele, coming
up the walk, though far more acceptable as
the admirer, was much less formidable as the
censor.
  </p><p>Garth, also, would have been here, and
Vanbrugh. Farquhar had died young, in the
time of Anne.  Even Voltaire might have
been seen in the Gardens, paying compliments to his acquaintance, Miss Lepell, who
was of French origin; for he was in England

     <pb id="p.139" n="139"/>

during the reign of George the First
(who patronized him); the future Queen
Caroline busied herself in procuring subscriptions for his "Henriadc," which was
published on this side of the water; and it
was not in the nature of any Frenchman,
much less of a wit and poet, like Voltaire,
to omit visiting a place of public resort,
where pleasant intercourse was to be met
with, and ladies to be admired.  He could
even have complimented them in their
own language, had he found     them  coy
as to speaking in his; for he made himself
so well acquainted with English, that he
wrote in it a book upon the nation, and,
among other persons, addressed some English
verses to the fair friend above mentioned-
then become Lady Hervey--which, for their
neatness and finish, are not unworthy the


<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>
compliments of a similar kind, which he was
in the habit of pouring forth to his acquaintances. And the reader may see that the
English is really his own, from the employment of the word power as a dissyllable; a
thing rarely done by a native writer, and
which certainly would never have been done
in the place where it is put.

  </p><p>There is no end, we confess, of supposing
who might or might not have made their
appearance in Kensington Gardens at some

        <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>

time or another; but we think it will be
admitted that this hypothesis respecting Voltaire has every probability on its side.  And
full as much may be assumed respecting the
most of the French painters of that time
(though he was a Fleming), Watteau-the
glorifier of gardens par excellence, that is
to say, of artificial gardens; of well-bred
groves and glades, where the trimmer had
been with his shears, and ladies and gentlemen assembled to play at shepherd and shepherdess in groups full of silk and embroidery-a Golden Age, after the pattern
of the Regent, Duke of Orleans.  Watteau,
however, had a great deal of merit as an
artist; was a companionable    man; and
painted the ideal of an actual state of things,
such as it was-pleasant, on canvass, at all
events, and not to be omitted in comprehensive



<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>

 galleries. Watteau came to England
in order to consult Dr. Mead on the state of
his health; and he remained here a twelve-
month; but died on his return, still young.
Kensington Gardens most unquestionably
saw him.</p>

   <p>GEORGE THE FIRST would seldom be visible
 in these promenades.    George the Second, a
man shorter than his short father, but smart,
strutting, decided-looking, with higher features,



<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>

 and an underhanging jaw, was fond of
being seen; and in all probability not seldom
paraded the gardens, amidst avenues of bows
and curtseys. Though by no means the
conjuror for which he took himself, he was a
less dull, though hardly better informed man
than his father; had the same instinctive
wisdom of self-security, which led to the
putting and maintaining the government in
the hands of Sir Robert Walpole; was
nevertheless the same petty German autocrat,
ruling, as far as he ruled at all, like a
martinet and a barrack-master; thought men
and women (according to the report of Lady
Mary) born for nothing else, but to be
"kicked or kissed for his diversion;" and
whenever one of the ladies gave him to
understand that she differed with him on that
point, he fancied that she only wanted an

 <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>

excuse for getting out of him a little of what
he valued above all things-money. He one
day counted his guineas so often for this
purpose, in the presence of Miss Bellenden,
that she told him "if he did it again, she
should go out of the room." He appears,
on a subsequent occasion, to have done it
again; upon which, the disgusted beauty
gave a jerk to the rouleau that scattered the
guineas about the floor, and ran off while he
was picking them up.
  </p><p>George's strutting airs of dignity were
but disguises of the want of it. Lady Deloraine, who was governess of his children,
and at the same time supposed to be one of
his mistresses, had her chair pulled from
under her one evening at Kensington by the
Princess Emily, as she was going to sit down
to cards.  Her ladyship sprawled on the



<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>

floor; and his dignified majesty did not
scruple to be very much diverted, and laugh.
The Countess, in return, contrived without
more ado to play him the same trick; and
his dignity was so offended, that a rupture
ensued between them, and she was forbidden
the Court.
  </p><p>George the Second, like his father, had
two chief mistresses; one of them a German,
of the name of Walmoden, whom he made
Countess of Yarmouth; the other, the Countess of Suffolk before-mentioned; both of
them well-tempered, discreet women, who
appear to have been as much the favourites
of his sober hours, or more so, than of the
impassioned moments for which credit was
given them. His chief passion had been for
his wife; and Sir Robert Walpole showed a
rare knowledge of a little-suspected, but no
    <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>

less certain corner in human nature, by discovering, that the wife retained an ascendancy over the mistresses by setting her husband's pleasure above every other consideration, and so possessing his unbounded
confidence. It was a curious instance of the
sentiments of those times; at least, in courts;
but Caroline of Anspach had been bred up
in them, and she carried their toleration to
an amount that was perhaps unequalled,
especially among those who most availed
themselves of the license. This was the
reverse of her own case, for she seems to
have been as faithful as she was devoted;
and her husband passionately said of her,
after her death, that he had never loved any
woman as he did her.
 </p><p> One of the proofs of Caroline's considering her husband's wishes above all things,


<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>

was her going a hunting with him in a
chaise, like Queen Anne, though she was in
a state of health which must have rendered
it more painful to her embonpoint, than it
was to that of the dull female Nimrod, her
precursor.  Another proof, still greater, was
her putting her gout-swollen legs into cold
water, in order to enable her to accompany
her husband in his walks; a dangerous
excess of conjugality, which, perhaps, helped
to kill her. Caroline's enemies, including a
false friend and servile worshipper, of whom
more anon, attributed all this self-denial to
the desire of secretly ruling where she seemed
to do nothing but obey. How could they
tell? or if they could tell in part, why was
that kind of ascendancy to be a vice in her,
which a poet (no friend of hers) proclaimed
to be a virtue in others, and which could

    <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>

never enter the head but of a loving or a
generous nature, whatever were the faults of
its breeding ?
</p><p>
  <quote rend="blockquote">"Oh  bless'd with temper, whose unclouded ray
  Can make to-morrow cheerful as to-day;
    She who can love a sister's charms, or hear
    Sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear;
    She who ne'er answers till a husband cools,
    Or if she rules him, never shows she rules;
    Charms by accepting, by submitting sways,
    Yet has her humour most when she obeys."
</quote>
 </p><p> There is a curious reference in a lampoon
of the time, to Caroline's habit of walking
with her husband, and her not being able to
walk so fast, which as it has a relation to
the gardens before us, shall here be repeated.
Swift, who was in opposition to the Court,
thought it very good; and it is not unamusing.    "The    great river Euphrates" is


<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>

the poor Serpentine, Caroline's creation out
of ponds; and the king's repetitions of his
words, "Who be ye, who be ye ? &amp;c.," looks
like the origin of a personal peculiarity of
his grandson, George the Third. The jeu-
d'esprit is headed: " Supposed to be written
on account of three gentlemen being seen in
Kensington Gardens by the King and Queen
while they were walking." It was thought
to be the production of Pulteney or Chesterfield, Walpole's opponents; and two of the
gentlemen were probably themselves, the
third being Wyndham or Bolingbroke, also
his opponents.
 </p><p> "Now   it came to pass in the days of
Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, in the
eighth month, in the sixth year of the King,
in the beginning of hay-harvest, that the
King and Queen walked arm-in-arm in the

 <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>

gardens which they had planted on the banks
of the river, the great river Euphrates; and,
behold, there appeared on the sudden three
men, sons of the giants; then Nebuchadnezzar, the King, lifted up his voice and
cried: 'Oh, men of war, who be ye, who be
ye? and is it peace?' But they answered
him not. Then spake he, and said: 'There
is treachery, oh my Queen, there is treachery;'
and he turned his face and fled. Now when
the Queen had seen what had befallen my
Lord the King, she girt up her loins and fled
also, crying, 'Oh, my God!' So the King
and the Queen ran together; but the King
outran her mightily; for he ran very
swiftly, neither turned he to the right hand
nor to the left, for he was sore afraid
where no fear was, and fled when no man
pursued."

<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>

  </p><p>The amount of the fact, we suppose, was,
that the King and Queen saw the three mortal
enemies of their minister coming, one day,
up the walk; and the King, in his impatience,
not choosing to await their salutations as
they passed him, turned about: for Walpole
at that time (it was in the year <date value="1738">1738</date>), was
in one of his most trying situations, and, not
long afterwards, resigned.
 </p><p> We return to the pleasanter subject of the
promenades. When the King and Queen
appeared in them, their majesties may have
been accompanied by a whole bevy of Princesses, their daughters. Their brother Frederick, Prince of Wales, would, however, be
seldom there, difference between father and
son being hereditary amongst the Georges.
The Kensington Garden promenades were
popular throughout the whole of the three

     <pb id="p.153" n="153"/>

  Georges' reigns, but flourished most, as far
  as names and fashions are concerned, in
  those of the first and second, beginning with
  the persons above mentioned and with the
  brocades and chintzes of Tickell's Poem, and
  terminating with the Miss Gunnings, Miss
  Chudleigh, Lady Townshend, Lord Chesterfield, Selwyn, Horace Walpole, and others.
The space of time includes half a century;
and  Walpole, Lady Suffolk, Beau Nash, and
Colley Cibber, lived through it all; the two
last from a much earlier period, and Walpole
  into a much later one, down to the French
  Revolution. At the beginning of it, Lady
  Mary Wortley Montague, with the wits of
  the Kit-Cat club about her, may be considered
  as having been the reigning belle of the
  promenaders; to her, succeeded the Bellendens and Lepells, with the same wits grown


<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>
older; then came Lady Townshend, with the
new wits, Horace Walpole, Selwyn, Hanbury
Williams, and others; and then crowds were
alternately drawn by the "Chudleigh" and
the Miss Gunnings; the former, for the adventures related at the beginning of this
work; the latter, for perfections of face
and figure, which sometimes rendered the
crush to get a sight of them positively dangerous.  So, at least, it is said; and the
reader may believe it, when he hears, that
there seems to have been a contest among
the nobility, who should obtain them for
wives.  They had no fortunes; but one
married an earl, and the other two dukes in
succession.  Miss Chudleigh, also, as we
have seen, had her earl and her duke.
Both  the  Gunnings died   young.   One
of them was the Countess of Coventry,


                  <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

 on whom Mason wrote some of his best
 verses.
</p><p>



</p><p>
  <quote rend="blockquote">Yes, Coventry is dead. Attend the strain,
        Daughters of Albion; ye, that light as air,
      So oft have tripp'd in her fantastic train,

   <quote rend="blockquote"> Whene'er with soft serenity she smil'd,
       Or caught the orient blush of quick surprise,

</quote>
</p><p>Mason, who      was a   bustling   man, and
became a court-chaplain, was probably often
in   the Gardens.       Not so his friend     Gray,
whose habits were recluse, and who soon tired



<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>

of what is called the world. But there came
Garrick to look after the fashionable dancer,
Mademoiselle Violette, whom he married;
there Cibber, before him, to study fops; and
there, curiously enough, the sentimental
Richardson, to study Cibber; whom he took
for the type of a man of fashion. Richardson, with all his moral punctilio, and his
inculcations to young ladies to keep at home,
was a great walker in public places, and
observer of pretty ancles.  He says, that, in
looking at a lady, he always began " with the
feet." This seems odd in a worshipper of
Clarissa Harlowe.  It helps, however, to
account for Lovelace.
 </p><p> The reader must fancy the Kensington
Garden promenaders, during this long lapse
of time, waxing and waning through almost
all the vicissitudes of wigs, coats, cocked-hats,

    <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>

and hoop-petticoats; for, with the exception
of the full-bottomed peruke of the second
Charles and James, this was the great period
of the reign of those habiliments.   The
gentlemen began with the full-bottomed
peruke in the time of George the First; went
into the various modes of bag-wigs, and bobs,
and cocked-hats; and changed their coats
from ugly to uglier, but all of the same
stiff race, with narrow shoulders, and broad
hips and skirts, their swords being retained
to show that the narrow shoulders belonged
to men. The short-tailed coat that was in
ascendancy not long ago, with its wretched
snipped horse-collar, was the worst and
most degenerate offspring of these coats;
for it was made as spare as possible, and had
not even colour to speak of; whereas, its
predecessors were at least ample in the skirts

     <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>

as the names of sacks and negligees survive
to testify. They might seem too much like
bed-gowns; or, at least, gowns unlaced.
And the bosom, in general, would be thought
too much exposed. But the walking-dress,
besides being more careful in that respect,
showed an opposite extreme of tightness in
the stays, while its skirts carried a weight of
flounce and furbelow.   Tory  and  Whig
ladies, during the disputes about the Hanover
succession, patched at one another in beautyspots, differently arranged; and the white
rose of the Pretender was sometimes ventured
in public, on the bosom of the fair partizan.
But the great glory of the whole period,
with the exception of a brief interval, was
the hoop. This Spanish invention (for such
it is supposed to have been, and which
originated perhaps in some royal dropsy, or



<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>
and sleeves, and the whole suit of clothes
blazed out, whether in good taste or otherwise,
in silks and velvets, in reds, greens, and gold
lace. Colour was, at all events, respected,
and dress not grudged its proper dimensions.
  </p><p>The ladies, of course, during all this half
century, and these Kensington promenades,
out-did the gentlemen in the variety and
novelty of their fashions. Their head-dresses
rose and fell in all the fluctuations of piled-
up and flowing hair; of ringlets, plain and
powdered; of lappets, laces, ribbons, feathers,
commodes, hoods, bonnets, and mob-caps.
Their colours were of the brightest and most
blooming kind. The fan was in constant
requisition; and muffs increased from small
to great. Morning dresses, in doors, might
look a little too careless to modern eyes,

<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>
other reason, best known to the inventor) is
said to have been first copied by the court of
France, in the time of Francis the First.  It
began there with the fardingales, which
gradually swelled  into the "wheel,"  big
" drum," or sort of " go-cart;" but in England
it seems to have burst forth at once into all
its bloom about the year <date value="1708">1708</date>, during the
reign of Anne; and it waxed and waned
afterwards, in proportion as general adoption
rendered the vicissitude necessary to the
exclusives.  The "Tatler" immediately took
notice of it, in papers full of pleasant astonishment; and Pope assigned its " important
charge," and " wide circumference," to twenty
of his guardian spirits in the " Rape of the
Lock ;" who, besides the circumventions of the
designing, were to save it from the aspersions
of tea and coffee-

    <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>

  <quote rend="blockquote"> " Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.</quote>"


 </p><p>  The hoop is considered the most monstrous enormity that ever made its appearance
in the world of fashion. We confess we
cannot think so.   We think the    notion
originates in a mistake ;-in a confusion of
ideas; and that the monstrosity was confined
to its minor phases;-to the    drum, the
go-cart, and the pair of panniers; which last
was the form of it that prevailed towards the
close of the reign of George the Third;
and, under which, it finally went out in
that of his son (for the hoop lasted a good
hundred years in England): and even the
panniers, we think, were by no means at
their worst, when they were at their biggest.
For the philosophy of the matter (to use a
fine modern phrase) we take to be this.



<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>

The hoop, like any other habiliment, was
only ugly inasmuch as it interfered with the
mind's idea of the body's shape.  It was
ugly, when it made the hips appear dislocated,
the body swollen, the gait unnatural; in
other words, as long as it suggested the idea
of some actual deformity, and might have
been considered as made to suit it.
 </p><p> But when it was large, and 'the swell of it
hung at a proper distance from the person, it
became, not an habiliment, but an enclosure.
The person stood aloof from it, and was
imagined to do so. The lady, like a goddess,
was half concealed in a hemisphere; out
of which the rest of her person rose, like
Venus out of the billows.     When   she
moved, and the hoop was of proper length
as well as breadth, she did not walk;-her
steps were not visible ;-she was borne along;
    <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

she was wafted; came gliding. So issued
the Wortley Montagues, the Coventrys, and
the Harveys, out of their sedans; and came
radiant with admirations of beholders, through
avenues of them at palace doors. Thus,
poor Marie Antoinette came, during the
height of her bloom and ascendancy, through
arrays, on either side, of guards and adorers;
and swept along with her the eyes and the
reformations of Mr. Burke.
  </p><p>Therefore, we do not at all wonder at the
enthusiasm of Thomson in his juvenile days,
when he wrote the verses on Beauty:-


  <quote rend="blockquote"> One thing I mind-a spreading hoop she wore,
   Than nothing which adorns a lady more.
   With equal rage could I its beauties sing,
   I'd, with the hoop, make all Parnassus ring.</quote>

     *       *       *        *       *



<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>
   <quote rend="blockquote"> With ladies there my ravished eyes did meet,
    That oft I've seen grace fair Edina's street,
    When their broad hoops cut through the willing
         air,
    Pleas'd to give place unto the lovely fair.</quote>

 </p><p> He thought High Street, Edinburgh,
heaven itself, while the hoops were thus
etherially making their way:-

    <quote rend="blockquote">"Sure this is like those blissful seats above,
    Where all is peace, transporting joy, and love."
</quote>

  </p><p>  And again, in some verses written expressly "On the Hoop." Its appearance, it
seems, in the Scottish capital, was not equally
welcome to all parties.     There were grave
elders, whose imaginations beheld more
danger in it, than was conceivable by the
juvenile poet. He grows angry, calls them
hypocrites, and vindicates the innocence of the

         <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

beloved enormity in a pleasant strain of mingled indignation, humour, and weak versification. There is one capital line, however,
about the Quakers:-

   <quote rend="blockquote"> "The hoop, the darling justly of the fair,
    Of every generous swain deserves the care.
    It is unmanly to desert the weak;
    'Twould urge a stone, if possible, to speak,
    To hear staunch hypocrites bawl out, and cry
    'This hoop's a (wanton) garb; fie, ladies, fie ?'
    O cruel and audacious man, to blast
    The fame of ladies more than vestals chaste!
      Should you go search the globe throughout,<note place="foot" n="1">  A foot has been droped out of this verse.</note>
      None will you find so pious and devout,
      So modest, chaste, so handsome, and so fair,
      As our dear Caledonian ladies are.
      When awful beauty puts on all her charms,
      Nought gives our sex such terrible alarms,
      As when the hoop and tartan both combine
      To make a virgin like a goddess shine.





<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>

     Let quakers cut their clothes unto the quick,
     And with severities themselves afflict,
     But may the hoop adorn Edina's Street,
     Till the South Pole shall with the Northern meet."
</quote>

  </p><p> Thomson's countryman, Allan Ramsay,
was equally zealous in behalf of hoops and
tartans.   He has even       a good word to say
for patches:


     <quote rend="blockquote"> "In your opinion, nothing matches,
        O horrid sin! the crime of patches !
        'Tis false, ye clowns. I'll make 't appear,
        The glorious sun does patches wear;
        Yea, run through every frame of nature,
        You'll find a patch for every creature;
        E'en you yourselves, ye blackened wretches,
        To Heliconians are the patches."</quote>

  <p>MEANTIME, alas! matters may not be
going on so pleasantly in the interior of the
palace.  We take them, in ordinary, to have
been like the matters in most houses; a
mixture of sweet and sour, of insipidity and



<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>

vivacity, of love, and dispute, and gossiping,
and a predominance of good or ill-according as the most amiable or unamiable person
has the ascendancy of the hour.  But in
those days, and in the innermost rooms of
that house, flourished a certain Lord of the
Bed-chamber, called Hervey; who held the
office of secret purveyor of news, gossip,
and flattery, to the Queen and Princesses;
and it pleased this purveyor, who was a
gentleman of so ill a habit of body as to be
forced to live on chicken and milk-and-water,
to keep a record of what he saw daily going
on round about him, in the house-especially
of what was not flattering to anybody, foe or
friend-and to " pot it up," with a secrecy
beyond his office, for the benefit of posterity.
Posterity has been in the habit of thinking,
that a description which Pope wrote of this

<pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

  Lord Hervey was unpardonably severe; and
  we, for one, were of the same opinion.
   </p><p> The record, from  feelings of family deli  cacy, transpired only six years ago.  It is
  entitled, "Memoirs of the Reign of George
  the Second, from his Accession, to the Death
of Queen Caroline;" and though still in a
mutilated state, owing to the like feelings,
posterity has begun to entertain considerable
doubts, whether Pope's description, at least
 as far  as the gossipping  went, was not
perfectly just.
</p><p>Pope calls Hervey an insect, annoying the
  witty and the fair with his buzz; a reptile,
  who

          <quote rend="blockquote"> "At the ear of Eve, familiar toad,
       Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad"</quote>

  in lying, tale-bearing, and spite (Eve is



<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>

Queen    Caroline);    an  effeminate, "amphibious thing,"


             <quote rend="blockquote">"That, acting either part,
    The trifling head, or the corrupted heart,
    Fop at the toilette, flatt'rer at the board,
    Now trips, a lady; and now struts, a lord.
    Eve's tempter thus the Rabbins have express'd,
    A cherub's face, a reptile all the rest;
    Beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust,
    Wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust."
</quote>

  </p><p>  Lord Hervey, assisted by Lady Mary
Wortley   Montague, with       whom    Pope    had
quarrelled, endeavoured to retaliate:     but the
joint noble wits could not satirize like the
son  of the   linen-draper.      Among      other
things which they thought very severe, they
said of his verses, that they were

    <quote rend="blockquote"> " Hard as his heart, and as his birth obscure ;"
</quote>

  <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

 which, besides the glaring falsehood, was an
 anti-climax of the most absurd description,
 and only served to show the meanness into
 which aristocratical pride could fall.  Pope,
 however, on his part, was not magnanimous
 enough to let the blow pass without retaliation.
  </p><p> The secret of excessive personal severity,
where parties have been acquainted, is
generally to be found in mortified self-love.
    Lady Mary had wounded that of the infirm
    little poet, in its tenderest point: Hervey,
we doubt not, had talked of Pope to Queen
Caroline; and with this caution, both against
the court-gossip and his assailant, we proceed
to extract some notable passages from  the
"Memoirs," respecting the life led in Kensington Palace by the royal persons who
admitted Hervey into their confidence, and to
whom, besides daily bowing to and flattering




<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>

them, he of course took care never to intimate, in the remotest degree, what things
he meant to leave on record about them,
when they were dead and gone.
 </p><p>The reader will see that the passages
increase in interest at every step.
 </p><p> "Sir Robert    Walpole  (according  to
Hervey) told him, that the King one day, at
Kensington, shut himself up in a closet,
leaving the door ajar, in order that he might
overhear a conversation between Sir Robert
and the Queen."
  </p><p>"In the absence of the King (at Hanover)
the Queen had taken several very bad pictures
out of the great drawing-room at Kensington,
and put very good ones in their places: the
King, affecting, for the sake of contradiction,
to dislike this change, or, from his extreme
ignorance in painting, really disapproving it,

 <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

told Lord Hervey, as Vice Chamberlain, that
he would have every new picture taken away,
and every old one replaced. Lord Hervey,
who had a mind to make his court to the
Queen by opposing this order, asked if his
Majesty would not give leave for the two
Vandykes, at least, on each side of the chimney
to remain, instead of those two sign-posts,
done by nobody knew who, that had been
removed to make way for them.  To which
the King answered, ' My Lord, I have a
great respect for your taste in what you
understand, but in pictures I beg leave to
follow my own; I suppose you assisted the
Queen with your fine advice when she was
pulling my house to pieces, and spoiling all
my furniture; thank God, at least she has
left the walls standing! As for the Vandykes,
I do not care whether they are changed or



<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>
not; but for the picture with the dirty frame
over the door, and the three nasty little
children, I will have them taken away, and
the old ones restored; I will have it done
to-morrow morning, before I go to London,
or else I know it will not be done at all.'
 </p><p>  "' Would   your   Majesty,' said  Lord
Hervey, 'have the gigantic fat Venus restored too?'
 </p><p> " Yes, my Lord; I am not so nice as your
Lordship. I like my fat Venus, much better
than anything you have given me instead of
her.' "<note place="foot" n="1">This inuendo would seem to charge Lord Hervey with
being one of the procurers of Mistresses for his Majesty.
</note>
 </p><p> Lord Hervey thought, though he did not
dare to say, that, if his Majesty had liked his
fat Venus as well as he used to do, there
would have been none of these disputations.

    <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>

 However, finding his jokes on this occasion
 were as little tasted, as his reasonings approved,
 and that the King, as usual, grew more warm
 and peremptory on everything that was said
 to cool and alter him, his Lordship was
 forced to make a serious bow; and though
 he knew the fat Venus was at Windsor,
 some of the other pictures at Hampton
Court, and all the frames of the removed
       pictures cut or enlarged to fit their successors, he assured his Majesty that everything should be done without fail, next
 morning, just as he had ordered.
 </p><p>"Lord Hervey told the Queen, next morning
 at breakfast, what had passed the night before;
 who affected to laugh, but was a good deal
 displeased, and more ashamed.   She said,
 'The King, to be sure, was master of his own
 furniture;' and asked Lord Hervey if the


<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>

pictures were changed; who told her, no,
and why it was impossible they should.
She charged him not to tell the King why,
but to find out some other reason. Whilst
they were speaking, the King came in, but,
by good luck, said not one word of the
pictures; his Majesty stayed about five
minutes in the gallery; snubbed the Queen,
who was drinking chocolate, for being always
stuffing; the Princess Emily for not hearing
him; the Princess Caroline for being grown
fat; the Duke of Cumberland for standing
awkwardly; Lord Hervey for not knowing
what relation the Prince of Sultzbach was to
the Elector Palatine; and then carried the
Queen to walk, and be re-snubbed, in the
garden.     *     *     *
 </p><p> " When the Queen declared she intended to
stay at Kensington till the King came back
    <pb id="p.179" n="179"/>

(from another of his visits to Hanover), the
Prince (of Wales, Frederick, father of George
the Third), who had a mind to go to London
for the same reason that the Queen avoided
it, which was, because he thought his Majesty
would dislike it, told the Queen, his expenses
at Kensington were so great, and his lodgings
there were so damp, that he intended to
remove to London; and would fain have
drawn her in, either to consent to this design,
or to lay her commands upon him not to put
it into execution; but he could bring neither
of these things about-she declined both"
..... The Prince, therefore, "made Kensington his sejour principal (as he called it),
for the rest of the time the Court stayed at
Kensington; that is, he left the Princess's
Maids of Honour, and some of the male
servants constantly there; but the Princess


<pb id="p.180" n="180"/>

and he seldom lay there above one or two
nights in the week."
 </p><p> What sort of visitor this young man
was considered by the family, may be supposed, from the dismal fact, that he was
hated by every one of them, father and
another not excepted.  His sisters openly
avowed their contempt for him: the king
pronounced him  a "puppy," "fool," and
"scoundrel:" and the Queen " cursed the
hour in which he was born." Even the
good-natured minister described him as a
" poor, weak, irresolute, false, lying, dishonest,
contemptible wretch." Unfeeling levity appears to have been the main point of his
character.  It is the expression of his face
in his portraits.  One of his modes of
annoying his mother at Kensington, was by
coming too late to chapel, and making his

   <pb id="p.181" n="181"/>

wife, instead of entering by another door,
squeeze to her seat, between the Queen and
her Majesty's prayer-book. He afterwards,
for similar spiteful reasons, hazarded his
wife's existence by bringing her from Hampton Court to St. James's, almost in the very
instant of child-birth.
 </p><p> Looking out, one day, from a window in
Kensington Palace, and seeing title-hunting
Bubb Doddington go by, he said, "That
man is reckoned one of the most sensible
men in England; and yet, with all his
cleverness, I have just nicked him out of
&#x00A3;5000."
 </p><p> Traits like these made his parents call to
mind what an honest governor said of him
when he was a boy. The governor complained of some tricks which he had been
playing; the mother, not seeing what such



<pb id="p.182" n="182"/>
conduct foreshadowed, said, good-naturedly,
"Ah, those are pages' tricks, I conceive."
"Pages' tricks !" cried the governor; "I
wish to God, madam, they were. They are
tricks of lacqueys and rascals."
  </p><p>The nicker of Bubb Doddington nicked
himself, at the age of forty-nine, out of life
and a throne, by putting on a thin dress
during cold weather, because he felt himself
hot with a pleurisy!
 </p><p> If Pope, who had been introduced to this
Prince, and who took his part against his
mother, had but seen these and other notices
of him, the truth of which is now admitted by
every body, he never would have said a word
against the poor Queen, even though himself
had been more injured in her estimation by
Hervey's venom, than we have no doubt he
was.</p>

<p>'LORD HERVEY, for the amusement of thE
Queen, and for the recommendation of himself
at the expense of others, wrote a little Kensington drama, called "The Death of Lord
Hervey, or a Morning at Court." We extract



<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>
from it two or three lively passages, relating
to a breakfast, a divine service, and a levee;
because in the one, the reader will find himself in company with Queen Caroline, under
circumstances characteristic of her manners
towards those about her; in the second, a
very candid exhibition is made of her indifference for court-chaplains; and in the third,
he will see what the royal talk on court-days
must, to a certain extent, of necessity, be.
Hervey takes insidious advantage of the favour
he was in with her Majesty; whose willingness
to think the best of her gossiping lord of the
Bedchamber would not have been so amused
with the thing as she was, could she have
seen the Memoir in which she has been
preserved for posterity.  The simultaneous
emphasis with which she divides her emotions  between  the  news  of a friend's
      <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>

death and the delights of a cup of chocolate, and the sarcasms which plentifully
acidulate the sweets of her obliging enquiries
round the court circle, would have come
out with stronger and more suspicious
effect.
 </p><p> The tragical exclamation of Princess
Caroline, when she first hears of the supposed death, and the striking circumstance of
her twisting off the thumbs of her glove, are
meant to imply the love which this poor girl,
the most amiable of the family, is said to
have entertained for the unworthy biographer.
How he could have alluded to it at all, as a
gentleman, especially through such a medium
as a court effusion like this, written for the
purpose of entertaining her mother, and which
every  body  would  read  "confidentially"
whom his vanity could get to do so, must




<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>
be inconceivable at the British court of the
<date value="1855">1855</date>.
 </p><p> We have added translations of the French
passages between brackets, not " for the benefit
of the country gentlemen," as the phrase used
to  run  (for country gentlemen,   except,
perhaps, in sporting instances, are now, we
believe, pretty much on a par with others in
such matters) but for the benefit of that
large addition to the class of readers, qualified
to enjoy what they read, which has been made
of late years without a commensurate increase
of education.</p>

</p><p>
    I cannot imagine why one should not be
 sorry for him. I think it very dure [unfeeling] not to be sorry for him.  I own he
 used to laugh mal-apropos sometimes, but he
 was mightily mended; and for people that
 were civil to him, he was always ready to do
 anything to oblige them; and, for my part,
 I am sorry I assure.  [Is this a foreign slip,
 for "am  sure?"]
 </p><p>
          PRINCESS EMILY.

   Mama, Caroline is duchtich ; <note place="foot" n="5"> Disingenuous ? double-meaning ? I have applied to

I swear, now, he was very good, poor my
Lord Hervey; and with people's lives that
is no jest. My dear Purcel, this is the
nastiest fruit I have ever tasted; is there
none of the Duke of Newcastle's ? or that
old fool Johnstone's ?  Il etoit bienjoli quelquefois [He was very pleasant, sometimes]
my Lord Hervey; was he not, Lifford ?

</p><p>
  Ah! psha; n'y a-t-il point de difference

jamais je crois a-t-il dit le moindre impertinence sur votre sujet. [Nonsense. Is there

      <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>

no difference between weeping for people, and
laughing at their misfortunes ? Besides, you
did him great wrong while he was with us;
for he always conducted himself personally
towards you with a great deal of respect, and I
don't believe he ever uttered a syllable about
you in a different spirit.]

  Pour moi, je ne le crois pas: je ne dis pas

que la Emilie n'a pas raison de le croire; parce
qu'il y a mille gens qui pensent faire leur cour,
en disant qu'ils l'ont entendu parler impertinement; mais je n'ais jamais entendu de ces
choses dans son stile, et je connais son stile;
et, outre cela, il m'a paru s'etre fait une regle
de ne le point faire. [I don't believe he did
anything of the sort.  I don't say that Emily
may have no reasons for thinking otherwise;
for there are heaps of people who tell stories
of that kind by way of making court. But I
never met with any such stories that bore
the mark of his style; and I know his style.
Besides, he always appeared to me to act
upon a positive system of the reverse.]

dear children: it's getting late. Just hasten
Mailbone as you go.]  Exeunt.

</p><p>
  The duplicity within duplicity of this
passage respecting Princess Emily is remarkable. Its object is to pay respectful court
to the Princess, and at the same time, to
put her in the wrong and himself in the
right with third parties, without leaving her
any fault to find  with the  tone of his
vindication.
 </p><p> Now compare what he here says of her,
with the following passage in his Memoirs,
which was written in the same year as the
drama.
</p><p>

  "The   Queen   used to speak to Lord

<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>
Hervey on this subject with as little reserve
when the Princess Caroline was present
as when alone;    but never    before the
Princess Emily, who had managed her affairs
so well, as to have lost entirely the confidence of her mother, without having obtained the friendship of her brother.  By
trying to make her court by turns to both,
she had by turns betrayed both, and at
last lost both.
  </p><p>" Princess Emily had much the least sense,
except her brother, of the family, but had
for two years much the prettiest person.
She was lively, false, and a great liar;
did many ill offices to people, and no good
ones; and, for want of prudence, said as
many shocking things to their faces, as for
want of good-nature or truth she said disagreeable  ones behind their backs.  She

    <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

had as many enemies as acquaintances, for
nobody knew her without disliking her.
 </p><p> "Lord Hervey was very ill with her:
she had first used him ill, to flatter her
brother, which of course had made him
not use her very well; and the preference
on every occasion he gave her sister, the
Princess Caroline, completed their mutual
dislike."
</p><p>
  Take also the following incident, though it
occurred at St. James's, and not at Kensington.
</p><p>
  "One night whilst the Queen was ill, as he
(the King) was sitting in his night-gown and
night-cap in a great chair, with his legs upon
a stool, and nobody in the room with him
but the Princess Emily, who lay upon a

</p><p>
<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>

couch, and Lord Hervey, who sat by the
fire, he talked in this strain of his own
courage in the storm and his illness, till
the Princess Emily, as Lord Hervey thought,
fell fast asleep, whilst Lord Hervey, as tired
as he was of the present conversation and
this last week's watching, was left alone to
act civil auditor and adroit courtier, to
applaud what he heard, and every now and
then to ask such proper questions as led the
King into giving some more particular
detail of his own magnanimity.  The King,
turning towards Princess Emily, and seeing
her eyes shut, cried,
  </p><p>"'Poor good child ! her duty, affection,
and attendance on her mother have quite
exhausted her spirits.'
 </p><p> "And soon after he went into the Queen's
room.

     <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

  </p><p>"'As soon as his back was turned, Princess Emily started up, and said,
  </p><p> '" Is he gone ? How tiresome he is !'
  </p><p> "Lord Hervey, who had no mind to
trust her Royal Highness with his singing
her father's praises in duetto with her, replied only,
  </p><p>"'I thought your Royal Highness had
been asleep.'
 </p><p> "'No,   said the   Princess Emily; 'L
only shut my eyes that I might not join in
the ennuyant conversation, and wish I could
have shut my ears too.  In the first place,
I am sick to death of hearing of his great
courage every day of my life; in the next
place, one thinks now of Mama, and not
of him.   Who cares for his old storm ?
I believe, too, it is a great lie, and that
he was as much afraid as I should have been,

<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>
for all what he says now; and as to his
not being afraid when he was ill, I know
that is a lie, for I saw him, and I heard
all his sighs and his groans, when he was
in no more danger than I am at this moment.   He was talking, too, for ever of
dying, and that he was sure he should not
recover.
 </p><p>" All this, considering the kind things
which she had heard the King say the minute
before, when he imagined her asleep, Lord
Hervey  thought   a  pretty  extraordinary
return for her to make for that paternal
goodness, or would have thought it so in
anybody but her; and looked upon this
openness to him, whom she did not love, yet
less to be accounted for, unless he could
have imagined it was to draw him in to
echo her, and then to relate what he

 <p>  Scene.-The   QUEEN'S  dressing-room.
The QUEEN is discovered at her toilet,
cleaning her teeth; MRS. PURCEL dressing her Majesty's head, the PRINCESSES,
LADY PEMBROKE, and LADY BURLINGTON,
LADIES OF THE BEDCHAMBER, and LADY

standing round.  Morning prayers saying
in the next room.

  "From  pride, vain glory, and hypocrisy,
from envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharitableness-"

</p><p>
  I pray, my good Lady Sundon, shut a
little that door; those creatures pray so loud,
one cannot hear oneself speak [LADY SUNDON goes to shut the door.]  So, so; not
quite so much; leave it enough open for

those parsons to think we may hear, and
enough shut that we may not hear quite so

  The Queen's indifference to religious offices
of this kind, and to clergymen in general as
men of a profession, did not extend to those
among them whom she thought sincere, and
whose abilities she admired. On the contrary, she took a conspicuous interest in
the conversation of such men as Sherlock
and Hoadly, though she is accused of
having had a malicious satisfaction in
setting them disputing, and witnessing their
conclusions. One of her reverend courtiers,
whom her Mistress of the Robes, the
above-mentioned Lady Sundon, persuaded
her to make a bishop, absolutely put his
conscience into the hands of that serving-

himself, on its dictates, according as they found

 What do you say, Lady Burlington, to

  How sorry is that, my good Lady Burlington ?

  Not so sorry as not to admit of consolation.

</p><p>
                QUEEN.
</p><p>
  I am sure you have not forgiven him his
jokes upon Chiswick. I used to scold him
for that too, for Chiswick is the prettiest
thing I ever saw in my life. But I must



<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>

say, poor my Lord Hervey, he was very
pretty too.
</p><p>

LADY BURLINGTON [colouring and taking

</p><p>
  I can't think your Majesty does Chiswick any great honour by the comparison.

  [Lady Burlington, a daughter of Savile,
the celebrated Marquis of Halifax, was wife
to Pope's Earl of Burlington, the builder of

</p><p>
  He was very well for once, like a party
to Vauxhall, where the glare and the bustle
entertain one for a little while; but one was

       <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>

 always tired of one as well as t'other in half-
 an-hour.
</p><p>
                 QUEEN.
</p><p>
Oh! oh! I beg your pardon.  I wish all
the Vauxhalls were like him, I assure you-
I would divert myself exceedingly with Vauxhall; and for your half-hour, I am your
humble servant.  He has entertained me,
  poor my Lord Hervey, many and many
half-hours, I can promise you; but I am
sure you thought we laughed at you a little
sometimes, as well as Chiswick.   Come,
  own the truth.
</p><p>
            LADY BURLINGTON.
</p><p>
    I never thought enough about him to
  think whether he did or not; but I suppose
  we had all our share.

  I must say, I never in my life heard my
Lord Hervey make or give into a joke
upon people that he professed living at all
well with.
</p><p>
[Let the reader bear in mind, that he was
all the while writing these " Memoirs," in
which he cuts up the said people all round
him. Lady Sundon continues.]
</p><p>
  He would say a lively thing sometimes, to
be sure, upon people he was indifferent to,
and very bitter ones upon people he was not
indifferent to; and I believe we are all glad
enough to do that, when we have a fair opportunity.

  Did you really love him? [Laughs, and
mutters  something  in   German   to the
QUEEN.]

</p><p>
             LADY SUNDON.
</p><p>
  I had a great deal of reason, for he was
always very particularly civil and kind to
me.
</p><p>

           LADY BURLINGTON.

</p><p>
  If he was very civil to you, it was being
very particular to you, that's certain.

</p><p>
  I beg your pardon; he was very well
bred.
</p><p>

           LADY BURLINGTON.
</p><p>
  Where it was his interest, perhaps: he
was very well bred to your Majesty, I dare
say.
</p><p>
             LADY SUNDON.

</p><p>
  I am sure he loved the Queen.
</p><p>

            PRINCESS EMILY.

</p><p>
  That is, you are sure he said so, my good
Lady Sundon; and so will all mamma's

    <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>
</p><p>
            LADY SUNDON.
</p><p>
  But he said it in a way that I think I
could see whether he felt what he said, or
not. He has often said, that the Queen had
a thousand good, and agreeable, and amiable
qualities, that one should like in a private
person; and that he could not conceive why
those qualities were not to be loved because
they were in a Queen-and one felt the
justness of that way of thinking; and I
assure your Royal Highness, I think the
Queen will have a very great loss of him;
for, besides the use he was of in Parliament,
which I do not pretend to be a judge of, he
was certainly a constant amusement to the
Queen in private, and gave up his whole
time to amuse her;<note place="foot" n="6">Being husband, all the while, of the charming Mary

  Ha! ha! ha! You are always so good

you have very good fruit there, and are
very curious in it; you have very good

some passages, as being   too indecent for

 </p><p> So much for the equivocal part that
Queen Caroline is made to perform, even in
a piece intended to please her. What would
she have thought of the uncommunicated
scenes  at Court, in   the   rest of the
"Memoirs," where, in spite of the good
things still said of her, and of the biographer's  professed  devotedness  to  her
memory, her vanities are exposed, her secretest confidences betrayed, the spirit of
her self-sacrifices to her husband converted
into artifice and ambition, and the personal
infirmities, which she preferred death to
mentioning, disclosed, ridiculed, and made
offensive ? There were also things to be told
of her, according to this friend, which
" could not be heightened," and which were

  <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>

"scarcely to be credited."   So, he tells
them!
 </p><p> We allude to those more than tolerations
of her husband's infidelity, which Sir Robert
Walpole countenanced, which are said to
have been lauded to her Majesty's face by an
Archbishop (Blackburne), and for which she
had found warrant, perhaps, not only in
other courts, but in a remarkable chapter of
the "Essays" of Montaigne.   The particulars we must not here repeat; but nobody
will doubt that their disclosure was to the last
degree base in a man, who must have
tolerated the toleration with, at least, the
most courtly silence; probably, with implied admiration; and who waited for the
death of his benefactress to betray it to the
world.
 </p><p> To complete these portentous instances of



<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>

ingratitude, we subjoin the passages respecting the Queen's alleged love of domination,
preceded by an account of the Lord Lifford
above mentioned, and his lordship's wife,
equally disparaging to the writer's " gracious
master,"  and  "most beloved   mistress."
The whole is a manifest caricature; and, we
doubt not, full of falsehoods.
</p><p>

Enter MILORD and LADY LIFFORD, to
  have their portraits painted by their friend
  and fellow-servant, LORD HERVEY.
</p><p>
  " These two people, born in France, having
more religion (says his Lordship,) than sense,
(let the reader note that, and think of him
in attendance at the chapel royal), left their
native country on a crime of being Protestants; and being of great quality, and not in
   <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>

great circumstances, had, during four reigns
subsisted on the scanty charity of the English
court. They were constantly-every night in
the country, and three nights of the week in
town--alone with the King and Queen for
an hour or two before they went to bed,
during which time the King walked about
and talked to the brother of armies, or to the
sister of genealogies, whilst the Queen knitted
and yawned, till from yawning she came to
nodding, and from nodding to snoring.
  </p><p> "These two miserable court-drudges were
in more constant waiting than any of the
pages of the back-stairs, were very simple,
and very quiet, did nobody any hurt, nor
anybody but his Majesty any pleasure, who
paid them  so ill for all their assiduity and
slavery, that they were not only not in
affluence, but laboured under the disagreeable


<pb id="p.232" n="232"/>

burdens of small debts (which a thousand
pounds would have paid), and had not an
allowance from the Court that enabled them
to appear there even in the common decency
of clean clothes. The King, nevertheless,
was always saying how well he loved them,
and calling them the best people in the world.
But, though he never forgot their goodness,
he never remembered their poverty; and, by
giving them so much of his time, which
nobody but him would have given them, and
so little of his money, which everybody but
him in his situation would have afforded
them, he gave one just as good an opinion of
his understanding by what he bestowed, as
he did of his generosity by what he withheld.
The Queen, whose most glaring merit was
not that of giving, was certainly, with regard
to this poor woman, as blameable as the

     <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>

King.  For the playthings of princes, let
them be ever so trifling, ought always to be
gilt, those who contribute to their pleasures
having a right to their bounty.
</p><p>" To most people, however, it was a matter
of wonder how the King and Queen could
have such  persons constantly with them.
The truth of the case was, that the King had
no taste for better company, and the Queen,
though she had a better taste, was forced to
mortify her own to please his.  Her predominant passion was pride, and the darling
pleasure of her soul was power; but she was
forced to gratify the one and gain the other,
as some people do health, by a strict and
painful regime, which few   besides herself
could have had the courage to support, or
resolution to adhere to.  She was at least
seven or eight hours tete-a-tete with the King


<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>

every day, during which time she was generally saying what she did not think, assenting
to what she did not believe, and praising
what she did not approve; for they were-
seldom of the same opinion, and he too fond
of his own for her ever at first to dare to
controvert it, (" consilii quamvis egregii quod
ipse non afferret, inimicus.") "An enemy to
any counsel, however excellent, which he
himself had   not   suggested."- Tacitus.
She used to give him her opinion as jugglers
do a card, by changing it imperceptibly, and
making him believe he held the same with
that he first pitched upon. But that which
made these tete-a-tetes seem  heaviest, was
that as he neither liked reading or being read
to (unless it was to sleep), she was forced,
like the spider, to spin out of her bowels all
the conversation with which the fly was taken.

      <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

However, to all this she submitted for the
sake of power, and for the reputation of
having it; for the vanity of being thought
to possess what she desired, was equal to the
pleasure of the possession itself.  But, either
for the appearance or the reality, she knew it
was absolutely necessary to have interest in
her husband, as she was sensible that interest
was the measure by which people would
always judge of her power.      Her every
thought, word, and act, therefore, tended and
was calculated to preserve her influence there.
To him she sacrificed her time; for him she
mortified her inclination; she looked, spake,
and breathed but for him, like a weathercock to every capricious blast of his uncertain temper, and governed him (if such influence so gained can bear the name of
government) by being as great a slave to him



<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>

thus ruled as any other wife could be to a
man who ruled her.     For all the tedious
hours she spent, then, in watching him whilst
he slept, or the heavier task of entertaining
him whilst he was awake, her single consolation was in reflecting she had power, and
that people in coffee-houses and ruelles were
saying she governed the country, without
knowing how dear the government of it
cost her."<note place="foot" n="8">Vol. I. p. 292</note>
 </p><p> Such are the opinions    respecting  his
benefactress which Lord Hervey wishes
us to think he secretly held, all the while
he was looking her in the face, and expressing his love, and gratitude, and adoration !!!
 </p><p> Lord Hervey, amidst all his talk about
others, forgot one thing about himself
      <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

which, in spite of himself, he nevertheless
disclosed also; namely, that as a servile and
fawning courtier, he was a liar by habit;
and, as all gossips tend to be liars by inclination, in consequence of the pepper and
be-devilment which calumny gives to discourse, Hervey was probably a liar of the
grossest, because most malignant, description.
Readers, therefore, are warranted in believing
just as much of him, or as little as they
please. He has exonerated Pope from the
charge  of  calumniating  him;    and  in
Pope's satire  he   accordingly  remains,
pinned  down    for  ever,  as  the  most
monstrous and venomous thing in the
shape of a butterfly, which ever infested a
court.
 </p><p> To all the poison of Hervey's libels on his
benefactress, we would oppose, as their crowning



<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>
 antidote, the following simple notice of
her, written after her death, by the Countess
of Hertford, subsequently Duchess of Somerset; Thomson's Countess, the friend of
him and Shenstone; formerly one of the
ladies of Caroline's bedchamber.  It is to be
found in her Correspondence with another
intelligent  and  amiable   woman,    the
Countess of Pomfret, and implies the latter's
joint  testimony  to  the  truth  of the
record.
 </p><p> "I have had the pleasure," says Lady
Hertford, "of seeing at Rysbach's a bust of
our ever-regretted mistress, so like her (except a little too much height in the nose),
that I could not look upon it without feeling
a return of that tender concern which we
each experienced this time twelvemonths,
with as much truth as any that were in her

     <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

all Sunday and Monday, that I was downright ill; and had, in imagination, much
conversation with you on the subject. During
both those days, I was almost persuaded that
you and I were again placed on each side the
fire, in the little waiting-room at St. James's,
where we sat that fatal Sunday night which
robbed the world of one whose loss there is
every day greater cause to lament, and on
whom I can never think without a sigh."
</p><p>  This is evidently a testimony from the
heart. Its warmth, unabated by the lapse of
a twelvemonth; the pressure of the recollection on the writer's mind for two days
together, till she became "downright ill;"
her taking Lady Pomfret's equal sympathy


<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>

for granted; and even that little piece of
homely painting-the sitting  on the two
sides of the fire-place,-all show the truth
and depth of the sorrow professed, and are
worth a million of the representations of a
malignant courtier, who confesses that he lied
whenever it suited him, and who had probably found, in some corner of the confidential letters of poor Caroline, in possession
of " a friend," a mention of himself, such as
her habitual good-nature, and her wish to
think the best of those about her, had too
often spared him. One little caustic drop on
the vanity of such a man, however unwillingly dropped, would have sufficed to bring
forth all his venom.
 </p><p> We shall conclude these references to Lord
Hervey's Memoirs, with a passage, not insignificant in itself, but which becomes doubly
      <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>

curious from the secret feelings which this
court historian must have entertained, both
while he was writing it, and while he was
talking it.
 </p><p> He was one day in conversation with the
King and Queen, when he told them that
"he knew three people that were writing the
history of his Majesty's reign, who could
possibly know nothing of the palace and
his Majesty's closet; and yet would, he
doubted not, pretend to make their whole
history one continued dissection of both.
 </p><p> "You mean," said the King, " Lords
Bolingbroke, Chesterfield, and Carteret."
 </p><p> " I do," replied Lord Hervey.
 </p><p> "They will all three," said the King,
"have as much truth in them as the Mille et
Une Nuits-(the Arabian Nights.)     Not
but I shall like to read Bolingbroke's, who,

<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>
of all those rascals and knaves that have
been lying against me these ten years, has
certainly the best parts and the most
knowledge. He is a scoundrel; but he is a
scoundrel of a higher class than Chesterfield.
Chesterfield is a little tea-table scoundrel,
that tells little  womanish   lies  to  make
quarrels in families; and tries to make women
lose  their  reputations,  and   make   their
husbands beat them,<note place="foot" n="10">Strange intimation of manners at that time! Footmen
were beaten, according to what we read in comedies;
but we never before met with an intimation of the beating
of gentlewomen.</note> without any object but
to give himself airs; as if anybody could
believe a woman could like a dwarf-baboon."
 </p><p> The Queen said all these three histories
would be three heaps of lies, but lies of very
different kinds.  She said   "Bolingbroke's
    <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

would be great lies; Chesterfield's little lies;
and Cartaret's lies of both sorts."
 </p><p> Doubtless both King and Queen suspected
that their chattering and scribbling Vice-
Chamberlain would himself write the Secret
History; and they flattered themselves, that
as he flattered them so strongly to their
faces, he would be equally respectful to their
memories.
 </p><p> We have seen the result.   None of the
other three histories ever made their appearance; and Hervey, perhaps, only mentioned
them  in order to take a treacherous pleasure
in contemplating the faces and the feelings
of his victims.
 </p><p> With Caroline's power to hold court-days
at Kensington, her connexion with the place
ceases; for she did not die there.  George
the Second, ever regretting the loss of her,

<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>

did; though it was not of sorrow for the
loss, for he survived her upwards of twenty
years. He died even of a broken heart;
though, like many a man who has so done,
he does not appear to have been suffering under any particular affliction. Many
men die of broken hearts, who have no
afflictions;  and  many  die  of affliction,
whose hearts have remained physically untouched.
 </p><p> On the morning of the 25th October,
<date value="1760">1760</date>, a fall was heard in the royal apartments, soon after breakfast.  It was the
King.   He had    cut his face against a
bureau, in the act of falling, and was dead
of disease of the heart, at the age of
seventy-eight.
 </p><p> On examination of the body, the right
ventricle of the heart was found burst.  He


      <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>

was, otherwise, in good health; and, owing
to a combination of lucky circumstances, he
was one of the most prosperous monarchs
that ever sat on the British throne.  But
prosperity, perhaps, had aggravated the self-
will in which it is the misfortune of most
princes to be too much indulged; contradictoin becomes unbearable to them; the heart
is rendered diseased by agitation at every little
annoyance; and a small trouble may give
it the mortal blow.    The   peril is not
confined to  kings, or even  to  common
understandings.  John  Hunter, the   celebrated surgeon, died of a paroxysm  of this
disease, merely because he was opposed by
some professional brethren in his recommendation of a man whom he patronized.
George the Second, after all, had had his
way, for the most part, so pleasantly to


<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>
himself, that he lived to be near eighty.
Men of more patient callings, therefore,
may look to live still longer, diseases of
heart notwithstanding, especially if they
have the wisdom to abide by the recommendation of a great man (painter and poet
combined) who lived to be older than George,
and who advises us, when we cannot do what
we will, to will what we can do.

<p>
  WITH the decease of George the Second,



<pb id="p.248" n="248"/>

glory departed from  Kensington, as far as
Courts were concerned.  No reigning sovereign has resided there since. George the
Third, who inheriting, perhaps, a dislike of the
place from his father, the Prince of Wales,
appears to have taken no notice of it, except in appointing the clever, but impudent, quack, Sir John Hill, its gardener,
at the recommendation of Sir John's then
omnipotent brother botanist, the Earl of
Bute.
</p><p>  George the Fourth probably regarded the
place as a homely concern, quite out of his
line. It might suit well enough the book-
collecting inclinations of his brother, the
Duke of Sussex, with which he had no
sympathy; was not amiss as a means of
affording a lodging to his brother, the
Duke of Kent, with whose habits of regularity,

<pb id="p.249" n="249"/>

 and pardonable amount of debt, his
sympathies were as little; and, lastly, he was
well content to think, that the staid-looking
house and formal gardens rendered the spot
a good out-of-the-way sort of place enough,
for obscuring the growth and breeding of his
niece, and probable  heiress, the Princess
Victoria, whose life, under the guidance of
a wise mother, promised to furnish so
estimable a contrast to his own.   As to
his brother, King William the Fourth,
though he too was a brother, in most
respects, very different from  himself, we
never heard his name mentioned    in any
way  whatever in  connection  with Kensington.
</p><p>  Adieu then, for the present, and for we
know not how long a time hereafter, to
Court-holdings in the  Palace;  to Court

<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>

splendours, and Court scandals.   Adieu,
Kings listening in closets, and Queens calumniated by ungrateful biographers. Adieu,
even Maids of Honour.     They departed
their Kensington life with George the
Second, and went to live a terribly dull one,
with his grandson's Queen, Charlotte, who
nearly tired Miss Burney into a consumption.
 </p><p> As we cannot help giving a loving and
pitying look at the departing Maids, we
here transcribe, for the benefit of the sympathizing reader, the latest account we can
find of them, in King George the Third's
History.  It is the latest account of the
sisterhood, in any  history; and must be
taken with allowance for the exaggerations
natural to the scape-grace to whom it is
attributed;  namely, the  " wicked  Lord

   <pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

Lyttleton," as he was called, to distinguish
him from his father and others, the good
Lords.  The  authorship is questionable;
but the details seem founded on good authority; and any amount of dullness might be
looked for, among the Maids of Honour of
Queen Charlotte.  The reader will observe,
in the course of the account, that the poor
Maids, ghosts   of  their former selves,
occasionally  paid  visits  to  the  spot
which had been animated by their predecessors.
  </p><p>" To make up at least two Court suits in
a year (says the writer) ; to dance as many
Court minuets in the same space; to sidle,
on days of duty, through the presence-
chamber, at the tail of a royal procession;
to take her place in  an established corner
of the drawing-room; to say 'Yes, Sir,' or

<pb id="p.252" n="252"/>

'No, Sir,' and courtesy, when she is noticed
by the King; to say, 'Yes, Madam,' and
'No, Madam,' and     courtesy, when  the
Queen does her the same honour; to make
an occasional one of six large hoops, in a
royal coach, and to aid the languor of an
easy party, in a side-box at a royal play;
compose the principal labours of a Maid of
Honour's life.
 </p><p> "But they are not without their rewards. A moderate salary, and a thousand
pounds, when Miss gets an husband; an
apartment in a palace, and, I believe, a
dinner from a royal kitchen; in a rotation
of six weeks, a seven days' possession of a
royal coach, a royal coachman, and a shabby
pair of royal horses, for the purpose of
shopping in the city, and paying distant
visits; airings in the King's Road, and the

      <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>

being set down at the very gate of Kensington  Gardens, while   women of the first
fashion are obliged to trip it o'er an hundred
yards of green-sward, between their coaches
and the place of admittance; to take place
of Baronets'  daughters; to  go to plays,
operas, and oratorios, gratis; to have physicians without fees, and medicines without
the apothecary's bill; to chat with Lords
and Grooms of the Bed-chamber, around
the fire of an ante-chamber; to stroke the
beardless face of a new-made page; and,
perhaps, to receive an Heir-Apparent's first
effort at flirtation;  constitute the various
privileges of a Maid of Honour.
  </p><p>"This brief history, my dear friend, you
well know to be founded on fact, and will,
therefore, be ready to applaud the tender
pity I feel for these virgin automatons.  I


<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>

have never seen them bringing up the rear
of a royal train, but each of them has appeared to bear, in legible characters, on her
forehead, 'Who will marry me?'    Nevertheless, upon the most favourable average,
not one in three years, during the present
reign, has been rewarded by Hymen; which,
in their particular situation, it is as pitiable
a circumstance as can be found in the
long catalogue of female mortifications.
</p><p> "A Lady of the Bed-chamber is obliged
only to do partial duty; and, during the
short period of her attendance, is, in some
degree, the companion of her royal mistress;
while the Virgins of Honour are not admitted, as I have been informed, to stick a
pin in a royal handkerchief.   Even  the
Women of the same department figure only
in her Majesty's cast off gowns, on royal

   <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>

birth-days;  but these  poor   persecuted
damsels are the common hackneys of
drawing-room parade: whether ill or well,
in humour, or out of humour, by day-light,
or by candle-light, they are obliged, through
three parts of the year, to be on the continual stretch of state official exhibition.
 </p><p> "I remember, when I was little more
than a boy, to have seen a young lady in
training for this important office; and the
whole of that serious business consisted in
nothing more than a practical lecture upon
entrances and exits, the language of courtesies,
and the art of conducting a large hoop in all
modes and forms of possible pliancy. * * *
 </p><p> "After this manner did    I treat the
Honourable Subject of her Majesty's Honourable Virgins; and little did I think it would
beget a long admonitory epistle from you,


<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>

to warn me against speaking evil of dignities.
My wit, such as it is, has never directed a
single glance at the  Throne."
</p><p>  So much for the disparagements of the
poor maids by the wit that would not speak
evil of dignities! The lovely Dillons and
Stanleys of the present day will know how to
estimate such ungallant distinctions at their
just value, and smile to think how little they
need the pity bestowed on the unmarrying
attendants of grudging Queen Charlotte.
 </p><p> But if no reigning sovereign has lived in
Kensington Palace, since the time of George
the Second, a sovereign grace, of a new
description, has occurred to it; for Queen
Victoria was born, as well as bred, within its
walls.  We regret, as a special personal disappointment, (if many loyal and loving
reasons may warrant us in so speaking,)

    <pb id="p.257" n="257"/>

that, while these pages have been proceeding
from our pen, constant illness has prevented
us from  availing ourselves of a gracious
permission to see the interior of Kensington
Palace.  We wished, for the sake of our
readers, as well as ourselves, to see the
pictures  there,  especially those  of  the
Byzantine  and  early German, and   other
painters, that form  the collection of Prince
Louis d'Ottingen Wallerstein ; but we wished,
for our own   sake in particular, to find
ourselves in the rooms which hold them,
for in those Her Majesty passed her childhood; and long before we had other reasons
for wishing to do   so, or dreaming   that
we ever should have, we remember well
the peculiar kind of personal pleasure which
it gave us to see the   future Queen, the
first time we ever did see her, coming



<pb id="p.258" n="258"/>

up a cross path from the Bayswater gate,
with a girl of her own age by her side,
whose hand she was holding, as if she loved
her. It brought to our mind the warmth of
our own juvenile friendships; and made us
fancy that she loved everything else that
we had loved in like measure,-books, trees,
verses, Arabian tales, and the good mother
who had helped to make her so affectionate.
 </p><p> A magnificent footman, in scarlet, came
behind her, with the splendidest pair of
calves, in white stockings, that we ever
beheld. He looked somehow like a gigantic
fairy, personating, for his little lady's sake, the
grandest kind of footman he could think of;
and his calves he seemed to have made out
of a couple of the biggest chiase-lamps in
the possession of the godmother of Cinderella.


   <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>

 As the princess grew up, the world
 seemed never to hear of her, except as it
 wished to hear;-that is to say, in connexion
with her mother; and now it never hears
of  her, but in connexion with children of her
own, and her husband, and her mother still,
and all good household pleasures and hospitalities, and public virtues of a piece with them.
May life ever continue to appear to her
what, indeed, it really is to all who have eyes
for  seeing beyond the surface; namely, a
wondrous fairy  scene, strange, beautiful,
mournful too, yet hopeful of being "happy
ever after" when its story is over; and wise,
meantime, in seeing much where others see
nothing, in shedding its tears patiently, and
in doing its  best to diminish  the tears
around it.
</p><p>Writing  to  his friend, Hannah More,



<pb id="p.260" n="260"/>
from Kensington, on the 21st of July, <date value="1820">1820</date>,
Mr. Wilberforce says, "In consequence of a
very civil message from the Duchess of
Kent, I waited on her this morning. She
received me with her fine animated child on
the floor, by her side, with its playthings,
of which I soon became one.  She was very
civil; but as she did not sit down, I did
not think it right to stay above a quarter
of an hour, and there being but a female
attendant and a footman present, I could not
well get up any topic, so as to carry on a
continued discourse.  She apologized for not
speaking English well enough to talk it; but
intimated a hope that she might talk it
better and longer with me at some future
time. She spoke of her situation (this was,
probably, in reference to the treatment of her
and hers, at the hands of the Prince
      <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>

Regent)   and   her  manner   was    quite
delightful."
 </p><p> Hearty reason has the nation to rejoice,
that neither Mr. Wilberforce nor Miss Hannah More had anything to do with their
Queen's education; though, had the case
been otherwise, we trust that the good sense
which she inherited from both her parents,
would have rendered it harmless.  She had
too much joyfulness, and justice, and universality, in her nature, to allow her to fall into
those supposed-religious, but really profane,
desecrations, both of this world and the
next, which such persons would inflict on us.
  And thus we have a Queen who sees fair
play to all that mean well, and who can rejoice
and grieve impartially with her subjects of
all classes, like a right, sovereign, human
creature; and not stint and begrudge her



<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>

sympathies, like the Queen of a clique in a
corner.
 </p><p> So much for the latest points of remembrance in connexion with the Palace at Kensington. We will now look back a little
in order to finish with those of the Gardens;
for the death of George the Second did not
put an end to the weekly promenades. They
lasted throughout the long reign of his successor, and only terminated with his son's
accession to the Regency. Hence, we may
still fancy all that was brilliant and fashionable, or in any manner distinguished, good
or bad, in the successive generations of the
last half of the eighteenth century, and
the two first decades of the nineteenth,
making its appearance as such in the
Kensington Great Walk, delighting the
scientific eyes of  drapers  and  mantua-
   <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>

makers, and attracting crowds of adorers
from the city.
 </p><p> At the beginning of the new reign, the
promenaders would be much the same as
before, with the addition of a few Germans,
who had come over with the new Queen.
The Queen herself would hardly be there;
for one publicity of expectancy begets another;
and the new sovereigns kept much, and
economically, at home; gave no dinners or
gala-days; nor, though a ball now and then,
even a supper after the ball.
 </p><p> Miss Chudleigh, not yet Duchess of Kingston, was still in request. The young ladies
who have figured as actresses at Holland
House, Lady Susan Fox, and the charming
Lady Sarah Lenox, with whom the young
King had been said to be in love, were,
perhaps, the greatest attractions in the Walk.


<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>

</p><p>There, also, might probably be seen the
beautiful Countess of Waldegrave, an illegitimate Walpole, who, before the marriage-
act had put an end to such ambitions, became the wife of the King's brother, the
Duke of Gloucester, and mother of the late
Duke, not long deceased.  Kitty Clive, the
actress, would also be there, looking more
intelligent than handsome; and the notorious
Kitty Fisher, the Venus of the day, would
contribute a face as insipid as Venus herself
(that is to say, the Venus de Medicis).  Her
charm consisted, we suppose, in the unexpected
things which such a face would utter; we
mean, in the way of slang: a contrast in
which Horace Walpole found something very
bewitching.
  </p><p>This is the lady, we believe, who, by way
of making a sensation, and showing her

    <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>

superiority to vicissitudes, emulated the pearl-
melting of Cleopatra by eating a bank-note
(we forget for what sum) in the guise of a
sandwich. George Selwyn, Lord March, and
such like worthies, would be there as before;
Wilkes also, indulging his gallant squint; and
Bubb Doddington, during the month in which
he was a " young lord" though a corpulent
senior, bigger for his huge, gaudy clothes.
Madame de Boufflers gave a look in from
Paris.  The mysterious phenomenon called
the chevalier, or chevaliere, d'Eon, showed its
doubly-diplomatic face: and Rousseau, who
was in England about this time, might even
have given a pitying, misanthropical glance
down the foolish assemblage.
 </p><p> We know not whether Johnson was ever to
be found in these promenades a little later in
the reign; but very likely he was, considering


<pb id="p.266" n="266"/>

that he was as great, though a somewhat more
frightened admirer of pretty ancles, as his
friend Richardson. And Goldsmith assuredly
would not suffer his blossom-coloured coat
to be lost to the assembled world, while its
lustre was yet upon it. How could the
Woffingtons, and the Lady Cravens and
Bolingbrokes, and charming Mrs. Abington
with her Roxalana nose be there, and
Oliver, emboldened by his coat, not snatch
the fearful joy of deeming himself admired
as well admiring ? He has no time to lose;
for see-the young author of the " School
for Scandal," parliamentary orator and gallant
duellist, is coming up the walk, with his bride
the beauteous Linley on his arm;' and all
hearts will be his, if his little countryman does
not strike first.
 </p><p> A few years later, poor Miss Ray is in

     <pb id="p.267" n="267"/>

danger of being shot, by her lover, the
Reverend Mr. Hackman (as she was afterwards), for coming modestly along, leaning
on the arm  of Lord Sandwich.     General
Burgoyne badly represents the American
War, but not inelegantly the taste for polite
comedy. Charles Fox astonishes his friends,
for a day or so, by appearing with Lords
Carlisle and Essex in red-heeled shoes, and
feathers in his hat.  Burke looks round the
place with an eye to reformation, but a few
years later is for keeping it all in statu quo
at any price, as a rebuke to his brother
reformers at Paris.
 </p><p> Meantime, George, Prince of Wales, has
arrived at "years of indiscretion;" and the
Mary Robinsons, the Crouchs, and the Fitzherberts, pass in fascinating succession down
the Walk.   Then Mrs. Siddons, very respectable

<pb id="p.268" n="268"/>
 and majestic.  Then the lovely
Duchess of Devonshire, poetess, Queen of
Hearts, and carrier of Westminster elections
-the sweetest of stars in the gracefullest of
aristocratic houses.  Then the Duchess of
Gordon, as fond of power for power's sake,
as the  other is for persuasion's.  Then
Warren Hastings and his " elegant Marian,"
sole conqueress (except her sister in jewellery, the Kingston Duchess) of the reputation-loving court samples of Queen Charlotte. Then Miss Farren, an actress, setting
a real example of manners to the polite
world, and escaping from notice into a
coronet!
  </p><p>And now the French Revolution brings an
inundation of emigrants, male and female,
preceded by Egalite, Duke of Orleans, who
is come to add orgies to orgies at Carlton

       <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>

House; and none of them know what to
make of ex-bishop Talleyrand, who represents all parties by turns, and abides for a
while in Kensington, as we have seen,
confounding all notions of old French propriety, by abandoning his cloth and his
gallantries, and paying his debts.
  At this strangest of all epochs in the
history of the world, there might probably
have been seen in these gardens, on one
and the   same  day, in the portentous
year <date value="1791">1791</date>, Wilkes and Wilberforce; George
Rose and Mr. Holcroft; Mr. Reeve and
Mr. Godwin; Burke, Warren Hastings,
and Thomas Paine; Horace Walpole and
Hannah More (whom    he introduces to the
Duke of Queensberry;) Mary Wolstonecroft
and Miss Burney (Madame d'Arblay), the
latter avoiding the former with all her might;


<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>

and the Countess of Albany (the widow
of the Pretender); the Margravine of Anspach; Mrs. Montagu; Mrs. Barbauld;
Mrs. Trimmer; Emma Harte (Lady Hamilton), accompanied by her adoring portrait-
painter, Romney; and poor Madame du Barry,
mistress of the late Louis XV., come to look
after some jewels of which she has been
robbed, and little suspecting she would
return to be guillotined.
  </p><p>The fashions of this half-century, with
the exception of an occasional broad-brimmed
hat, worn both by gentlemen and ladies,
comprised the ugliest that ever were seen.
Head-dresses became monstrous compounds
of pasteboard, flowers, feathers, and pomatum;   the  hoop  degenerated  into little
panniers; and about the year <date value="1770">1770</date>, a set
of travelled fops came up, calling themselves

     <pb id="p.271" n="271"/>

Macaronis, from their intimacy with the
Italian eatable so called, who wore ridiculously
little hats, large pigtails, and tight-fitting
clothes of striped colours. The lesser pigtail,
long or curly, prevailed for a long time among
elderly gentlemen, making a powdered semicircle between the shoulders; a plain cocked-
hat surmounted their heads; and, on a
sudden, at the beginning of the new century,
ladies took to having turbans, surmounted
with ostrich feathers, and bodies literally
without a waist, the girdle coming directly
under the arms. The bosom protruded at
top, as if squeezed out by the girdle-
strings. There was a song in those days,
beginning:
</p><p>

       <quote rend="blockquote"> "Shepherds, I have lost my love:
        Have you seen my Anna ?"</quote>

       <pb id="p.273" n="273"/>

as all changes tend to produce others, and
the middle classes now began to tread closely
in all respects on the heels of the upper,
filling up the vacancies in the Kensington
Garden promenades with too many supplies
from  Marylebone and the City, the promenades themselves came suddenly to nothing.
Their only remnant, if remnant it can be
called (it is rather a select difference, and a
great improvement), is the   congregation,
twice a week, during the summer season, of
a reasonable number of ladies and gentlemen
at the south-eastern junction of the Gardens
and Hyde Park; who, partly walking about,
and partly sitting on chairs, or remaining
outside the garden boundary on horseback,
listen to charming strains of music from
operas and concertos, performed by the band
of one of the regiments of guards.

<pb id="p.272" n="272"/>

 </p><p> This song was parodied by one beginning-
</p><p>
     <quote rend="blockquote">  "Shepherds, I have lost my waist;
         Have you seen my body ?"
</quote>
 </p><p> We remember this dress in our boyhood,
and never have we beheld anything so monstrous.
 </p><p> The French Revolution put an end to
cocked-hats, to pigtails, to hair-powder; and,
by degrees, introduced the classical female
costume that prevailed at the Tuilleries under
the First Consul.  The hoop, under the
regency of the Prince of Wales, disappeared
from its last stronghold, the Court. The Prince
liked to contemplate the shapes of the ladies,
though he had now become willing enough
to disguise his own in stays and trowsers,
which, accordingly, became fashionable; and


<pb id="p.274" n="274"/>

 </p><p> To this novelty, a very agreeable and unexpected one was added not many years since; to
wit, a considerable strip of public flower garden.
The flowers, and the trees also, are labelled
with their botanic as well as popular names;
and as many of both are not common, and,
at the same time are beautiful, not only is
general information diffused, but cultivators
learn what to ask for of gardeners and nurserymen, and gardens in general profit
accordingly.
 </p><p> It is calculated, that England is now
three or four times the country it used to
to be in regard to its shew of flowers, and
that the importation of foreign trees, particularly from America, has given its parks, and
will ultimately give its woods and field-sides,
an addition of autumnal colours, very like
changing its landscape from northern to

     <pb id="p.275" n="275"/>

southern, or from greys and dingies, to reds,
oranges, and gold.
 </p><p> The late public-spirited Mr. Loudon, who
had a main hand in bringing about the
recent improvements of this kind, both here
and elsewhere, got the old wall in the Bayswater Road exchanged for an iron railing,
which gives the wayfarer a pleasant scene of
shrubs and green leaves as he goes along,
instead of dusty old brick-work; and though
too many of the shrubs and new trees,
in the line of the railing, are not yet sufficiently grown to keep up the old sense of seclusion, and so render the walker in the gardens
equally content with the change, a few years
will restore him his satisfaction.  New trees
had become necessary not only in this part of
the gardens, but in the whole of them. Multitudes of the old ones had grown up slender

<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>
and sickly for want of room; and at length were
rotting.  They were thinned off for new
ones; and though a mistake, much to the
distress of Loudon, was made at the head of
the Serpentine, by the erection of a miserable
"dumb-waiter " kind of fountain, dripping
wretchedly on its little shelves, (the chill
English always seem   afraid of making a
good-sized fountain) the sorry trifle is, at.
all events, stopped for the present, and something like a natural spring of water may
perhaps still be looked for, to greet the dusty
turner out of the high-road, and harmonize
with the ever-pleasant swans.
  </p><p> Besides the rarer trees in the strip of
garden-ground properly so called, and the
trees common to woody places in the Gardens
in general, there are some good specimens of
beech here, and some more than usually fine

           <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>

ones, both of the horse-chesnut and the
sweet chesnut.  The horse-chesnuts, thick
with leaves, and throwing up in abundance
their noble pyramidal blossoms, form a beautiful greeting for the pedestrian in spring,
as he comes from Piccadilly towards the
entrance into Kensington High Street.
 </p><p> Ordinary birds of course abound, both
singing and cawing, though it has never been
our good fortune to hear the nightingale.
The return of rooks towards nightfall often
gives Kensington the look of a remote country
town. The nut-hatch has been frequently
caught in the Gardens; it is not improbable
that the rare and beautiful bird the hoopoe
(Upupa epops) may be seen there during
the prevalence of the east winds, which are
understood to drive it hither from the continent; and we ourselves have seen the jay,

<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>
with its lovely delicate blue and other colours,
though it is a bird very shy of observers.
 </p><p> As to fish, all we can say is, that we have
seen boys, with faces no wiser than the fish
they caught, succeed in throwing a number
of " tittle-bats" on the grass by the Serpentine,
where they leaped and gasped out their
wretched little souls with ineffectual efforts to
gulp the air.
 </p><p> A satirical or hypercritical observer of
Kensington might say, that it has a Palace
which is no palace, Gardens which are no
gardens, and a river called the Serpentine,
which is neither serpentine nor a river.  It
is an angular piece of water made (as before
stated) out of some ponds; which ponds, we
have now to add, were made, we believe, out
of a brook which rises in West-End Lane,
Hampstead. The brook makes a considerable
    <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>

plash in that lane in bad weather; and you
may occasionally notice it in dry, looking like
a transparent bit of gutter.  The Serpentine,
which covers fifty acres of ground, is partly
in the Gardens and partly in Hyde Park;
and the division is made by a bridge, which
being itself divided by a fence, accommodates
passengers in two places at once. Boats may
now be hired on it in the summer time, on
the Garden as well as on the Park side of the
bridge.  They enable the catchers of the
tittle-bats to fancy themselves rowers; and
not long since, the fountain above-mentioned
enabled them to fancy that they had seen a
fountain; but for the present, they must
go and study for that purpose the other
drivelling attempts called by that name, in
front of the out-house called the National
Gallery.

<pb id="p.280" n="280"/>
</p><p>
  The most unpretending piece of water is
the great pond, or basin, in front of the
Palace, from the sides of which the principal
walks diverge. In summer time, the refreshment of its appearance is increased by the
hot gravel of the walks; and in winter, the
ear is pleasantly greeted by the tinkling, and
the eye by the crowding, of the happy skaiters,
not the less happy, and very reasonably so,
because the pond is shallow; for a cold bath
in winter time is not to be desired, especially
with ones clothes on; and though life itself is
not to be put into competition with great calls
for its sacrifice, there is something ridiculous, as well as grievous, in losing it by such
a thing as a ducking.
 </p><p> It is pleasant, however, in default of
having a real and a better river at hand,
to walk by the Serpentine in fine weather;
      <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>

for the water flows, and there is air upon it,
and grass is under one's feet, and trees round
about us. With the Hyde Park half of it
we have nothing to do in these pages; nor
is the sense of the pleasure there so sequestered as that in the Gardens. What may
be called the river-side of the Gardens, is on
this account altogether the most agreable;
meaning by river-side, not merely the side of
the water, but the wood in its neighbourhood,
and its sequestered-looking paths.  Prospects
of any kind the Gardens can hardly be said
to possess, for none even of the vistas are
worth mentioning, except that, perhaps, such
as it is, and as topographers have observed,
which looks from one point in this quarter
towards the Palace. Nevertheless, as comparativeness gives value to everything, great
or small, Kensington Gardens are a truly


<pb id="p.282" n="282"/>

valuable possession to the neighbourhood,
and to the metropolis in general. They afford
safe walks to invalids and to children; sequestered ones to lovers of quiet; shades in summertime to the heated; dry passages in winter to
crossers over the district; birds, trees, and
flowers to the lovers of them: and upon the
whole, something altogether different to those
who wish it, from town, from noise, or from
the town's most painful or perplexing sights;
for here, though angling is allowed, which is
a pity and ridiculous, sporting in general is
not. You hear no sound, and see no sight,
to make you wish that the setter of his wits
against hare and pheasant
</p><p>
      <quote rend="blockquote">   "Had shot as he was used to do."
</quote>
 </p><p>The poet may turn his verse, the philosopher his axioms, and the lover his affectionate

     <pb id="p.283" n="283"/>

 thoughts, with no greater interruption
than the call of a bird, or the sound of a
child's voice; and if a foolish old gentleman
is now and then seen haunting a nursery-
maid, or a younger vagabond desecrating
some alcove with the literature of St. Giles's,
we are to comfort ourselves with hoping
that the nursery-maid is laughing at the
venerable Adonis, and that the vagabond,
when he goes home, will get as many
boxes on the ears for loitering by the way,
as he has given causes of trouble to the
sponge of the garden inspector. We must
not expect to be too Paradisaical, even in
Kensington Gardens.
  </p><p>The most affecting consideration suggested
by places like these, is the one which calls to
mind the past splendour and gaiety, the frivolity, the vice, and the virtue also, which


<pb id="p.284" n="284"/>
they have seen; all now gone into another
world, to join the greatest of all publics, the
public of the dead. Rather let us say, of the
departed; for what do we know of the dead,
except that the life has departed out of them ?
The qualities which they evinced while living
were more or less mixed up with their opposites; the gaiety with gloom, the frivolity with
thoughtfulness (for did not all suffer?) the
melancholy with mirth (for did not all enjoy ?)
Even Lord Hervey thought he hated ingratitude and hypocrisy, and perhaps he did so, in
others,thoughhe was not as alive to them as he
ought to have been in his own person. Let us
rest assured that the claims of the dead have
been all since adjusted, and with final evil to
no one; for as they were all created souls, they
were all children of heaven as well as of earth.
Such were they who have gone; such are
  <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>

the like multitudes who are now living, and
such will be those who succeed them. We
may be quite content and happy, both with
the past and the future of Kensington
Palace and all around it, if we think of this,
and at the same time cultivate our health
and our natural cheerfulness, as all gardens,
even formal ones, invite us to do.
 </p><p> The chief abiding thought in any garden
is, or ought to be, a combined consciousness
of the beauty of vegetation and the tranquillizing effect of quiet. This, we doubt not,
is the reflection and the reward of those who
frequent Kensington Gardens in general;
and such of them as meet with this book
will gladly see it finish with a quotation
from a poet, who was one of the truest
brother-lovers of gardens that ever lived, and
also, as his friend Evelyn was here sometimes,


<pb id="p.286" n="286"/>

 we have not the least doubt was a
visitor; nay, would assuredly have visited
them, whether his friend had or not; for
nature was his still greater friend, and every
plant (so strongly he loved it) a sort of
fellow-creature.  You    see  he  cannot help
addressing the trees in their respective social
ranks, after the Tory fashion in which he was
brought up; though no man was less of a
party-man at heart than he, or wished better
to the good and honest of all ranks and
denominations.

 <quote rend="blockquote"> " Hail, old patrician trees, so great and good,
         Hail, ye plebeian underwood,

    And for their quiet nests and plenteous food,
         Pay with their grateful voice.

  " Here Nature does a house for me erect,
         Nature, the fairest architect,
              <pb id="p.287" n="287"/>

        Who those fond artists does despise,
 That can the fair and living trees neglect,
        Yet the dead timber prize.


"Here let me, careless and unthoughtful lying,
      Hear the soft winds, above me flying,
      With all their wanton boughs dispute,
 And the more tuneful birds to both replying,
      Nor be, myself too, mute.


" A silver stream shall roll his waters near,
      Gilt with the sunbeams here and there,
      On whose enamell'd bank I'll walk,
 And see how prettily they smile, and hear
      How prettily they talk.


" Ah, wretched and too solitary he,
      Who loves not his own company!
      He'll find the weight of't many a day,

And again, in his Essay entitled "The

<p>LORD GEORGE BENTINCK: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY. Bythe RIGHT HON. B. DISRAELI, M.P. Fifth and cheaper
     Edition, Revised. Post 8vo. 10s. 6d.</p>
    <p>' This biography cannot fail to attract the deep attention of the public. We are bound
to say, that as a political biography we have rarely, if ever, met with a book more dexterously
handled, or more replete with interest. The history of the famous session of <date value="1846">1846</date>, as written by Disraeli in that brilliant and pointed style of which he is so consummate a master, is deeply interesting. He has traced this memorable struggle with a vivacity and power
unequalled as yet in any narrative of Parliamentary proceedings."-Blackwood's Mag.
  </p><p>  " Mr. Disraeli's tribute to the memory of his departed friend is as graceful and as
touching as it is accurate and impartial. No one of Lord George Bentinck's colleagues
could have been selected, who, from his high literary attainments, his personal intimacy, and
party associations, would have done such complete justice to the memory of a friend and
Parliamentary associate. Mr. Disraeli has here presented us with the very type and embodiment of what history should be. His sketch of the condition of parties is seasoned with
some of those piquant personal episodes of party manoeuvres and private intrigues, in the
author's happiest and most captivating vein, which convert the dry details of politics into a
sparkling and agreeable narrative."--Morning Herald.

</title>
   </p><p>"These volumes contain much valuable matter.    The letters which George, first
Marquis of Buckingham, laid by as worthy of preservation have some claim to see the light,
for he held more than one office in the State, and consequently kept up a communication with
a great number of historical personages. He himself was twice Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,
first, under Lord Rockingham, and secondly, under Pitt; his most constant correspondents
were his two brothers, William and Thomas Grenville, both of whom spent the chief part of
their lives in official employments, and of whom the former is sufficiently known to fame as
Lord Grenville. The staple of the book is made up of these family documents, but there are
also to be found interspersed with the Grenville narrative, letters from every man of note,
dating from the death of the elder Pitt to the end of the century. There are three periods
upon which they shed a good deal of light. The formation of the Coalition Ministry in <date value="1783">1783</date>
the illness of the King in <date value="1788">1788</date>, and the first war with Republican France. Lord Grenville's
letters to his brother afford a good deal of information on the machinations of the Prince's
party, and the conduct of the Prince and the Duke of York during the King's illness."-
The Times.
  </p><p> " A very remarkable and valuable publication. The Duke of Buckingham has himself
undertaken the task of forming a history from the papers of his grandfather and great-
uncle, the Earl Temple (first Marquis of Buckingham), and Lord Grenville, of the days of
the second Wm. Pitt. The letters which are given to the public in these volumes, extend
over an interval commencing with <date value="1782">1782</date>, and ending with <date value="1800">1800</date>. In that interval, events
occurred which can never lose their interest as incidents in the history of England. The
Coalition Ministry and its dismissal by the King-the resistance of the Sovereign and Pitt
to the efforts of the discarded ministers to force themselves again into office-the great constitutional question of the Regency which arose upon the King's disastrous malady-the
contest upon that question between the heir apparent and the ministers of the Crown-the
breaking out of the French Revolution, and the-consequent entrance of England upon the
great European war,-these, with the Union with Ireland, are political movements every
detail of which possesses the deepest interest. In these volumes, details, then guarded with
the most anxious care from all eyes but those of the privileged few, are now for the first time
given to the public. The most secret history of many of the transactions is laid bare. It is
not possible to conceive contemporary history more completely exemplified. From such
materials it was not possible to form a work that would not possess the very highest interest.
The Duke of Buckingham has, however, moulded his materials with no ordinary ability and
skill. The connecting narrative is written both with judgment and vigour-not unfrequently
in a style which comes up to the highest order of historical composition-especially in some
of the sketches of personal character. There is scarcely a single individual of celebrity
throughout the period from <date value="1782">1782</date> to <date value="1800">1800</date> who is not introduced into these pages; amongst
others, besides the King and the various members of the royal family, are Rockingham,
Shelburne, North, Thurlow, Loughborough, Fox, Pitt, Sheridan, Burke, Portland, Sydney,
Fitzwilliam, Tierney, Buckingham, Grenville, Grey, Malmesbury, Wilberforce, Burdett,
Fitzgibbon, Grattan, Flood, Cornwallis, the Beresfords, the Ponsonbys, the Wellesleys, &amp;c."

     GENERAL SIR W. NOTT, G.C.B., COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF CANDAHAR AND ENVOY AT THE COURT OF LUCKNOW. EDITED BY J. H.
     STOCQUELER, ESQ., at the request of the Daughters of the late General,
     from Private Papers and Official Documents in their possession. 2 vols.
     8vo., with Portrait. 28s. bound.</p>

 <p>    "One of the most valuable and interesting books that can ever claim a permanent plaee
in a British library."-Standard.
 </p><p>   " These highly interesting volumes give a valuable contribution to the history of India
and an admirable portrait of a most distinguished officer."-John Bull.
   </p><p> " These Memoirs with the Correspondence included in them will do that justice to the
part played by Sir W. Nott in the Affghan war, which it is undeniable preceding works have
failed to do."-Athen&#x00E6;um.
   </p><p> " These memoirs of General Nott, whom the editor very justly describes as a ' model
officer,' have been given to the world at the instigation of the hero's surviving daughters. A
more graceful tribute of dutiful affection to the memory of a departed parent it would be
difficult to name. It is at once a graphic picture of the soldier's career, and a noble monu.
ment of his fame. The work issues from the press at a very fortunate moment. The life of
an officer who followed in the footsteps of Wellington, making the Despatches of that
illustrious warrior his continual study, will be welcomed by many an aspirant for military
renown at this exciting crisis. The volumes form a valuable contribution to the biographical
stores of the age. To the young soldier, in particular, they will form a most valuable guide,
worthy to be placed by the side of the Despatches of the great Duke of Wellington."-Messenger.
   </p><p> " When the late General Nott died, the ' Quarterly Review' expressed a hope that some
means would be taken for giving publicity to his private letters and official correspondence,
because they so completely illustrated his high and chivalrous character, while a memoir of
his life would hold out so admirable a lesson to British statesmen, and so good an example to
young officers. We are happy, therefore, to find that, under the able editorship of Mr.
Stocqueler, the whole of the most valuable portion of the general's correspondence has just
been published in two handsome volumes, which comprise also a most interesting memoir of
the gallant hero of Candahar, giving a complete account of the stirring campaign in Affghanistan, and throwing much light upon many important points hitherto left in obscurity. The
work will be eagerly welcomed by all-more particularly by military readers and those interested in our Indian dominions."-Globe.
   </p><p> " A biography of a first-rate soldier, and a highly honourableman. The book will often be
appealed to as a standard authority.  A valuable and most authentic adition is here
furnished to the true history of transactions which will ever hold a prominent place in the

great bulk of those hasty compilations which a sudden demand has called into existence-is

  </p><p> " These volumes constitute a work for the future as well as for the present, in other
words, a valuable library book as well as a book of great contemporaneous interest. Their
permanent value they derive chiefly from the deep research and extensive and minute investigation of their first author, Sir James Porter, their present interest from the acute and
lively treatment of the events of the day by his grandson and continuator. In fact, we know
not where to find so perfect an account of Turkey in all its relations with the rest of the
world, military, political, and, above all, commercial."-Standard.
 </p><p>  "This highly interesting work consists of two parts. The first volume, after a memoir
of Sir James Porter, proceeds to give a general description of the Turkish Empire, of its
natural and industrial productions, and its commerce, a sketch of its history from the invasion of Europe to the reign of Sultan Mahmud II., and an account of the religion and
the civil institutions of the Turks, and of their manners and customs, chiefly from the
data supplied by the papers of Sir James Porter. In the second volume we are made acquainted with Turkey as it is; the religious and civil government of Turkey, its Legislature,
the state of education in the Empire, its finances, its military and naval strength, and the
social condition of the Turks, are all in succession brought under review. The work gives a fuller
and more life-like picture of the present state of the Ottoman Empire, than any other work with
which we are acquainted."-John Bull.
   </p><p> " No publication upon the state and prospects of the Ottoman Empire, with which we
are acquainted can compare with the work now under notice for general utility. In addition
to investigations into the legislature of Turkey, its civil and religious government, its
educational institutions, and the system of instruction, its finances, military and naval
resources, and the social condition of the people, ample details are given of its history, and
a short account of the progress of the actual struggle. These researches are interspersed with
journals and letters, which impart a charming interest to the volumes. We hail the appearance of these volumes with satisfaction, as accurate information both on the history and the
actual condition of Turkey is much needed. Good books are ever welcome, and this is a good
book, coming into our possession at the critical moment when it is most required."-Messenger.

<p>THE LIFE OF MARIE DE MEDICIS, QUEEN OF

    By MISS PARDOE, Author of "Louis XIV, and the Court of France, in
    the 17th Century," &amp;c. Second Edition. 3 large vols. 8vo. with fine
    Portraits.</p>
 <p>   "A fascinating book. The history of such a woman as the beautiful, impulsive, earnest,
and affectionate Marie de Medicis could only be done justice to by a female pen, impelled by
all the sympathies of womanhood, but strengthened by an erudition by which it is not in
every case accompanied. In Miss Pardoe the unfortunate Queen has found both these
requisites, and theresult has been a biography combining the attractiveness of romance with
the reliableness of history, and which, taking a place midway between the ' frescoed galleries '
of Thierry, and the ' philosophic watch-tower of Guizot,' has all the pictorial brilliancy of
the one, with much of the reflective speculation of the other."-Daily News.
  </p><p> " A work of high literary and historical merit. Rarely have the strange vicissitudes of
romance been more intimately blended with the facts of real history than in the life of Marie
de Medicis; nor has the difficult problem of combining with the fidelity of biography the
graphic power of dramatic delineation been often more successfully solved than by the
talented author of the volumes before us. As a personal narrative, Miss Pardoe's admirable
biography possesses the most absorbing and constantly sustained interest; as a historical
record of the events of which it treats, its merit is of no ordinary description."-

 <p> The Baroness d'Oberkirch being the intimate friend of the Empress of Russia,
wife of Paul I., and the confidential companion of the Duchess of Bourbon, her
facilities for obtaining information respecting the most private affairs of the
principal Courts of Europe, render her Memoirs unrivalled as a book of interesting anecdotes of the royal, noble and other celebrated individuals who flourished
on the continent during the latter part of the last century. Among the royal personages introduced to the reader in this work, are Louis XVI., Marie Antoinette,
Philip Egalite, and all the Princes of France then living-Peter the Great, the
Empress Catherine, the Emperor Paul, and his sons Constantine aud Alexander,
of Russia-Frederick the Great and Prince Henry of Prussia-the Emperor
Joseph II. of Austria-Gustavus III, of Sweden-Princess Christina of Saxony
-Sobieski, and Czartoriski of Poland-and the      Princes of Brunswick and
Wurtemburg. Among the most remarkable persons are the Princes and
Princesses de Lamballe, de Ligne and Galitzin-the Dukes and Duchesses de
Choiseul, de Mazarin, de Boufflers, de la Vallidre, de Guiche, de Penthievre, and
de Polignac-Cardinal de Rohan, Marshals Biron and d'Harcourt, Count de
Staremberg, Baroness de Krudener, Madame Geoffrin, Talleyrand, Mirabeau, and
Necker-with Count Cagliostro, Mesner, Vestris, and Madame Mara; and the
work also includes such literary celebrities as Voltaire, Condorcet, de la Harpe,
de Beaumarchais, Rousseau, Lavater, Bernouilli, Raynal, de l'Epee, Huber,
Gothe, Wieland, Malesherbes, Marmontel, de Stael and de Genlis; with some
singular disclosures respecting those celebrated Englishwomen, Elizabeth Chudleith, Duchess of Kingston, and Lady Craven, Margravine of Anspach.
 </p><p>  "A keen observer, and by position thrown in the high places of the world, the
Baroness d'Oberkirch was the very woman to write Memoirs that would interest future
generations. We commend these volumes most heartily to every reader. They are a
perfect magazine of pleasant anecdotes and interesting characteristic things. We lay
down these charming volumes with regret. They will entertain the most fastidious

 </p><p>  "This is a very complete and cleverly-written life of the illustrious sister of Francis I.,
and it may be said of her that the varied and interesting stores of French history offer no
theme more worthy of research and study than the career of this great princess, who exercised so potent an influence over the politics and manners of the age of which she was
herself the brightest ornament. The published and manuscript documents and letters
relating to the life of Marguerite of Navarre, and which are indispensable to a correct
biography of this queen, are widely dispersed.  The author has spared no cost or trouble in
endeavouring to obtain all that were likely to elucidate her character and conduct. She has
furnished us with a very interesting and graphic sketch of the singular events and the
important personages who took part in them during this stormy and remarkable period of
French and English history."-Observer.
  </p><p> "This is a very useful and amusing book. It is a good work, very well done. The
authoress is quite equal in power and grace to Bliss Strickland. She must have spent a
great time and labour in collecting the information, which she imparts in an easy and
agreeable manner. It is difficult to lay down her book after having once begun it. This is
owing partly to the interesting nature of the subject, partly to the skilful manner in which it
has been treated. No other life of Marguerite has yet been published, even in France.
Indeed, till Louis Philippe ordered the collection and publication of manuscripts relating to
the History of France, no such work could be published. It is difficult to conceive how,
under any circumstances, it could have been done better."-Standard.
  </p><p> " There are few names more distinguished that that of Marguerite d'Angouldme in the
range of female biography, and the writer of this work has done well in taking up a
subject so copious and attractive.  It is altogether an interesting and well-written
biography."-Literary Gazette.
  </p><p> " A work of high literary and historic merit. It is full of absorbing and constantly
sustained interest. In these volumes will be found not alone an incalculable amount of
historical information, but a store of reading of a charming and entrancing character, and we
heartily commend them as deserving general popularity."-Sunday Times.
  </p><p> " A work which is most acceptable as an addition to our historical stores, and which will
place the author in a foremost rank among our female writers of the royal biography of their
own sex."-John Bull..

with the attention it merits can fail to acquire a complete and accurate knowledge of the
interesting life of the best and most graceful woman who ever filled a conspicuous place in
the history of mankind."-Morning Herald.
  </p><p> " This life of Marguerite d'Angouleme is entitled to high rank amongst the many excellent memoirs of illustrious women for which we have been largely indebted to female
authorship. The subject is eminently attractive."-Morning Post.
   </p><p>"Throughout these volumes the most intense interest is maintained. Like Carlyle,
Miss Freer has written as one whose thoughts and sympathies became assimilated to the
age. The biography of Marguerite of Navarre is a work upon which the author has.
lavished all the resources of her genius."-Britannia.</p>

 </p><p>   "We hope these volumes will be perused by all our readers. They are extremely
interesting, and not only give an account of Abernethy, which cannot fail to be read with
benefit, but they discuss incidentally many questions of medicine and medical polity. Mr.
Macilwain is fond of anecdotes, and has inserted a great number; this does not render his

of the Turkish Cossacks, a corps organised by himself. The volumes on the Moslem and
the Christian, partly fact and partly fiction, written by him, and translated by Colonel
Szyrma, display very well the literary spirit of the soldier. They are full of the adventures
and emotions that belong to love and war; they treat of the present time, they introduce
many existing people, and have the Danubian principalities for scene of action. Here are
sources of popularity which the book fairly claims. As a translation, it is excellent.-

and made his way on horseback to Valparaiso across the Cordilleras-a winter passage full of
difficulty and danger. From Valparaiso he sailed to California, and visited San Francisco,
Sacramento, and the mining districts generally. Thence he steered his course to the South

thence to Sydney, marching through the Murray Valley, and inspecting the Adelaide district;
From Australia he dashed onward to Java, riding through the interior, and taking a general
survey of Batavia, with a glance at Japan and the Japanese. An active, intelligent, observant
man, the notes he made of his adventures are full of variety and interest. His descriptions of
places and persons are lively, and his remarks on natural productions and the phenomena of
earth, sea, and sky are always sensible, and made with a view to practical results. Those

<head>DARIEN; OR, THE MERCHANT PRINCE. BY ELIOT
    WARBURTON. Second Edition. 3 vols. post 8vo.</head>
  <p>  "The scheme for the colonization of Darien by Scotchmen, and the opening of a communication between the East and West across the Isthmus of Panama, furnishes the foundation of this story, which is in all respects worthy of the high reputation which the author of
the ' Crescent and the Cross' had already made for himself. The early history of the ' Merchant
Prince' introduces the reader to the condition of Spain under the Inquisition; the portraitures
of Scottish life which occupy a prominent place in the narrative, are full of spirit; the scenes
In America exhibit the state of the natives of the New World at that period; the daring deeds
of the Buccaneers supply a most romantic element in the story; and an additional interest
is infused into it by the introduction of the various celebrated characters of the period, such
as Law, the French financier, and Paterson, the founder of the Bank of England. All these
varied ingredients are treated with that brilliancy of style and powerful descriptive talent, by
which the pen of Eliot Warburton was so eminently distinguished."-John Bull.

  <p>This popular periodical, which has now been established a quarter of a century,

Independently of a succession of Original Papers on innumerable interesting subjects, Personal Narratives, Historical Incidents, Correspondence, etc., each number comprises

New Publications, eitherimmediately relating to the Army or Navy, or involving

   </p><p> "This is confessedly one of the ablest and most attractive periodicals of which the
British press can boast, presenting a wide field of entertainment to the general as well as
professional reader. The suggestions for the benefit of the two services are distinguished
by vigour of sense, acute and practical observation, an ardent love of discipline, tempered by
a high sense of justice, honour, and a tender regard for the welfare and comfort of our soldiers
and seamen. "-Globe.
  </p><p>  " At the head of those periodicals which furnish usefu and valuable information to
their peculiar classes of readers, as well as amusement to the general body of the public,
must be placed the ' United Service Magazine, and Naval and Military Journal.' It numbers
among its contributors almost all those gallant spirits who have done no less honour
to their country by their swords than by their pens, and abounds with the most interesting
discussions on naval and military affairs, and stirring narratives of deeds of arms in all
parts of the world. Every information of value and interest to both the Services is culled
with the greatest diligence from every available source, and the correspondence of various
distinguished officers which enrich its pages is a feature of great attraction. In short, the
' United Service Magazine' can be recommended to every reader who possesses that attach-
ment to his country which should make him look with the deepest interest on its naval and
military resources."-Sun.

Service, and take a world of pains to inform themselves of all the goings on, the modes and
fashions, the movements and adventures connected with ships and barracks, this periodical
is indispensable. It is a repertory of facts and criticisms-narratives of past experience, and
fictions that are as good as if they were true-tables and returns-new inventions and new
books bearing upon the army and navy-correspondence crowded with intelligence-and
sundry unclaimed matters that lie in close neighbourhood with the professions, and contribute
more or less to the stock of general useful information."-Atlas.

  "Madame D'Arblay lived to be a classic. Time set on her fame, before
she went hence, that seal which is seldom set except on the fame of the departed. All those whom we have been accustomed to revere as intellectual
patriarchs seemed children when compared with her; for Burke had sat up
all night to read her writings, and Johnson had pronounced her superior to
Fielding, when Rogers was still a schoolboy, and Southey still in petticoats.
Her Diary is written in her earliest and best manner; in true woman's English, clear, natural, and lively. It ought to be consulted by every person who
wishes to be well acquainted with the history of our literature and our
manners."

 " This work may be considered a kind of supplement to Boswell's Life of

EMBELLISHED WITH PORTRAITS OF EVERY QUEEN,
    BEAUTIFULLY ENGRAVED FROM THE MOST AUTHENTIC SOURCES.

</p><p>  IN announcing a cheap Edition of this important and interesting work, which has been considered unique in biographical
literature, the publishers again beg to direct attention to the
following extract from  the author's preface:-" A revised
edition of the 'Lives of the Queens of England, embodying
the important collections which have been brought to light
since the appearance of earlier impressions, is now offered to
the world, embellished with Portraits of every Queen, from
authentic and properly verified sources.  The series, commencing with the consort of William the Conqueror, occupies
that most interesting and important period of our national chronology, from the death of the last monarch of the Anglo-Saxon
line, Edward the Confessor, to the demise of the last sovereign
of the royal house of Stuart, Queen Anne, and comprises therein
thirty queens who have worn the crown-matrimonial, and four
the regal diadem of this realm. We have related the parentage
of every queen, described her education, traced the influence
of family connexions and national habits on her conduct, both
public and private, and given a concise outline of the domestic,
as well as the general history of her times, and its effects on
her character, and we have done so with singleness of heart,
unbiassed by selfish interests or narrow views.  Such as they
were in life we have endeavoured to portray them, both in

  the development of thefacts. Their sayings, their doings, their
  manners, their costume, will be found faithfully chronicled in
  this work, which also includes the most interesting of their
  letters. The hope that the ' Lives of the Queens of England'
  might be regarded as a national work, honourable to the
  female character, and generally useful to society, has encouraged us to the completion of the task."

    " These volumes have the fascination of romance united to the integrity of
 history. The work is written by a lady of considerable learning, indefatigable
 industry, and careful judgment. All these qualifications for a biographer and
 an historian she has brought to bear upon the subject of her volumes, and from
 them has resulted a narrative interesting to all, and more particularly interesting to that portion of the community to whom the more refined researches of
 literature afford pleasure and instruction. The whole work should be read,
 and no doubt will be read, by all who are anxious for information. It is a lucid
arrangement of facts, derived from authentic sources, exhibiting a combination
of industry, learning, judgment, and impartiality, not often met with in biographers of crowned heads."

   "A remarkable and truly great historical work. In this series of biographies,
 in which the severe truth of history takes almost the wildness of romance, it is
 the singular merit of Miss Strickland that her research has enabled her to throw
 new light on many doubtful passages, to bring forth fresh facts, and to render
 every portion of our annals which she has described an interesting and valuable
 study. She has given a most valuable contribution to the history of England,
 and we have no hesitation in affirming that no one can be said to possess an
 accurate knowledge of the history of the country who has not studied this truly
 national work, which, in this new edition, has received all the aids that further
 research on the part of the author, and of embellishment on the part of the publishers, could tend to make it still more valuable, and still more attractive, than
 it had been in its original form."

 PEPYS' DIARY AND CORRESPONDENCE.</head>
<p>
 Now ready, a New and Cheap Edition, printed uniformly with the
 last edition of EVELYN'S DIARY, and comprising all the recent
 Notes and Emendations, Indexes, &amp;c., in Four Volumes, post octavo,
 with Portraits, price 6s. per Volume, handsomely bound, of the
    </p><p>   DIARY AND CORRESPONDENCE OF

 SAMUEL PEPYS, F.R.S.,
   SECRETARY TO THE ADMIRALTY IN THE REIGNS OF CHARLES II.
                       AND JAMES II.
      EDITED BY RICHARD LORD BRAYBROOKE.


 </p><p> The authority of PEPYS, as an historian and illustrator of
a considerable portion of the seventeenth century, has been
so fully acknowledged by every scholar and critic, that it
is now scarcely necessary to remind the reader of the advantages he possessed for producing the most complete and
trustworthy record of events, and the most agreeable picture
of society and manners, to be found in the literature of any
nation. In confidential communication with the reigning
sovereigns, holding high official employment, placed at the
head of the Scientific and Learned of a period remarkable
for intellectual impulse, mingling in every circle, and observing everything and everybody whose characteristics were
worth noting down; and possessing, moreover, an intelligence peculiarly fitted for seizing the most graphic points in
whatever he attempted to delineate, PEPYS may be considered
the most valuable as well as the most entertaining of our
National Historians.
  </p><p>A New and Cheap Edition of this work, comprising all the
restored passages and the additional annotations that have
been called for by the vast advances in antiquarian and historical knowledge during the last twenty years, will doubtless
be regarded as one of the most agreeable additions that could
be made to the library of the general reader.
</p>

<pb id="p.xxx" n="xxx"/>

  <p>   OPINIONS OF THE PRESS ON PEPYS' DIARY.
                   FROM THE EDINBURGH REVIEW.
  " Without making any exception in favour of any other production
of ancient or modern diarists, we unhesitatingly characterise this journal
as the most remarkable production of its kind which has ever been
given to the world. Pepys' Diary makes us comprehend the great
historical events of the age, and the people who bore a part in them,
and gives us more clear glimpses into the true English life of the times
than all the other memorials of them that have come down to our own."
 </p><p>                 FROM THE QUARTERLY REVIEW.
  "There is much in Pepys' Diary that throws a distinct and vivid
light over the picture of England and its government during the period
succeeding the Restoration. If, quitting the broad path of history, we
look for minute information concerning ancient manners and customs,
the progress of arts and sciences, and the various branches of antiquity,
we have never seen a mine so rich as these volumes. The variety of
Pepys' tastes and pursuits led him into almost every department of
life. He was a man of business, a man of information, a man of whim,
and, to a certain degree, a man of pleasure. He was a statesman, a
bel-esprit, a virtuoso, and a connoisseur. His curiosity made him an
unwearied, as well as an universal, learner, and whatever he saw found
its way into his tablets."
 </p><p>                      FROM THE ATHEN&#x00C6;UM.
  "The best book of its kind in the English language. The new
matter is extremely curious, and occasionally far more characteristic
and entertaining than the old. The writer is seen in a clearer light,
and the reader is taken into his inmost soul. Pepys' Diary is the ablest
picture of the age in which the writer lived, and a work of standard importance in English literature."
  </p><p>                     FROM THE EXAMINER.
  "We place a high value on Pepys' Diary as the richest and most
delightful contribution ever made to the history of English life and
manners in the latter half of the seventeenth century."
  </p><p>                     FROM TAIT'S MAGAZINE.
  "We owe Pepys a debt of gratitude for the rare and curious information he has bequeathed to us in this most amusing and interesting work.
His Diary is valuable, as depicting to us many of the most important
characters of the times. Its author has bequeathed to us the records of
his heart-the very reflection of his energetic mind; and his quaint but
happy narrative clears up numerous disputed points-throws light into
many of the dark corners of history, and lays bare the hidden substratum
of events which gave birth to, and supported the visible progress of, the
nation."
     </p><p>                 FROM THE MORNING POST.
  "Of all the records that have ever been published, Pepys' Diary
gives us the most vivid and trustworthy picture of the times, and the
clearest view of the state of English public affairs and of English
society during the reign of Charles II. We see there, as in a map,
the vices of the monarch, the intrigues of the Cabinet, the wanton follies
of the court, and the many calamities to which the nation was subjected
during the memorable period of fire, plague, and general licentiousness."

 </p><p>  " Mrs. Hall's work presents a clear and connected series of records of the early
 female sovereigns of England, of whom only a few scattered anecdotes have
 hitherto been familiarly known to general readers. The book is of great interest,
 as containing many notices of English life and manners in the remote times of
 our British, Roman, Saxon, and Danish ancestors."

 should take its place by the side of Miss Strickland's Lives of the Queens.'"
     </p><p>                           OBSERVER.
   "Of all our female historico-biographical writers, Mrs. Hall seems to us to be
 one of the most painstaking, erudite, and variously and profoundly accomplished.
 Her valuable volumes contain not only the lives of the Queens before the Conquest, but a very excellent history of England previously to the Norman
 dynasty."
   </p><p>    BELL'S MESSENGER.
 " These interesting volumes have been compiled with judgment, discretion,
and taste. Mrs. Hall has spared neither pains nor labour to make her history
worthy of the characters she has essayed to illustrate. The book is, in every
sense, an addition of decided value to the annals of the British people."
    </p><p>                   NEW QUARTERLY REVIEW.
   "These volumes have long been a desideratum, and will be hailed as a useful,

intended as a companion to the recent edition of Pepys, and presents similar claims
to interest and notice. Evelyn was greatly above the vast majority of his contemporaries, and the Diary which records the incidents in his long life, extending
over the greater part of a century, is deservedly esteemed one of the most valuable
and interesting books in the language. Evelyn took part in the breaking out of
the civil war against Charles I., and he lived to see William of Orange ascend the
throne. Through the days of Strafford and Laud, to those of Sancroft and Ken, he
was the steady friend of moderation and peace in the English Church.  He
interceded alike for the royalist and the regicide; he was the correspondent of
Cowley, the patron of Jeremy Taylor, the associate and fellow-student of Boyle;
and over all the interval between Vandyck and Kneller, between the youth of
Milton and the old age of Dryden, poetry and the arts found him an intelligent
adviser, and a cordial friend. There are, on the whole, very few men of whom
England has more reason to be proud. He stands among the first in the list of
Gentlemen. We heartily commend so good an edition of this English classic."-

lives are nearly all connected with foreign nations. Their biographies, consequently, afford us a glimpse of the manners and customs of the chief European
kingdoms, a circumstance which not only gives to the work the charm of variety,
but which is likely to render it peculiarly useful to the general reader, as it links
together by association the contemporaneous history of various nations.  We
