<p>WE know very little about the origin and first settlement
of the Middle Saxons, though their name in itself tells
us something. It shows us that the tribe which occupied
the land between the river Brent and the walls of London
was distinct from that which settled itself beyond the Lea.
What its original name was we know not. Its situation,
after the arrival of the tribe, between Essex and Wessex,
the East Saxons and the West Saxons, caused it to
assume the new appellation of the Middle Saxons.
Beyond this meagre fact, for the Middle Saxons are not
named in the Chronicle of the Conquest, we only know
that they were very few in number, a mere handful, in a
backward state as regards civilisation, chiefly settled
along the line of the old Roman roads, and the banks of
the Thames, their villages half hidden by the great forest
which spread over all the hills from Hampstead to St.
Albans. In name, at least, we have still the North Haw
and the South Haw: we have still the Highgate and the
Southgate, and the Hatch by the Coln: we recognise the
oak in Acton and the ash in Ashford, and the thorn in
Elthorn. Hounslow and Willesden are in the woods,



<pb n="2" id="p.2"/>

but there are cleared farms at Harmond's Worth and
Isleworth and Hanworth, and open fields at Enfield and
Hadley and Finchley. Of the people we learn very
little from the local names. The Saxon marks are very
sparingly represented. When the "ing" does occur it is
generally followed by "ton " or " don," town or down,
as in <placeName key="Islington">Islington</placeName> and <placeName key="Arlington">Arlington</placeName>, in <placeName key="Hillingdon">Hillingdon</placeName> and
<placeName key="Newington">Newington</placeName>, in <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> and <placeName key="Teddington">Teddington</placeName>.   Fields
and fords and homes and greens are numerous, but
Ealing, Yeading, and Charing are alone among the
Middle Saxon family names. The population must
have been extremely small, even down to the time of
the Norman Conquest. If we may judge by the size of
the parishes, it is clear that inhabitants were few and
far between.</p>
 <p> The county was divided, at the time of the Domesday
Survey, into six hundreds. Of these the smallest were
along the river, namely, <placeName key="Iselworth">Iselworth</placeName> and <placeName key="Spelthorn">Spelthorn</placeName>. But
<placeName key="Gore">Ossulston</placeName>, which extended round the west, north, and
east sides of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, was of great size, as were <placeName key="Edmonton">Edmonton</placeName>, <placeName key="Elthorn">Elthorn</placeName>, and <placeName key="Gore">Gore</placeName>. We may therefore safely conclude that the population was greater by the river bank,
and less to the north and north-west of the city, where
the holdings were altogether inland. In modern lists of
the hundreds of Middlesex <placeName key="Ossulston">Ossulston</placeName> has no place.
<placeName key="Ossulston">Kensington</placeName> was an ancient division, formed when the
suburbs became populous, with the three other districts
of <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, <placeName key="Finsbury">Finsbury</placeName>, and the Tower. The last-named,
now the Tower Hamlets, comprised simply the great
parish of <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName>, whose very size shows us how few
were the inhabitants when parochial boundaries were
fixed.  The whole number of the tenants-in-chief in
<placeName key="Middlesex">Middlesex</placeName> in <date value="1087">1087</date> was only twenty-four, and the greater
part of the county, in which the king had not a single






                   <pb n="3" id="p.3"/>

manor,<note place="foot" n="1">See vol. i. chapter iv.</note> was in the hands of the church, the bishop and
canons of St. Paul's, the abbeys of Westminster and
Barking, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, being the
chief landowners.</p>
  <p>If we go further and compare the condition of places
near the river with places more inland, we find that in <placeName key="Enfield">Enfield</placeName> and <placeName key="Isleworth">Isleworth</placeName> there were exactly the same number
of people, namely, 114; but <placeName key="Enfield">Enfield</placeName> is five times the size
of <placeName key="Isleworth">Isleworth</placeName>. Where the manors and parishes, for the
manors and parishes are nearly always conterminous, are
very large, we are justified in assuming that the local
population was small. Such places as <placeName key="Harrow">Harrow</placeName>, <placeName key="Harrow">Hanwell</placeName>,
<placeName key="Hendon">Hendon</placeName>, and <placeName key="Kingsbury">Kingsbury</placeName>, with a vast area, had little
churches and little churchyards, but fed flocks of pigs of
enormous size under the beeches and oaks of the adjoining woods. Harrow and Enfield are recorded to
have had pannage each for 2000 hogs, 500 were fed at
<placeName key="Harmondsworth">Harmondsworth</placeName>, and 400 at <placeName key="Hayes">Hayes</placeName>. When Fitzstephen
writes, in the reign of Henry II., of the <quote>immense forest</quote>
and the <quote>densely-wooded thickets</quote>" of Middlesex, he
uses no exaggeration: and it is told us of Leofric, abbot
of St. Albans towards the close of the tenth century,
that he caused the trees to be cut away for a distance of
thirty feet on each side of the road from <placeName key="London">London</placeName> that
they should not conceal robbers.</p>
  <p>The suppression of the monasteries, which had so great
an effect in the city, made little difference to the scattered inhabitants of the country. The priory of <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName> had great estates, but the knights probably had
little contact with their farmers at <placeName key="Harefield">Harefield</placeName> or <placeName key="Cranford">Cranford</placeName>,
except to receive their rents. The abbot of the Holy
Trinity at Rouen built himself such a barn at <placeName key="Harmondsworth">Harmondsworth</placeName> as would enable him to store his tithes for several

years at a time.<note place="foot" n="2">It is described and figured by Mr. Hartshorne in the ' Transactions' of
  the <placeName key="London">London</placeName> and Middlesex Society, iv. 417. It is 192 feet in length by
  36 feet 9 inches in width, and 39 feet in height.</note>     The  archbishop seldom   visited
Harrow, and his mansion at Headstone was often or
generally let. <note place="foot" n="3">There is another immense barn at Headstone, 147 feet 8 inches long
  by 38 feet 8 inches wide. 'Transactions,' iii. 188.</note>  The villagers of <placeName key="Feltham">Feltham</placeName>  were little
benefited by their land being held from the hospital of
St. Giles.<note place="foot" n="4">See below, chapter xxi.</note> There is not an old castle within the boundaries of the county, if we except a part of the Tower of
London. There is not a single manor house of the thirteenth, fourteenth, or even the fifteenth century. The
clerical and monastic landlords were mainly absentees,
and the change of the dissolution was chiefly felt in an
immediate extension of the suburbs near the city, and
the transformation of the distant and unvisited farms of
canons and abbots into the villas of wealthy aldermen.
The king, too, acquired in Hampton Court a palace
beyond the bounds of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and
a few great noblemen came by degrees to form parks
and build mansions, like Syon House, or Chiswick, or
Canons. The nobility of Middlesex was, however, at
first confined to the neighbourhood of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.   The
Russells have had Covent Garden since <date value="1552">1552</date>, and are
therefore the oldest landowners in the county.   The
Cecils come next, with their estates in the Strand, and
after them  the Howards, who inherited Arundel House
and the surrounding land adjoining the Outer Temple
from the Arundels in <date value="1603">1603</date>. But these examples are
taken from families who remain in the male line. The
Newdegates trace a female descent from Roger de
Bacheworth in <date value="1284">1284</date>, whose estate at <placeName key="Harefield">Harefield</placeName> is still in
their possession.  Bordeston, or Boston   House has

belonged to the Clitherows for two centuries, and they
are therefore, outside the suburbs, the oldest of Middlesex
families.<note place="foot" n="5">Mr. Shirley found no family in Middlesex to fit the requirements of
admission to his list of 'Noble and Gentle Men of England,' all of whom
held land before Bosworth. See further on in this chapter.
</note></p>
<p>  The greatest overflow of the city population took place
into the hundred of <placeName key="Ossulston">Ossulston</placeName>. This hundred, the origin
of whose name, Oswulf's Town, has long been forgotten,
was very early divided into <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, <placeName key="Kensington">Finsbury</placeName>, <placeName key="Wenlakesbarn">Wenlakesbarn</placeName> or <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, and the Tower Hamlets, which
last comprises simply the old parish of <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName>.  Most
of the <soCalled>hamlets</soCalled>, such as Wapping, now St. George's-in-the-East, <placeName key="Limehouse">Limehouse</placeName>, <placeName key="Stratford-le-Bow">Stratford-le-Bow</placeName>, <placeName key="Hoxton">Hoxton</placeName>, and
<placeName key="Bethnal Green">Bethnal Green</placeName>, have become separated parishes. Few
remains of the green country have survived among them.
<placeName key="Finsbury">Finsbury</placeName> is not yet entirely built over. Finsbury-park
is a remnant of the ancient hunting-ground of the
bishop in Hornsey. Further west there is more open
country, and in <placeName key="Willesden">Willesden</placeName> and <placeName key="Acton">Acton</placeName>, <placeName key="Drayton">Drayton</placeName> and
<placeName key="Ealing">Ealing</placeName>, there are still thorny hedges and shady lanes in
abundance. But the division of Holborn is covered with
houses, except where such artificial breathing spaces as
the Regent's Park have been preserved. Many attempts
were made to restrict the growth of suburbs. Three
decrees at least were issued forbidding building in the
reign of queen Elizabeth; and her successors, down to
<persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Oliver Cromwell</persName>, made proclamations to the same effect
but without avail.</p>
 <p> The first exodus from the city was due to the desire
of the aristocracy to find sites for large houses. A survey
of the successive migrations of fashion would afford us a
complete history of the suburbs.  The Belgravias of
one age became in turn the St. Giles's of another. A hundred






<pb n="6" id="p.6"/>

years ago Soho began to decline; learned rather than
fashionable people occupied its decaying palaces. Less
than thirty years ago the nomads of good society moved
out to <placeName key="v">Pimlico</placeName>. Thirty years hence, what will <placeName key="Pimlico">Pimlico</placeName>
be like ? Yet there is nothing capricious in this constant
ebb and flow.  Four hundred years ago the Strand became fashionable, and it was only in our own day that
Northumberland House, the last of the long row of
river-side mansions, was removed. The change began with
Essex House and Arundel House, and went steadily on,
but Somerset House still represents an ancient nobleman's
residence.  The beautiful gateway at the foot of Buckingham Street, designed by <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName> and executed by
Nicholas Stone, still tells of the existence of York Place,
where <persName key="Bacon, Francis">Francis Bacon</persName> was born.   Within a very few
years two immense districts of new houses have sprung
up in Belgravia and Bayswater. Fifty years ago, or less,
the Five Fields extended from <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> to <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>,
and hardly a house was to be seen from <placeName key="Piccadilly">Millbank</placeName> to
<placeName key="Brompton">Brompton</placeName>. Portland Place and the terraces surrounding
the Regent's Park, with all the streets between Portman
Square and Langham Place, formed the refuge of the
movable fashion. A centre which may be placed, according to Sydney Smith, in Grosvenor Square, existed then
and exists still. A tract which was published anonymously in <date value="1826">1826</date> affords some curious information on the
alterations then going forward, and shows us how rapidly
the town, and many other things with it, have grown
since that time.<note place="foot" n="6">Short Remarks and Suggestions upon Improvements' (by lord
  Farnborough), published by Hatchards in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, <date value="1826">1826</date>.</note> The writer, for instance, remarks with
wonder upon the clumsy semaphore erected in <date value="1816">1816</date> on
the top of the Admiralty, upon <quote>the illuminating power of
smoke of coal,</quote> and upon the speedy conveyance between






          <pb n="7" id="p.7"/>

Dover and Calais <quote>by means of a kettle of boiling water.</quote>
But the interest of the tract lies in the opinions of the
writer on questions, long since solved, of projeted improvement, such as the removal of the Exchequer from
Palace Yard and of the stables which abutted on Whitehall Chapel. The <quote>ground lately occupied as the King's
Mews is to be converted into a large square,</quote> and he
suggests that in its centre should be placed an exact
imitation of the Parthenon. Of old Buckingham House,<note place="foot" n="7">Pine's <title>Royal Residences</title>, vol. ii.</note>
which has since been replaced by the overgrown lath
and plaster palace of our own day, he says, "when the
foreign princes visited this country in the year <date value="1814">1814</date>, one
of them, who had received from us very large sums of
money for the prosecution of the revolutionary war, reproached us very contemptuously with the meanness of
our royal palaces; it was observed in answer that 'our
magnificence was to be seen in our subsidies, not in our
palaces. "</p>
<p>This delightful old anecdote, of what would now be
called the real <soCalled>Jingo</soCalled> type, undoubtedly points to a
feature of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> scenery impossible to be overlooked.
There is no French or German town whose suburbs have
the mean appearance of the outskirts of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. Not
our palaces only, but all our streets have the same aspect
of genteel poverty, neat ugliness, so to speak, which
is caused in great part by the smallness of each particular tenement, the meanness of the materials, and a
thoroughly English dislike of show unaccompanied by
comfort, which, combined with the inclemency of the
climate, make each family anxious, if adornment is
thought of at all, to put it within, not without the house.</p>
  <p>Great palaces rapidly disappear before rows of small
villas; and the neighbourhood of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> undergoes, in







<pb n="8" id="p.8"/>

  regular stages, three transformations. The open country
  is first enclosed in great parks, like those of Gunnersbury, or Stanwell, or Cranford.  Next it is broken up
  into villas like those at Twickenham, or on the site of
  Belsize Park, or the sides of Highgate Hill. Lastly, it
  becomes streets and lanes, such as we have seen springing
  up in our own day at Kensington Gore, at Paddington,
  and in hundreds of other places.</p>
    <p>The park and palace stage in Middlesex was preceded
  by the ecclesiastical. A large proportion of the Middlesex
  manors belonged before the dissolution to the church.
  St. Paul's, with its bishop, its dean, and its canons,<note place="foot" n="8">For a list of the prebends of St. Paul's see Appendix F.
</note>
  owned Fulham, Hornsey, Hampstead, Willesden, St.
  Pancras, Bloomsbury, Holborn, Islington, and the great
  lordship, as it was called, of Stepney.  The abbot of
  Abingdon had Kensington; the abbot of Westminster,
  Paddington, Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, half of Chelsea,
  besides the great parish of St. Margaret's, which originally extended from near Kensington Church to Ludgate
  in one direction and from Kilburn to the Thames in
  another.  Tyburn belonged to Barking Abbey and
  Lylleston to Clerkenwell Priory.</p>
    <p>In outlying places the influence of the church was not
  so strong, even though the land belonged in general to
  religious houses, regular or secular.  Thus the archbishop had Harrow and the abbey of St. Albans,
  Stanmore, but there were no great monasteries among
  the lonely villages of the great Middlesex forest, and it
  made, no doubt, little difference to the farmer at Harefield whether his rent was paid to the prior of St. John
  or to Master Robert Tyrwhit.   The inhabitants of
  Feltham knew little of the hospital of St. Giles, except
  that it received the tithes of their corn. The Templars






                                   <pb n="9" id="p.9"/>

and Hospitallers were probably no better or worse as
landlords to Cranford than the Astons and the Berkeleys.
It was not until the new lords of the land went out to
live on their estates that the change was felt, and a fresh
era began for the London suburbs.</p>
  <p>In a very few cases the laity obtained property in
Middlesex before the dissolution of the monasteries.
The manor of Enfield, for instance, has descended from
Geoffrey Mandeville to its present owner without going
through the hands of any ecclesiastical proprietor.
Mandeville's heiress married another Geoffrey, the son of
Piers, and a prominent citizen of London.<note place="foot" n="9">See above, vol. i. p. 129.</note> Enfield went
to him and his descendants till Maud Fitz Piers, otherwise Mandeville, married one of the many Humphrey de
Bohuns who were successively earls of Hereford. This
was early in the thirteenth century, and Enfield continued to belong to the Bohuns till the end of the fourteenth, when it went, with other great estates, to Henry
of Bolingbroke, with his wife, Mary, the mother of
Henry V. It was then annexed by act of parliament
to the duchy of Lancaster, and now belongs to the
queen. Lysons<note place="foot" n="10">'Middlesex Parishes,' p. 107.</note> observes of the Newdegates of Harefield that their estate has descended by intermarriages,
with the exception of a temporary alienation, in regular
succession through the families of Bacheworth, Swanland,
and Newdegate since the year <date value="1284">1284</date>, when by the verdict
of a jury it appeared that Roger de Bacheworth and his
ancestors had held it from time immemorial. It is
curious to remark that this old family is not mentioned
in Domesday. The estate was held under a lord, and
was reckoned part of the honour of Clare, and so came,
like Enfield, to the duchy of Lancaster, and it was only
in <date value="1790">1790</date> that Sir Roger Newdegate obtained a release,







<pb n="10" id="p.10"/>

under the great seal of the duchy, from the payment of
an annual quit rent of 22s.<note place="foot" n="11"><foreign lang="LA">Hoc manerium tenuit Goda comitissa</foreign> T.R.E. 'Domesday Book.'
Lysons goes on to say that this is the only instance of such remote
possession in the county of Middlesex. In so speaking he may have overlooked Enfield.</note></p>
  <p>Geoffrey Mandeville had other estates in Middlesex,
and his manor of <placeName key="Edmonton">Edmonton</placeName> was held to include that of
<soCalled>Mimes,</soCalled> now called South Mimms, the further history
of which is a very typical example of the descent of a
manor in lay hands. When we look at a map of
Middlesex we observe that the boundary lines of the
county on three sides were fixed mainly by the course of
three rivers, the Coln, the Thames, and the Lea. But
the fourth, or northern boundary, is more irregular. The
line leaves the Coln at <placeName key="Harefield">Harefield</placeName>, and zigzags first in an
easterly direction, then north-west, and then turning east
again, reaches the valley of the Lea just below Waltham
Abbey. This double bend almost surrounds the <placeName key="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</placeName> parishes of Totteridge and two of the three
Barnets, but leaves South Mimms within the limits of
Middlesex.  The irregularity is very interesting.  It
points to a time when no exact boundary had been drawn
through the forest, and it shows how great was the influence of the church in shaping the modern county. It
seems probable that Hertfordshire was also inhabited by
the small Middle Saxon tribe; but it is impossible now
to fix with certainty the date at which the boundary was
made. Two things only we know. It must have been
after the foundation of St. Albans Abbey, and therefore
after the time of the great Offa of Mercia. And it was
also after the foundation of Ely. This is plain, because
the zigzag line is so drawn as to exclude High Barnet
and East Barnet, which belonged to St. Albans, and
Totteridge, which was an outlying part of the manor of

Hatfield, which king Edgar<note place="foot" n="12">The earliest mention of Hatfield in the ' Codex Diplomaticus' is in a
charter of queen AElfgifu, <date value="1012">1012</date>.</note> is said to have given to
Ely Abbey. This would bring the date to some time in
the tenth century, but would not exclude the possibility
of a much earlier date, as Hatfield may have belonged
to some Hertfordshire owner before it went to Ely. But
South Mimms<note place="foot" n="13">The meaning of the name escapes me. It may be personal. If so
who was Mim? North Mimms is called in Domesday <soCalled>Mimmine.</soCalled> The
surnames Minshew and Minshull-Mins-wood or hough-are not uncommon.</note> belonged to the owner of Edmonton,
and in the reign of Edward the Confessor this was no
other than that Esgar or Ansgar, the Staller, of whom
mention has been already made.<note place="foot" n="14">i. 74.</note>       William   gave the
whole manor to Geoffrey, and in after years his descendants made grants in South Mimms to the abbey he had
founded at Saffron Walden.  From one of the documents relating to these grants, which included the
advowson of the church, we find an indication pointing
to the time when the two Mimms had not been divided
by the boundary of two counties, for part of the endowment
of North Mimms, as late as the end of the thirteenth century, lay in the southern division. So far the
most northern district of Middlesex was but half cultivated, but half reclaimed from the ancient forest, though
the great highway ran from <placeName key="London">London</placeName> to <placeName key="St. Albans">St. Albans</placeName>
through it. <note place="foot" n="15"><quote>The ancient high waie to high Bernet,</quote> says Norden, as quoted by
Mr. Cass in his paper on South Mimms, published by the <placeName key="London">London</placeName> and

  and their gates, the oaks and the beeches, the open commons and chases and hunts. But as public security increased, the richer folk in the city found it pleasant to
  come out here now and then. Fine houses, more or less
  fortified, were built, and the wealthy merchant began to
  forget his merchandise, to marry into the noble and
  knightly families about him, and, gradually giving up all
  connection with the city, to become a wealthy country
  squire, perhaps a nobleman, himself.
  I have had, in my account of the city, frequent cause
  to speak of the Frowyks, or Frowykes, or Frowicks, who
  were so wealthy and powerful in the thirteenth century.
  One of them was warden during the memorable contest
about Walter Hervey's election to the mayoralty at the
time of the death of Henry III.<note place="foot" n="16">See above, vol. i. chapters v. and vi., and Aungier's 'French Chron.'
II. 13.</note> Another was reckoned
among the founders of the Guildhall Chapel. The ward
of Cheap was at one time called after Henry le Frowyk.
Half a century later the Frowyks are seated as squires
at Old Fold, within the parish of <placeName key="South Mimms">South Mimms</placeName>.<note place="foot" n="17">See pedigree and very full account, with a view of the Frowyke
Chantry in South Mimms Church, in Mr. Cass's paper already mentioned.
Their arms with twelve quarterings are there engraved.
</note> They
were not extinct in the male line in <date value="1505">1505</date>, when one of
them, Sir Thomas, left his estate in <placeName key="South Mimms">South Mimms</placeName> to his
daughter, Frideswide, who married Sir Thomas Cheyney,
K.G. He was chief justice of the Common Pleas, and
resided a little nearer town at Finchley. His cousin,
Henry Frowyke, whose daughter and heiress married
a Coningsby, was resident at Old Fold.   There are
descendants of the family among the highest nobility
now. Old Fold stood near Hadley Green, where the
moated site is still pointed out, now converted into a



                <pb n="13" id="p.13"/>

kitchen garden. The younger branches again and again
returned to seek and find fortunes in the city, and at
least one was distinguished as a lawyer. It was from his
monument, which has long disappeared from its place in
Finchley Church, that Norden copied the affecting little
epitaph-
          <quote rend="blockquote">Joan la feme de Thomas Frowicke gets icy
          <lb/><foreign lang="FR">Et le dit Thomas pense de giser avec luy</foreign>.</quote></p>
  <p>Another branch of the family was seated at Gunnersbury, a place which has a history of its own. Lysons
conjectures that the name is derived from that of Gunyld
or Gunnilda, niece of king Canute. If so, Gunnersbury
boasts of having belonged to two princesses, for Amelia,
the aunt of George III., bought it in <date value="1761">1761</date>, and lived here
till her death. The Frowykes were not long seated at
Gunnersbury, and the heiress of Sir Henry Frowyke, who
died in <date value="1505">1505</date>, carried it to the Spelmans, and it went
through various hands before it came to baron Lionel
Rothschild, its present owner, who has made the old
house, originally built, it is believed, by Webb, the pupil
of <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName>, <quote>one of the most sumptuous dwellings in
the vicinity of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</quote><note place="foot" n="18"> Thorne, ' Environs,' i. 160.</note> But, with the exception of the
park and house, all the old manor is gradually but surely
being covered with houses, and before long this hamlet
of Ealing will have shared the fate of the other suburbs,
and become a part of London.</p>
<p>Among the other great houses built during this stage
in the history of <placeName key="Middlesex">Middlesex</placeName>, Stanwell claims more than a
passing notice.  The manor had belonged to the
Windsors almost from the Conquest. In an evil hour for
lord Windsor, Henry VIII. took a fancy to it.  He had
entertained the king handsomely, and the king returned
his hospitality by coveting his house.  In vain lord




<pb n="14" id="p.14"/>

Windsor pleaded that it had been the seat of his
ancestors for many centuries: he begged the king not
to take it from him. He tremblingly hoped his highness
was not in earnest. Henry sternly referred him to the
attorney-general, who showed him the deed of exchange
already made out, and Bordesley Abbey, in Worcestershire, was substituted for the ancient inheritance of the
Windsors. The baron's Christmas fare was all laid in,
his furniture prepared, his hall warmed, before he left, for
he said before he left that the king should not at his
coming find it <soCalled>bare Stanwell.</soCalled></p>
<p>The strangest part of the story, perhaps, is that Henry
never does seem to have come to Stanwell. He probably, as Lysons suggests, only wanted to get rid of
some monastic property by exchange, and had lord
Windsor pointed out to him as a likely person on whom
to try the experiment. There was probably a disinclination to buy lands of which the church had been despoiled,
and we have all heard of the curse which for generations
was supposed to attach to owners of estates which had
belonged to religious fraternities. But the subsequent
history of Stanwell showed that lay property was just as
subject to vicissitudes under the Tudors and Stuarts.
In <date value="1603">1603</date> James I. gave it to Sir Thomas Knyvet, and
here the lady Mary, the king's daughter, died in <date value="1607">1607</date>.<note place="foot" n="19">See some remarks on the date of her death in Chester's 'Westminster
Abbey Registers' ; on her tomb and in the register it is <quote>December</quote> ; but
Col. Chester shows that it should be <quote>September.</quote> He is wrong, however, in speaking of her <quote>lying a corpse in the palace,</quote> during some
court festivities. She died in a private house, Stanwell.</note>
Knyvet made a curious will. He bequeathed Stanwell
to his grandnephew, John Cary, and his grandniece,
Elizabeth Leigh, and the family, to prevent the partition
of the estate, obtained a decree from the Court of







                                       <pb n="15" id="p.15"/>

Chancery, delaying it, that the cousins might marry and
unite their respective moieties. But Mistress Elizabeth
Leigh, when she came to an age to choose a husband,
chose, not John Cary, but Humphrey Tracy, who joined
in a family arrangement by which the division was again
postponed, and Stanwell became the property of Cary.
Undeterred by the failure of his grand uncle to prescribe
the marriages of his relatives, John Cary left Stanwell to
his own grandniece, Elizabeth Willoughby, on condition
that within three years after his death she should marry
lord Guildford.  In default it was to go to lord
Falkland. But Elizabeth Willoughby, like her cousin,
Elizabeth Leigh, had a mind of her own in such a matter
as her marriage, and refused either to marry lord
Guildford or to give up Stanwell. She preferred James
Bertie,<note place="foot" n="20">Second son of the first earl of Abingdon, and father of Willoughby
Bertie, third earl.</note> and the case went up to the House of Lords,
who decreed her a life interest in Stanwell. She lived
till <date value="1716">1716</date>, when the estate went to lord Falkland, but he
sold it within a few years, and it afterwards passed into
the possession of a great West Indian family, named
Gibbons, to whose representative it now belongs.  In
this case, therefore, we have within the space of a century
and a half no fewer than six different families successively in possession of a single estate. It is a curious
fact that every family owning land in the county since
the suppression of the monasteries, bought it or inherited
it by a female line.</p>
<p>  The Clitherows of <placeName key="Boston">Boston</placeName>, near <placeName key="Brentford">Brentford</placeName>, are usually
accounted the oldest of Middlesex families. <placeName key="Boston">Boston</placeName> was
originally called Bordeston, and belonged to the priory
of St. Helens. One of the last prioresses leased it to a
near relation.<note place="foot" n="21">See vol. i. chapter x.</note> But it came at last to the crown, and

  <pb id="p.16" n="16"/>


was among the estates of the protector Somerset at his
attainder.   It next belonged to Elizabeth's favourite,
Leicester, and was bought from     him  by the great Sir
Thomas Gresham.<note place="foot" n="22">Lysons, i. 29. It went to Gresham's stepson, Reade; thence to lady
Reade's second husband, Spencer; he left a widow who bought up the
reversions of the Reade heirs, and left Boston to her cousin Gouldsmith,
whose trustees sold it on his death. Here, therefore, are seven families
before <date value="1670">1670</date> : Seymour, Dudley, Gresham, Reade, Spencer, Gouldsmith and
Clitherow, besides the crown.</note>       Although it was not until <date value="1670">1670</date>
that James Clitherow bought it, yet Lysons remarked in
the last century that <quote>this family is to be mentioned as
one of the very few who have been resident upon the
same estate for more than a century.</quote>     Thorne, quoting
this sentence from Lysons, added: <quote> another century has
passed and Boston House is still the residence of a
Clitherow.</quote>   Two other families also, namely, the Woods
of Littleton and the Taylors of Staines have held their
respective estates for upwards of two centuries.<note place="foot" n="23">Richard Taylor bought Staines from Sir William Drake in <date value="1678">1678</date>.
Thomas Wood was owner of the advowson of Littleton in <date value="1673">1673</date>; but
neither Lysons nor Thorne succeeded in tracing the family further back.
The Woods bought the manor only a hundred years ago.

  <p>Perhaps the oldest inhabited house in England is in
Middlesex. Yet the seeker for ancient architecture will
be disappointed    at Fulham.      Like   so many other
ecclesiastical residences all over the country, it is at once
new and old. The law of dilapidations destroys equally
in a vicarage and an episcopal manor house the remains
and appearance of antiquity. There is a gate in the
garden which bears the arms of bishop Fitz James, who
was appointed to the see by Henry VII.        Very nearly
as ancient is Hampton Court.     The manor belonged at
the suppression to the knights of St. John, but had been
for some years in the hands of cardinal Wolsey, who had
obtained a lease from    the lord prior in   <date value="1515">1515</date>.   This



<pb n="17" id="p.17"/>

lease, which was for ninety-nine years at 50&#x00A3;. a year, and
a payment of 21&#x00A3;. to a chaplain, was all he had as security
when he commenced the sumptuous pile of which a
considerable part is still standing.<note place="foot" n="24">The accounts of Hampton Court in Lysons and Thorne are very full.
There is also a prettily illustrated little volume devoted to it by Jesse.</note></p>
  <p>Wolsey became a cardinal in the year he acquired
Hampton Court, and he speedily made the house worthy
of his exalted dignity. Stow mentions it as exciting
much envy "-envy shared by a personage who was not
to be baulked of anything he desired.  Wolsey was
accustomed to watch the movements of Henry's mind.
He was equal to the occasion, and when the king asked
him why he had built so costly a house, unlike lord
Windsor at Stanwell, he promptly replied, <quote>To show
how noble a palace a subject may offer to his sovereign.</quote>
It is possible that as he had by this time enjoyed it for
eleven years he was tired of it.  He certainly knew the
king too well to be able to fancy he would refuse the
gift.  Henry showed no mock modesty or hesitation
in accepting it; he assigned to the cardinal instead a
right to use the not very distant Richmond when he
pleased. Henry was at Hampton when he heard of the
fate of his discarded minister, and here queen Anne
Boleyn presided <quote>at superb banquetings, with masques,
interludes, and sports.</quote>  Here Surrey fell in love with
the fair Geraldine:-
         <quote rend="blockquote">Hampton me taught to wish her first for mine.</quote>

Henry employed much of his time in field sports in the
neighbouring parks; and as he grew old he augmented
the estate by one of the most monstrous appropriations
attempted by any English sovereign since the days of
William the Norman. An Act was passed in <date value="1538">1538</date>




<pb n="18" id="p.18"/>

creating an <soCalled>Honour of Hampton,</soCalled> to include in one
royal hunting-ground not merely the adjacent Middlesex
manors but also nine manors on the Surrey side of the
Thames. The whole territory, of which Nonsuch was
the southern lodge, was surrounded by a wooden paling
and stocked with deer, churches and houses were pulled
down, villages depopulated, farms given up to wood,
meadows and pastures covered with game.  An order
passed the Privy Council in the next reign by which an
apology was tendered to outraged public opinion, and
the Honour <soCalled>dechased.</soCalled> <quote>His Highness,</quote> it was said,
<quote>waxed heavy with sickness, age, and corpulence of
body, and might not travel so readily abroad, but was
constrained to seek to have his game and pleasure ready
and at hand.</quote>  It is curious to remark that, in spite of
anything done under Edward VI. to mitigate the severity
of the Act, it has never been formally repealed, and the
Honour of Hampton is still a Royal Chase, controlled
by a steward, the lieutenant and keeper of Hampton
Court.</p>
  <p>The palace continued for two centuries a favourite
residence of our sovereigns.  It was the birth-place of
Edward VI., and here Jane Seymour, his mother, died.
Here three Katharines<note place="foot" n="25">Katharine Howard <soCalled>haunts</soCalled> the passage to the chapel. Law,

other as Henry's wives.  Here the council was held in
Elizabeth's reign which adjudged death to Mary Stuart;
and here, under her son, the abortive conference of
presbyterians and bishops took place. Charles I. passed
some time at Hampton under the restraints imposed
by the rebellious parliament, and made the attempt to
escape which eventually led to his stricter imprisonment at Carisbrooke. On a dark tempestuous evening in

November, <date value="1647">1647</date>, pretending to be indisposed, he retired
early to his chamber, and passing through some vaulted
passages reached the gardens, accompanied by three
courtiers all in disguise. A private door admitted them
to the Thames bank, and a boat which was in readiness
conveyed them to the Surrey side. The ill-fated princess
Elizabeth was at Hampton Court at the time, and it was
in consequence of her complaining that the sentries disturbed her rest that they were removed to a greater
distance, and thus greater facility afforded for the
king's flight.<note place="foot" n="26">Jesse's 'Court of England,' ii. 49.</note> A little later Cromwell lived much at

the gardens, and sauntered in the " parterre which they
call Paradise, in which is a pretty banquetting house set

  <p>William III. employed Wren to replace two of Wolsey's
courts by a new building, which, although wholly incongruous, is a fine example of his palatial style.  The
staircases were especially grand.  The gardens, newly
laid out in a Dutch style, with vistas across the river, are
still much as William left them, with a terrace half a mile
in length and canal-like ponds.  Queen Anne resided









<pb n="20" id="p.20"/>

long at Hampton ; and here, in her reign, Pope laid the
scene of his 'Rape of the Lock.' For many years past
it has boasted of no royal inhabitant.  George III. is
said to have disliked it.<note place="foot" n="29">See Law's ' Pictures at Hampton Court,' p. 102.</note> Queen Victoria has made it a
scene of happiness to many of her subjects, for not only are
the state rooms with their noble pictures and the gardens
open to the public, but the more private apartments
are appropriated to the use of those whom the nation
looks on as most deserving of a public recognition.
Thus it came to pass that in his old age Michael Faraday
was able, in the intervals of toil, to exchange the turmoil
of a <placeName key="London">London</placeName> street for these pleasant shades, and here,
in <date value="1867">1867</date>, he breathed his last.</p>
  <p>When Charles I. came to Hampton his children were
not far off at Syon, in the charge of the earl of Northumberland.  Syon had been an abbey of the order of St.
Bridget,<note place="foot" n="30">Aungier's 'History of Syon and Isleworth.'</note> founded by Henry V., who separated the
manor of Isleworth, within which the new house was
situated, from the estates of the duchy of Cornwall, and
conferred it upon the abbess. The name was a reference
to the holy mount, and the number of inmates
answered to the thirteen apostles, including St. Paul,
and the seventy-two disciples.  There were thirteen
priests attached, and in the original statutes of St.
Bridget all were to live together, but at Syon the
sexes were cautiously and carefully separated, <quote>for the
avoiding of scandal.</quote> The abbess was ruler over both,
and no sister was admitted under the age of eighteen, no
brother under twenty-five. The manor of Isleworth included the whole hundred of that name, and the foundation, as time went on, became exceedingly wealthy. In
the reign of Henry VIII. fifty-six nuns were in the house,


<pb n="21" id="p.21"/>

and as some of them were said to have been implicated
with the supporters of the Maid of Kent,<note place="foot" n="31">See vol. i. chapter x.</note> this was one
of the first religious houses suppressed.  Charges of immodest behaviour were freely made against the priests
and nuns by the visitors under <persName key="Cromwell, Thomas">Thomas Cromwell</persName>, and
in <date value="1539">1539</date> the abbey was surrendered into the king's hands,
when the clear income was found to be no less than
<date value="1731">1731</date>&#x00A3;. 8s. 4 and three fourthd. Pensions were granted to fifty-six sisters
and to eighteen brethren. The nuns, however, so far
proved the sincerity of their profession that they continued to live together elsewhere until queen Mary
reinstated them at Syon, which had been kept in the
possession of the crown.  At their final suppression in
the following reign they migrated in a body to Portugal,
carrying with them the abbey keys, as the Arabs of
Spain are said to have taken with them to Morocco the
keys of their ancient dwellings on the slopes of the
Sierras. When, centuries later, a duke of Northumberland was at Lisbon he visited the Bridgettine convent,
and the abbess told him that they still retained the keys
brought from Syon by their predecessors. <quote>I dare say,</quote>
replied the duke; <quote>but we have altered the locks since
then.</quote> During the French invasion of Portugal the nuns
sought a refuge in England, and lived some time at
Peckham. When the war was over the Lisbon house
was revived, and in <date value="1861">1861</date> the community returned a
second time to England, and took up their abode in
<placeName key="Dorsetshire">Dorsetshire</placeName>.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Syon underwent various vicissitudes. It
was, with the neighbouring Osterley, a part of the estate
of Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset.      On his
attainder both reverted to the Crown, and Syon was
granted to the duke's rival, Northumberland,  Here

<pb n="22" id="p.22"/>

the ill-fated lady Jane Dudley received the offer of
the throne. At the duke's attainder, for the second or
third time Syon went to the Crown; it so remained
during the reign of Elizabeth. James I. gave it to
Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, in <date value="1604">1604</date>, and
when, in <date value="1682">1682</date>, the heiress of the Percies married the
<soCalled>proud duke of Somerset,</soCalled> it became a second time the
property of a Seymour. Within sixty years, however, it
went to a third family, that of Smithson, whose representative, the duke of Northumberland, is its present owner.
Though the modern house is mainly that built by the
protector Somerset, it has been so often altered and remodelled that nothing is visible of the older building.
A century ago, both Syon and Osterley underwent the
finishing touches of the accomplished Robert Adam, on
whose work <persName key="Walpole, Horace">Horace Walpole</persName> dilates with rapture. In
our own day the famous lion from Northumberland
House at <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> migrated thither, and now looks
down on the terraced lawns, with their vistas towards
<placeName key="Kew Gardens">Kew Gardens</placeName>, which appear almost as if they formed part
of the domain. The interior of the house is famous for
its magnificence and for the costly collections it contains.
Columns of <hi rend="italics">verde antique</hi>, found in the Tiber, and purchased at an enormous price, mosaic tables, a vase of
Irish crystal mounted in gold, portraits by Holbein and
Reynolds, pictures by Snyders and Landseer, prints,
drawings, and books, make it worthy of its owner's rank
and wealth.</p>
  <p>Few such houses as Syon now remain in Middlesex,
but Osterley in some respects runs it close. Both were
remodelled by Adam.   The older Osterley was the
scene of a well-known story. It belonged in the time
of Elizabeth to Sir Thomas Gresham. <quote>Her majesty,</quote>
says Fuller-himself at a later period rector of Cranford,



                              <pb n="23" id="p.23"/>

not far off- <quote>Her majesty found fault with the court of
this house as too great, affirming that it would appear more
handsome if divided with a wall in the middle. What
doth Sir Thomas, but in the night time sends for workmen
to London (money commands all things), who so speedily
and silently apply their business that the next morning
discovered that court double which the night had left
single before.</quote> Fuller adds the opinion of some, with
special reference to disputes in the Gresham family, that
any house is easier divided than united, and certainly
Sir Thomas's was no exception.  Osterley went, like
Bordeston, of which I have already spoken, to lady
Gresham's son by her first marriage, afterwards to Sir
Edward Coke, then to a descendant of lady Gresham,
the wife of George earl of Desmond, and finally, after
several intermediate owners, to Francis Child, the
banker.<note place="foot" n="32">See vol. i. chapter xiii.</note> With the rest of his wealth it ultimately
descended to the Jersey family.</p>
  <p>Another great Middlesex house has long disappeared.
The glory of Canons was of brief duration,<note place="foot" n="33">Thorne, i. 72.</note> but a blacksmith's shop, hard by at Edgware, is associated still with
the name of <persName key="Handel, George Frederick">George Frederick Handel</persName>, who was organist
to the duke of Chandos. He had been previously in the

still to describe.  At <placeName key="Whitchurch">Whitchurch</placeName> there are tangible
memorials of the great musician. Tradition and something more has commemorated William Powell, the harmonious blacksmith. He was parish clerk of Whitchurch,
and died in <date value="1780">1780</date>. The humble rail which marked his
grave has lately given place to a substantial monument,
which bears among the inscriptions a bar of Handel's



<pb n="24" id="p.24"/>

immortal air.<note place="foot" n="34">It is said to have been traced to an old German melody, but Handel
made it his own.</note>  Authentic history, and what is often
more valuable, contemporary satire, are frequently concerned with Handel and Canons and the village church
in which his organ may still be heard. Pope sneered at
the duke and the musician alike, and prophesied but too
exactly the rapid approach of a time when <quote>deep harvests</quote> should <quote>bury all his pride had planned, and
laughing Ceres reassume the land.</quote>  Three years after
Pope's death his forebodings were fulfilled. The duke
was ruined by the South Sea Bubble,<note place="foot" n="35">Vol. i. chapter xiii.</note> and the house was
sold for the materials in <date value="1747">1747</date>. The grand staircase went
to Chesterfield House in <placeName key="Mayfair">Mayfair</placeName>, where it still remains.
A statue of king George<note place="foot" n="36">There is some uncertainty which  <soCalled>king George</soCalled> was represented.</note> went to Leicester Square, and
disappeared piecemeal in our own day. A new, but
smaller and more economical house, was afterwards
inhabited by colonel O'Kelly, who owned, besides a
famous parrot, a racehorse which from its birth during
an eclipse, made the word celebrated as the name of the
swiftest horse that ever ran. Eclipse lies buried in the
park of Canons. His master is buried in the church of
Little Stanmore, or Whitchurch, in which there is still
much to remind the visitor of Handel and his magnificent
patron the duke.</p>
  <p>Without, the church is severely classical. It belies its
name by being of red brick. Within, it is not only
stately and convenient, but of an unusual design, a
design, indeed, which an unprejudiced critic might be
tempted to consider more suited to the requirements of
modern worship than any adaptation of mediaeval
gothic. It consists of a nave without aisles, and a small







     <pb n="25" id="p.25"/>

chancel raised on three steps with richly carved oak
columns to mark the separation. At the other end is a
gallery, and behind the altar is the organ, Handel's
organ.  The most curious feature of Little Stanmore
church is the decoration. As Pope scornfully and not
quite accurately observes,-

        <quote rend="blockquote">On painted ceilings you devoutly stare,
          <lb/>Where sprawl the saints of Verrio and Laguerre,
          <lb/>Or gilded clouds in fair expansion lie,
          <lb/>And bring all Paradise before your eye.</quote>

Verrio had been dead for some years, but Bellucci's name
would not fit into the line. There are figures of the evangelists and the apostles, of the cardinal virtues, and the law
and gospel. The roof is blue, powdered with gold stars.
On the north side is the chapel of the Chandos family,
where the unfortunate duke, in Roman armour and a
flowing wig, is supported by two of his wives-for he had
three-on a magnificent tomb, recently repaired by the
duke of Buckingham and Chandos, the heir of what was
left of the family wealth.</p>
  <p>The villa of another duke in Middlesex has a longer
history than Canons. I have had occasion more than
once to mention the <soCalled>architect earl</soCalled> of Burlington.<note place="foot" n="37">Vol. i. chapter xii., and vol. ii. chapter xxi.
</note>
The masterpiece of his art was a villa at <placeName key="Chiswick">Chiswick</placeName>,
which now belongs to his descendant, the duke of
Devonshire.</p>
  <p>Chiswick is not mentioned in Domesday, but it is
probable that a manor in Fulham, said to belong to the
canons of St. Paul's, may be identified with it. It was
early divided, and the duke of Devonshire has the lease
of that part which used to be called Sutton. The other
still nominally belongs to St. Paul's, but in <date value="1570">1570</date> it happened








<pb n="26" id="p.26"/>

that the stall of Chiswick was filled by Gabriel
Goodman, who was dean of Westminster, and he leased
it to the chapter of the abbey, who still, I believe, hold
it, though the prebendary receives, or should receive, a
small rent.<note place="foot" n="38">In <date value="1845">1845</date>, it was reported worth annually 39&#x00A3; 2s. 6d. See Falkner,
'Brentford, Ealing and Chiswick,' a book on which too much dependence
must not be placed.</note></p>
<p>Chiswick House was for some time the residence of
Carr earl of Somerset, the disgraced favourite of James I.
He mortgaged it heavily to provide a dowry for his
daughter, who married the earl of Bedford, and so
became mother of William, lord Russell, beheaded in
<date value="1683">1683</date>. The house became the property of the mortgagee,
and after various changes it was bought by Richard
Boyle, earl of Burlington and Cork. His great grandson
was the architect, and lies buried in Chiswick Church
beside his friend and assistant, Kent. He pulled down
the old house and built the new one, which, with the
addition of wings, still stands. His heiress married the
fourth  duke   of Devonshire.    Lord   Burlington  was
brought up in a beautiful old house on Campden Hill,<note place="foot" n="39">See below, chapter xxi.</note>
which may have stimulated his very remarkable architectural ability.  He alone of modern classical builders
seems to me to be worthy of comparison with Wren.<note place="foot" n="40">See above, vol. i. chapter xii.</note>
His dormitory at Westminster School is perhaps the
only one of his works which has survived intact.<note place="foot" n="41">One fears to call attention to the existence of anything worth admiring or preserving in the scholastic precincts. The design is believed to have
been founded on a drawing by <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName>.</note>Burlington House, in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, has been defaced, and
Chiswick has been added to, but enough remains to show

<pb n="27" id="p.27"/>

 imitated with some directness from one by Palladio.
 The wits of the time made merry over it.  Various jests
 have been reported, and misreported, to the effect that,
 while it was too small to live in, it was too large to be
 hung on a watch chain.<note place="foot" n="42">This epigram, which may be found in Walpole's 'Anecdotes of Painting,' is attributed, with others, to lord Hervey. By Lysons it is assigned

   <p>By a curious coincidence, two very eminent statesmen
 died in the villa, though they were not owners or even
 tenants. Charles James Fox <note place="foot" n="43">These notes are quoted by Faulkner from lady Chatterton's ' Home
Sketches and Foreign Recollections,' published in <date value="1841">1841</date>. In lord Stanhope's 'Miscellanies,' Second Series, p. 79, the question whether the two
statesmen died in the same room, as commonly reported, and asserted by
Thorne, i. 110, is set at rest by a letter from the late duke of Devonshire.</note> went to stay there for
 change of air in <date value="1806">1806</date>, and died in a fortnight. Twenty-
 one years later George Canning came there with his wife
 for the same reason, and after three weeks also died.
 Fox's bed-chamber was on the ground floor, <quote>a small
 but cheerful room,</quote> the walls covered with tapestry, and
 a portrait of Pope over the door.    The bed had chintz
 curtains, with <quote>a large and flowery pattern of green and
 red, upon a light ground.</quote> The wooden cornice was
 painted a light brown and green, and the fringe, tassels,
 and lining were also green.   During the garden-parties
 for which in the last generation Chiswick was so
 famous, and at one of which Sir <persName key="Scott, Walter">Walter Scott</persName> and an
 elephant assisted, this chamber was used as a refreshment-room. The room in which Canning died is up stairs.  Lord Dalling gave an account of it many years
 ago in a magazine, in which he characterised it as " cheerless."  When his essays<note place="foot" n="44">'Historical Characters,' ii. 402.</note> were reprinted he altered the
 word to <quote>simple.</quote> Near it was another into which Mrs.
 Canning was carried after all was over. Her life was at



<pb n="28" id="p.28"/>

first despaired of, but she recovered, and, having been
created a viscountess, she survived her husband nearly
ten  years.<note place="foot" n="45">The duke's note is as follows:- <quote>Chiswick, March 18, <date value="1854">1854</date>. My
dear Lady Newburgh, Canning died in a room upstairs. I had a great
foreboding when he came here, and would not allow of his living in the
room below, where Fox had died. The other room above has been very
much altered, and furnished differently since. I am not surprised at Lord
Mahon wanting to know; it was a sad and curious coincidence. Ever
yours, &amp;c., Devonshire.</quote>  Lady Chatterton says:- <quote>The housekeeper

India.</p>
  <p>The grounds were beautifully laid out by Kent.  As
an example of successful landscape gardening they are
unrivalled.  Sir Joseph Paxton was <soCalled>discovered</soCalled> by
the late duke in the adjoining grounds of the Royal
Horticultural Society, and soon, with such a patron,
found means to distinguish himself, but the results of his
labours are chiefly to be seen at Chatsworth. <note place="foot" n="46">It is said, on the authority of local gossip, that the sums spent by
Paxton at Chatsworth would have ruined the duke had not lady Paxton
developed financial powers of a remarkable character.</note> Some of
the statues are from the old Arundel collection, others
are skilful modern imitations of the antique.    One relic
of peculiar interest will be eagerly sought out by the

formerly the Lovers' Lane. The house was pulled down
by Sir <persName key="Sloane, Hans">Hans Sloane</persName> a few years after he bought it, in

temptations to prolixity. I have endeavoured to take a

in the county without its memories of some one who
made himself famous in the great neighbouring city.
Sometimes the same eminent person is found in different

have said nothing of <placeName key="Strawberry Hill">Strawberry Hill</placeName> and <persName key="Walpole, Horace">Horace Walpole</persName>, partly because so much has been written already
on the subject, and partly because I do not concern myself with mere records of fashion. For similar reasons I
have omitted many other places.  A connected history
of the immediate suburbs is more to my purpose, and it
must suffice here merely to recall a few of the great
names which otherwise I pass over. We might stand
with <persName key="Keats, John">Keats</persName> where he composed his 'Ode to a Nightingale,' though the view from <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName> is so changed,
especially in the last few years, that little remains to be
seen as he saw it. From " Byron's Tomb," as a nameless
stone is called in the churchyard of Harrow, we can still
look over as fair a vale as any either poet ever saw.  It
is interesting to visit the room in which queen Anne was
born at York House, <placeName key="Twickenham">Twickenham</placeName>.  At <placeName key="Wrotham">Wrotham</placeName>, near
Barnet, we may see a house built by the ill-fated admiral

in Kent. We may trace the footsteps of Monk from his

Parson's Green the residence of <persName key="Richardson, Samuel">Samuel Richardson</persName>.
And we must beware of spurious imitations.  John
Gilpin's "Bell at Edmonton" has disappeared, and
another Bell since. The house at <placeName key="Highgate">Highgate</placeName> in which

milestone has been moved about to different places, if,
indeed, any of it remains.  Pope's villa was built in the
present century, and is not even on the original site.
But more than enough remains.   There is <placeName key="Bedfont">Bedfont</placeName>,
where Harvey discovered the immortal fish sauce. There
is Laleham, where Arnold <soCalled>coached</soCalled> young collegians
and prepared himself for the great work of his life. At

<p>IT is not easy to define exactly what is <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> at
the present day. There is the city, there is the parliamentary borough, there is the outlying division near
Kensington-in short, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> has undergone many
vicissitudes and changes, and has been influenced in turn
by kings, by monks, by bishops, by parliaments, by
courts of law, until we are compelled, if we would find
the original <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, to commence our inquiries by
going back more than a thousand years.</p>
<p>  The name itself seems to tell us something. If we
could be sure that it has always been <soCalled>the West Minster,</soCalled>"
we might argue that the western monastery is later than
St. Paul's, that St. Paul's was in existence as the eastern
minster when St. Peter's was founded. But the first
charter in which it is mentioned gives it three different
names.   Offa, of Mercia, in 785,<note place="foot" n="1">This charter (Kemble, i. No. 149) is marked with a star, and is not,
therefore, existing except in a copy which may not be genuine. At the
same time there is nothing in it inconsistent with the fidelity of the copy,
and Widmore (' Enquiry,' p. 7) accepts it.</note> making it a grant of
land, calls it, first, St. Peter's; secondly, Thomey;
thirdly, "Westminster."   We cannot, therefore, found
any argument or theory on this last form. St. Peter's
speaks for itself. It is likely, on the whole, as we have
seen in considering the dedications of city churches, that
dedications to the apostles are older than dedications to

<pb n="33" id="p.33"/>

other saints. St. Peter's is an old dedication; in fact, it is
difficult to understand how the cathedral church of St.
Paul can have preceded it. This difficulty, no doubt,
appeared insuperable to the medieval mind, and we have
the legend of the superior antiquity of St. Peter's upon
Cornhill, to account for it. It is evident, therefore, that
while we cannot claim for St. Peter's an antiquity
greater than that of St. Paul's, we must allow that it
may be very old, as old as any other foundation of the
kind.</p>
  <p>The second name is <placeName key="Thorney">Thorney</placeName>, and Thorney is spoken
of as a "locus terribilis," a venerable place.<note place="foot" n="2">This interpretation has been suggested by Mr. Henry Middleton,F.S.A.,
and commends itself to our common sense. The reader will recall the
expression of Jacob (Genesis, xxviii. 17) "How dreadful is this place!
This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
<foreign lang="LA">Quam terribilis est locus iste</foreign>, are the words of the Vulgate. In a poem on
the life of Edward the Confessor, published in the Rolls Series, there is a
similar reference to Jacob's dream. "King Edward calls this holy place
the gate of heaven."-P. 198.</note>   It must,
therefore, have been considered sacred, perhaps by long
custom, perhaps on account of association with some
eminent person.   A  king Sebert<note place="foot" n="3">There was a king called Sebert or Seberht, as already mentioned
(chap. iii.), but his connection with Westminster was not thought of till
after the Conquest, when the place had become important.</note> was invented later to
account for this veneration.   Widmore is very unwilling
to put Sebert aside, but is obliged to conclude that the
monastery was founded <quote>about the time when Bede died,
or between the years <date value="730">730</date> and <date value="740">740</date>;</quote> and he goes on to
show that at first it was but a small place, and evidently
altogether unconscious of its high destinies.</p>
  <p>Although the name of Thorney tells us nothing about
the abbey, it tells us much about its site. The word
" terribilis" in Offa's charter has indeed sometimes been
supposed to refer to the nature of the place, a thorny

island.<note place="foot" n="4">See Stanley, 'Memorials,' p. 9.</note> We must remember that in the eighth century
the greater part of what is now <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> was a
tidal estuary, a marsh, or mud-flat, covered twice a day
with the brackish water of the Thames. In the midst of
this wilderness of mud rose a slight eminence, <soCalled>the Tothill,</soCalled> upon which the old road, the Watling Street, ran to
the water's edge. Thence travellers who wanted to cross
the Thames had to wade as best they could-the first
stepping-stone, so to speak, across the shallow river being
the Thorney. Here, so far back as the time of the
Romans, there stood some building, perhaps a post-house
for the convenience of passengers, perhaps a villa. A
portion of its pavement was recently discovered in the
nave of the church. It is not unlikely that a causeway of
some kind at a very early period connected Thorney and
Tothill. When, by degrees, the river was banked out,
and its channel narrowed and deepened, the ford gave
place to a ferry, which is commemorated still in the name
of Horseferry Road.  The abbey which originally stood
close by the water's edge was gradually separated from it
by a narrow belt of land, foreshore at first, but afterwards
wholly reclaimed, and now, as we shall see, the site of the
palace of parliament. The marshes to the north were
drained by what became in process of time the ornamental water in St. James's Park, and half the divided
stream of Tyburn passed through it, and by a narrowed
channel, south of the site of the future <placeName key="Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>, into the
Thames. On the southern side of the Thorn-ey, too, the
low lying lands were slowly reclaimed, part of the Tyburn
being conducted into and through the abbey itself, and
part being applied to grind the abbot's corn before it ran
out at <placeName key="Whitehall">Millbank</placeName>, where there was a second mill and a
slaughterhouse, belonging to the king's palace.

<p>   Thorney, according to a well qualified authority,<note place="foot" n="5"> William Bardwell, 'Westminster Improvements,' p. 8, and Smith's
' Westminster,' p. 27.</note> was
470 yards long and 370 broad, and was washed by the
Thames on the east; by a rivulet which ran down College
Street on the south; by a streamlet which crossed King
Street on the north; and by a moat called the Long
Ditch, which united the two streams and ran along the
line of Prince's and Delahay Streets. Stone walls defended the whole precinct, pierced by handsome gates,
one of which was in King Street, one near New Palace
Yard, one opening on Tothill Street,<note place="foot" n="6">Built in the reign of Edward III., by Walter Warfield, the Abbot's
butler.-Bardwell, p. 11.</note>  and one in College
Street where stood the abbey mill. Bridges crossed the
brooks, and are said to exist still, but far beneath the
present streets, for Thorney has been raised about nine
feet, on the average, above its ancient level.</p>
<p>  How early our kings had a palace here we have no
means of knowing. It may have preceded the monastery,
as St. Margaret's may have preceded St. Peter's, but
neither supposition is probable. The earliest reference
to a palace is in the story of Canute's rebuking the tide,
which some of the chroniclers have made to take place
at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.<note place="foot" n="7">Southampton is usually the scene of this legend. See Stanley,
'Memorials,' p. 7.</note> There is no contemporary evidence to
go upon; and whatever of palace or monastery existed
before the middle of the ninth century, disappeared later,
and for many years <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> lay in ruins, deserted
even by the monks. The Danes were at large in Middlesex, and London Wall<note place="foot" n="8">See above, chap. iii.</note> kept them out, but there was
nothing to withstand them on Thorney, and when Dunstan
became powerful under Edgar, the abbey was re-founded


<pb n="36" id="p.36"/>

and endowed with an estate, part of which is still in the
possession of the monks' successors, the dean and chapter. The charter of Edgar contains at account of the
boundaries of the great manor with which he endowed
the abbey.    They are the boundaries of the original
parish of St. Margaret, and are of the highest interest to

antiquity before the Conquest, and in every way valuable.

  <p>I have given the Saxon names in their original spelling.
It is a question if we can identify the places mentioned.
If we take a map which shows the undivided parish of
St. Margaret, we find it bounded on the west and southwest by <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>; on the north by Oxford Street, as far as
St. Giles's; on the east by St. Clement Danes. But from
the evidence of this charter, there was apparently a time
when all these boundaries were different.  The Merfleet
must, from its name, have been a tidal creek. Pollenstock
speaks of an osier bed, or something like it. Bulunga Fen is
a marshy place. All these conditions were fulfilled in the
land which lies between Millbank and <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, though the
old names are lost. From the reference to the Tyburn,





<pb n="37" id="p.37"/>

which we can here safely identify with the so-called King's
Scholars' Pond Sewer, we may begin by placing the
Merfleet at its outfall just east of Albion Terrace, on the
Grosvenor Road. The word <soCalled>fleet</soCalled> points to a tidal
estuary. The mention of Pollenstock and Cowford points
to places at which the boundary does not run quite
straight. We shall not be far wrong therefore, if we place
the pollard willow very near the Victoria Station. The
second bend would be that marked by the mention of
Bulunga Fen, which may be placed at Buckingham
Palace in the Green Park.  The Tyburn next crosses
what must be a very ancient roadway, now represented
by <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>.  Here, then, is the Cowford, as nearly as
possible where Brick Street, formerly Engine Street,<note place="foot" n="10"> See above, chap. i.</note>
opens on <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>. Thence to Oxford Street the brook
winds, and the boundary is defined as being along it; and
so we reach the wide herestreet,<note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">Here</hi>, an army, expedition, host, legion, multitude, troop, chiefly of
enemies, any number of men above thirty-five.-Bosworth's Dictionary.</note> the military way which
the Romans had made to bring the Watling Street into
connection with London Bridge.   Along this road it
continued to <soCalled>the old stock</soCalled> of St. Andrew's Church,
perhaps an ancient tree in what is now Holborn. Thence
it ran to the Fleet, here called <soCalled>Lundene Fen,</soCalled> and <soCalled>south
on Thames in mid-stream.</soCalled> The abbot, by this expression, <quote>on midstream,</quote> no doubt intended to guard himself
against any future royal claim to foreshore, but, as we
shall see, the precaution was eminently unsuccessful.</p>
<p>  It will have been observed that with these boundaries
the abbot had a larger tract eastward, and a smaller one
westward than afterwards constituted the parish of St.
Margaret. A great part of the city ward of Farringdon
Without belonged to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. There is no mention



<pb n="38" id="p.38"/>

of St. Bride's or St. Dunstan's and we may safely conclude that they did not exist. St. Bride's would, almost
certainly, have been mentioned like St. Andrew's. St.
Dunstan was himself alive in <date value="971">971</date>. When these two
churches were built and long afterwards we find the
abbey of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> presenting to them. Henry III.
appropriated St. Dunstan's to his hospital for converted
Jews,<note place="foot" n="12">Now the Rolls.</note> but St. Bride's is still in the gift of the dean and
chapter.</p>
<p>  The other end of the parish was extended. We saw<note place="foot" n="13">Chapter i.</note>
that a second stream ran into the Thames to the westward of the Tyburn, the brook which is commemorated
in the modern district of Westbourne. Shortly after the
conquest Geoffrey de Mandeville gave the abbot of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> the land which lay between the Tyburn and
the Westbourne, that is to say, all Hyde Park as far as
the modern Serpentine and all the Thames bank between
the modern King's Scholars' Pond Sewer, and the Ranelagh Sewer: and the northern and southern parts of this
great accession of territory were divided into Ebury, or.
Eybury and Hyde, both names being very likely derived
from the same word Ey, or <hi rend=
"italics">Eia</hi> by which the manor is
distinguished in Domesday. Furthermore the abbot
acquired three other estates. Of <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName> and <placeName key="Westbourne">Westbourne</placeName> I shall speak in a subsequent chapter: but the
manor of Neat, or Neyt, brought the boundary of St.
Margaret's up to that of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>. This manor comprised all the land south and west of the Serpentine, most
of Kensington Gardens, and the south side of the Kensington Road into High Street. Its boundaries are interesting. If we begin in the Uxbridge or Bayswater Road,
we find the line runs down the ornamental water halfway to the bridge, thence passes westward through the


 <pb n="39" id="p.39"/>

trees till it almost reaches the Orangery. There it slopes
northward and taking in all but the first five houses of
Kensington Palace Gardens, runs south in a straight line
to High Street, and including all the houses on the left
hand of the way as we go towards <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, crosses the
road just after we pass what used to be called Gore Lane,
but is now Queen's Gate or Prince Albert Road. Kensington Gore, the Albert Hall and the Horticultural Gardens are in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, but the line runs so as to exclude
the new Natural History and the South Kensington
Museums, which are in Kensington, or rather in the Kensington hamlet of Brompton. Thence the boundary runs
eastward, gradually approaching the main road, which is
touched, just as we have passed the new Knightsbridge
Barracks, where <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> and <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>
meet at the point at which the Westbourne used to cross
the road. An old inn, the Fox &#x0026; Bull, formerly stood
by the bridge, and is mentioned as early as the reign of
queen Elizabeth. The French Embassy in Albert Gate
is on the site, and the brook runs under the roadway.
A modern Fox &#x0026; Bull close by is now in process of
demolition.</p>
<p>  The notice of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> in the Domesday Book is
apparently very precise, yet from the difficulty involved
in all attempts to estimate exactly the modern value of
a hide of land, it has caused much controversy among
those learned in such matters. The hide in <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName>, a
holding fairly well defined, contained seventy-nine acres.
But in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> which comprised sixteen hides and a
half, it must, if our geography is right, have been only
seventyhides. The discrepancy maybe partially resolved
by remembering that in <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName> there was more land
than in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> occasionally, if not constantly submerged. Of the sixteen hides and a half which constituted



<pb n="40" id="p.40"/>

the manor of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, three were held by a tenant
named Bainiard,or Baynard. It has usually been assumed
that Baynard is the baron who built Castle Baynard in
the city, and it has been conjectured that his three hides
of land comprised the rising slope from the Fleet to
Temple Bar which later on was the ward of Joce Fitz
Peter, and was ultimately absorbed by the city as part of
Farringdon Without. There would be little objection to
this assignment if we had any further mention of Baynard
in connection with Fleet Street: but we have none.
Another place, Bayswater, equally claims to have been
the holding of Baynard, but this cannot be, for the
simple reason that, as we have seen above, the abbot
had no estate westward of the Tyburn, till he received
Geoffrey's bequest.<note place="foot" n="14">I am inclined to think another and much later Baynard will be found
to have been the abbot's tenant, and to have given his name to Bayswater.</note> Baynard's holding has also been
identified with Lincoln's Inn, but this is almost certainly
an error. I only mention the question, in fact, to show
how little is known, and how easy it is to make and
defend theories which seem always the more plausible
the less we really know.</p>
<p>  The abbot's manor contained all the elements of truly
rural life. There were cottages and ploughs, cattle and
hogs, meadow and woodland, but only twenty-five houses
<quote> of the abbot's knights and of other men.</quote><note place="foot" n="15">It seems to me quite plain from this that either Fleet Street was no
longer in the manor, a theory no one has ever started, or it was still
unbuilt, which latter hypothesis will best square with known facts. For
an opposite view, however, the reader is referred to Mr. Saunders's paper
in Archaeologia, xxvi., already mentioned.</note></p>
<p>  Such was the estate which belonged to the abbey of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> at the beginning of the twelfth century.
But disintegration  was already in progress.    In the
eleventh century, at what exact date is not known, the

king took up his abode either in the abbey, or close to it.
Who was the first king to make a palace at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
we cannot tell. It may have been Canute or one of his
unworthy sons: but it is more likely that Edward the
Confessor, led by the strongly superstitious bent of his
mind, fearing the Londoners more than he loved them,
and thinking himself safer outside the walls than inside,
considered the protection offered by the sacred character
of the cloister of St. Peter sufficient.  Certain it is that he
passed the greater part of his reign at Westminster, and
that he projected and built a church for the monks which
in some respects was probably not inferior to what we
see now. This is evident if we observe that the cloister
still covers the same ground that it covered then. If
there is one architectural feature of the church more
familiar than another to Englishmen and all English-
speaking people it is the <soCalled>Poets' Corner.</soCalled> The Poets'
Corner is formed in the south transept by the projection
into it of a corner of the cloister. When Henry III.
rebuilt church and cloister alike he did not disturb
the Saxon ground plan, and thus the south transept
has no western aisle.<note place="foot" n="16">A glance at the accompanying plan will explain this. I have to thank
Mr. J. Henry Middleton, F.S.A., for leave to use it. In conjunction with
Mr. Micklethwaite, he has been engaged in researches in the abbey for
many years, and it is probable that this plan will prove to be the most
accurate hitherto published.</note> The Confessor's church extended from the modern communion table westward
to a door which opens into the western walk of the
cloister.</p>
 <p> Some fragments of his work may still be identified.
Among them are the arches which lead from the cloister
southward to the school, which have a series of very
curious ancient chambers of the same period adjoining
them. The passage into Little Dean's Yard is modern,






<pb n="42" id="p.42"/>

but many traces of old work are to be seen, including
the break in the vaulting, where a staircase used to lead
up to the dormitory. There is a description of the abbey
in an old manuscript volume in the Harleian collection,<note place="foot" n="17">Printed in 'Lives of Edward,' Rolls Series, p. 417.</note>
which was written for queen Edith, therefore before
<date value="1074">1074</date>, when she died. From it we gather that the church,
which survived until a fire in the reign of Henry III., had
an apse, a central tower, two towers at the western end,
a cloister, a chapter house<note place="foot" n="18">See full account in Scott's 'Gleanings,' p. 3.</note> on the present site, a refectory
and a dormitory, with surrounding offices.        Of these
the crypt of the chapter house, the basement of the
dormitory and the north wall of the refectory are still in
existence. The abbey absorbed the parish church. For a
time, at least, the few parishioners worshipped in the north
aisle of the nave, but the first erection of St. Margaret's
is always attributed to the Confessor.<note place="foot" n="19">Widmore, p. 12.</note> Two theories may
be held on this subject. It may be supposed that the
parish church was dedicated to St. Margaret<note place="foot" n="20">There are five saints of the name in Husenbeth's ' Emblems,' p. 109.
Of these the dates exclude St. Margaret of Cortona, St. Margaret of Scotland, and B. Margaret of Hungary. B. Margaret of Castello is the fourth;
and the fifth, who must be identified with the church of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, is
St. Margaret, a virgin martyr in the fourth century. She is frequently
represented in local sculpture as rising from a dragon which has her robe
in his mouth.</note>  before the
abbey was placed on Thorney, or it may be thought that
the dedication was a new one. In favour of this second
view must be put the absence of the name from early
charters; but we have no better evidence either way,
and no contemporary record of the building of the
church.</p>
<p>  There continued, however, an altar, called the <soCalled>Jesus
altar,</soCalled> for the parishioners in the abbey church. There

                 <pb n="43" id="p.43"/>

 has been some misapprehension as to its position though
  it remained till the abolition of chantries.  In fact there
  were two such altars.  One of them stood at the eastern
  end of the nave, where is now the entrance to the choir.
  It was elevated on steps and shut in with side screens.
Above it was a large rood screen, extending across the
  whole church, and to the eastward, at the same level as
  the rood screen, was an upstairs oratory, called, like the
  altar below, after our Saviour. To these two places the
  parishioners obtained access, as well as to their own
  church in the churchyard.<note place="foot" n="21">I am much indebted to Mr. Middleton for this information.</note></p>
<p>    Although St. Margaret's cannot compete with the
  abbey church in its interesting associations, there is yet
  much to record of it.   Restoration after restoration has
  removed every trace of antiquity from its walls. Even
  the churchyard, with its venerable gravestones, has been
  desecrated, the inscriptions obliterated or covered, and
  much that was curious or interesting destroyed. It is sad
  to think that such vandalisms should have been carried
  out within the past two years, and under the name of
  improvements. The work, indeed, was begun at a time
  when there was, if possible, even less reverence than at
  present for antiquity, for one of the earliest parliamentary
  grants for the repair of St. Margaret's was made the year
  after the execution of Charles I.<note place="foot" n="22">Walcott, ' Westminster,' a compilation which must be referred to with
  caution, though it is the most accessible book on the subject. It is somewhat unfortunate that both the modern historians of the abbey and of the
  adjacent church should have been so little characterised by historical
  accuracy that none of their assertions can be received without proof. I
have avoided in this chapter as far as possible references to Dean Stanley's
and Precentor Walcott's books.</note> There were further
  repairs several times before <date value="1780">1780</date>, which is the date on
  the leaden spouting; and in <date value="1845">1845</date> there was a vote of





<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>


1200&#x00A3; which produced most disastrous results. Since
that time St. Margaret's has been a new church, and
seven years ago it was still further <soCalled>restored</soCalled>. The
House of Commons has, ever since the time of the
great rebellion, looked on this church as its peculiar
care, and when we see what has come of it, we cannot
but rejoice that they extend their attention to no other
London churches.</p>
<p>   There are a few names connected with St. Margaret's,
however, that even the omnipotence of an act of parliament, or the marauding hand of the restorer, cannot quite
obscure. It requires an effort of mind to remember in
the new church such ancient worthies as Chaucer, Caxton,
and Sir <persName key="Raleigh, Walter">Walter Raleigh</persName>. Until last year there remained
also a tangible memorial to <persName key="Cowper, William">William Cowper</persName>. There is now
only a memory, and he is as unreal at St. Margaret's as
the other three. It would be curious to know if Caxton
when he wrote with such warm admiration of Chaucer.
was aware that the great poet lived close to St. Margaret's, in a house on the site of Henry VII.'s chapel,
while he was clerk of the works at the abbey. It was in
St. Margaret's that the heralds held their inquiry as to
the Scrope and Grosvenor arms in <date value="1386">1386</date>, when Chaucer
gave the evidence before them which has proved of such
importance to his biographers.<note place="foot" n="23">It is noticed above, chap. ix. p. 257.</note>  Caxton lived near the
western end of the abbey, in a house called the <soCalled>Reed
Pale,</soCalled> which may be translated, perhaps, by <soCalled>red paling,</soCalled>
which stood very near the spot marked now by the
Crimean memorial column-a <soCalled>pale</soCalled> of red granite. He
probably died in <date value="1491">1491</date> , as, though registers had not yet been
invented, the churchwarden's accounts record the expenditure, midway between <date value="1490">1490</date> and <date value="1492">1492</date>, of 6s. 8d. for
torches, and 6d. for bell ringing at the <quote>bureyng of

 William Caxton.</quote><note place="foot" n="24">The volume in which the entry occurs was shown in the Caxton
Exhibition at South Kensington in <date value="1877">1877</date>.</note>  He well deserved this favour from
 the parish, to which he had bequeathed some copies of
 his 'Golden Legend,' which were sold by the churchwardens for the benefit of the poor. In <date value="1496">1496</date>, for instance,
 we have the entry of the receipt of 6s. 8d. for " oone of
 thoo printed bokes that were bequothen to the churche
 behove by William Caxton." That Caxton was buried
 within and not without the church was a matter of faith
 with Dr. Dibdin and the bibliographers of his time; and
 in <date value="1820">1820</date> the Roxburgh Society put up a tablet to his
 memory in the south aisle, near the east end.</p>
   <p>Although the probable site of his house is that which
I have indicated, it must be remembered that before this
quarter of the town was rased to the ground, the building
which was locally called by his name, and which stood
here, was not two hundred years old. It may, of course,
have occupied an older site. The house of Caxton was
in the Almonry. The Almonry was just here. Therefore, to put the matter in logical form, one of the houses
on this site was his. Caxton was a member of the
mercers' company, as we saw above.<note place="foot" n="25">Chap. ix. p. 267.</note> There were many
houses in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> held by the company from the
abbot, and he may, as Mr. Blades, his latest and best
biographer asserts, have hired one of them. This is by
no means certain.<note place="foot" n="26">The mercers have a good many houses in and about Long Acre,
adjoining the Convent, or Covent Garden. Their badge is still to be
seen in St. Martin's Lane and Long Acre.</note> Nor is it as certain as Mr. Blades
would wish us to believe that this was Caxton's only
connection with the abbot. At the same time, in the
absence of trustworthy information to the contrary, we
had best withhold our final judgment, and agreeing that



<pb n="46" id="p.46"/>

Caxton lived very near the Crimean memorial, and that
Stow is wrong in making abbot Islip his patron, since
Caxton died before Islip was elected, we may accept the
little that we do know and see how far it connects him
with <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> and Westminster Abbey. In one of
his prologues he mentions the fact that abbot Esteney
"did do shewe" him certain evidences: that is, abbot
Esteney allowed them to be shown to him. There is
nothing in this to. prove that the abbot and the printer
ever came into personal contact. When we consider
that the lord abbot of such an establishment not only
held a high social rank, but also belonged to a society of
monks, more or less recluse in their habits, it is possible
that Caxton never so much as saw an abbot of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> in his life. He was, in fact, while he lived at the
Red Pale, in the position of a retired wool stapler of
moderate means, who had returned from the Low
Countries, after long dealings with the merchants whom
the commercially minded Edward IV. had established
so near his own palace, and had naturally gravitated to
the neighbourhood of the market place where his fortune
had been founded. He had been thirty-five years abroad,
and had imbibed at Bruges some of the artistic tastes
which fostered the contemporary genius of Van Eyck
and Memling. His literary ability had been stimulated by communication with Colard Mansion and other
learned men, and when he came home and settled in the
Almonry, he took to printing as he had learned it
abroad, to fill up his leisure, to give himself an opportunity of publishing his own voluminous works, and,
possibly, to add to the small savings he had brought
home with him. He conducted the business, if, indeed,
it can be called a business, which must have been much
more of an amusement, with the same instinctive skill



 <pb n="47" id="p.47"/>

and care which had characterised his mercantile work at
Bruges: and the result leaves him in a high rank among
the founders of the selection of words from various
sources which we call the English language. Caxton,
as Mr. Green<note place="foot" n="27">ii. 56.</note> well remarks, stood between two schools
of translation, that of French affectation and that of
English pedantry. He only took to printing as the
employment of his declining years. He survived his
return home only fifteen years. But during the time he
lived in the Almonry he must have worked with prodigious energy, both at the press and in the study, and
he certainly contrived before his death to make printing
popular among his countrymen. He printed and published during that time about a hundred different volumes
and tracts, of which some ninety-four have been identified. Several of them have been found made into pasteboard for bindings, the greatest discovery of the kind
having been at St. Albans a few years ago. The British
Museum preserves eighty volumes from his press. Thirty-three of his books are only known by a single example
or by imperfect copies, and the greatest number of copies
of any one work is only twenty-nine. The modern
bibliomaniac thinks with longing of the time when a
churchwarden of St. Margaret's could sell the 'Golden
Legend' for 6s. 8d.</p>
<p>  The woollen market, or wool staple, at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
was looked upon with jealous eyes by the neighbouring
citizens of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. The market house stood just where
the modern Westminster Bridge springs from its abutments. It was destroyed in <date value="1741">1741</date>, being then surrounded
by other buildings, for all of which the sum of &#x00A3;840 was
paid by authority of an act of parliament.<note place="foot" n="28">Smith, p. 261.</note> A new place
on which to hold a market was obtained from the dean


<pb n="48" id="p.48"/>

and chapter in the Broad Sanctuary, but the only building
of a civic character that remains is the so-called  <soCalled>Guildhall.</soCalled> It stands on the site of a tower in which, before
the western end of the abbey church was completed, the
bells were hung. The staple owed its origin to one of
the periodical fits of anger against the Londoners in
which Henry III. used to indulge. He ordered the city
shops to be closed for fifteen days in October, <date value="1248">1248</date>, and
held a fair in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. This fair became an annual
occurrence, and was under the immediate control of the
abbot, who appointed a vacant space in Tothill Fields
for its celebration. The privilege of holding it was one
among the many causes of the quarrel between the abbot
and the citizens which Simon de Montfort in vain
endeavoured to settle.<note place="foot" n="29">See above, vol. i. chap. v.</note> A more regular market was
established by statute in <date value="1353">1353</date>, when, to encourage the
trade in wool, its headquarters were fixed at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
and a "mayor of the staple" was appointed to superintend it. Edward IV. had extensive dealings in wool,
and the <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> staple flourished for many generations. It is possibly owing to its existence on this spot
that the mercers' company rented houses from the dean
and chapter. The principal scene of operations was
north of Bridge Street, then the Weighhouse Lane,
at the foot of which was a floating pier, or <soCalled>bridge</soCalled>,
marked in many old maps and views. In the eighteenth
century an attempt was also made to set up a fish
market, but it failed, owing as was said to the opposition of the city fishmongers and the merchants of
<placeName key="Billingsgate">Billingsgate</placeName>.</p>
<p>  Although Raleigh's headless body was laid in the
chancel more than a century after Caxton's death, the
appearance of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> had not, in spite of the suppression

 <pb n="49" id="p.49"/>

of the monasteries, undergone a very great
change. The alterations of the last two hundred years
have been far greater. Hollar, who, according to one
account, was himself buried near the north-western corner
of the tower, has preserved for us much of the look of
the place fifty years later. When the wide roadway
which now passes between the east ends of the two
churches and the condemned law courts, was known as
St. Margaret's Lane, and was full of houses; when a
gateway stood where lord Derby's statue stands now,
and another close to the chapel of Henry VII.; when
other gateways marked the end of King Street, and the
entrance of the Sanctuary; when the busy corner where
Parliament Street now opens into Bridge Street was part
of a continuous row of houses reaching to the water gate
at the river's edge, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> presented an aspect very
different from that open expanse of grass and flower
beds which we now see, and the ungraceful tower of
St. Margaret's came into no competition, either with the
abbey towers, which were not built till <date value="1720">1720</date>, or with the
<soCalled>pagoda</soCalled> clock tower or the other ornamental features
of the new palace of parliament. A network of government offices, narrow gardens, canons' houses, gothic
archways, almonries, and chapels filled all the space now
cleared and green. The buildings encroached on the
churchyard and even on the abbey. Many of us can
easily remember, before Victoria Street was thought of,
that the Dean's yard was only one of a number of
miserable little squares and narrow lanes of squalid
houses, a nest of fever and vice, the despair of reformers
and the delight of antiquaries.<note place="foot" n="30">Smith, in his 'Antiquities of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,' and Archer in his 'Old
London,' have preserved many of the picturesque features left standing in
the present century.</note> Now only the hall and

<pb n="50" id="p.50"/>

some minor parts of the old palace can be found. King
Street has nearly disappeared and is no longer a principal
thoroughfare.  The clock tower near the hall, the
abbot's prison and the conduit, close to which Raleigh's
scaffold stood, have all departed, and left not a "rack
behind." The time of William Cowper seems now, so far
as <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> is concerned, equally remote as that of
Raleigh. It was in the churchyard of St. Margaret's,
while he was a scholar at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, that he received one of those impressions which had so strong an
effect on his after life. Crossing the burial ground one
dark evening towards his home in the school, he saw the
glimmering lantern of a grave-digger at work. He approached to look on, with a boyish craving for horrors,
and was struck by a skull heedlessly thrown out of the
crowded earth. To the mind of <persName key="Cowper, William">William Cowper</persName> such an
accident had an extraordinary significance. In after life
he remembered it as the occasion of religious emotions not
readily suppressed. On the south side of the church, until
the recent "restoration," there was a stone, the inscription
on which suggests the less gloomy view of Cowper's
character. It marked "The Burial Place of Mr. John
Gilpin"; the date was not to be made out, but it must
have been fresh when Cowper was at school: and it would
be absurd to doubt that the future poet had seen it, and
perhaps unconsciously adopted from it the name of his
hero.</p>
<p>  The domestic buildings of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Abbey have
been so effectually disguised and altered that it is
almost if not quite impossible to make any complete
plan of what they were. Mr. Middleton's map gives
the results of the latest investigations. Though, as I have
said, there is not much in proportion of the Confessor's
work still to be seen its remains are in reality more
extensive than is generally supposed. Many people were

     <pb n="51" id="p.51"/>

lately anxious as to the fate of a building standing in the
so-called <soCalled>Little Dean's Yard,</soCalled> a square on the south
side of the cloister. Ashburnham House, which is reasonably believed to have been built by <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName>, has, like
a kind of backbone running along the whole building from
end to end, a thick wall of very ancient masonry, pierced
here and there with modern doorways, in which its
immense solidity is apparent. This was the southern
side of the <soCalled>Misericorde</soCalled>, or place of indulgence, an
adjunct to the refectory, where the monks who, for any
special reason had obtained leave, ate and drank the cakes
and beer provided out of some charitable fund for their
benefit. Across the garden of the house is seen another
great wall, pierced with round arched openings. Here
stood the refectory. The dormitory has suffered even
more; it is now in part a school-room, and has been so
much altered and defaced that its very form is made out
with difficulty. All these buildings are survivals, more
or less complete, of the Confessor's work. His own
palace stood eastward of the monastery, yet in places
connected with it. So completely has everything been
changed by the building of the houses of parliament, that
it is difficult to identify even the ground on which the
older buildings stood. But after the disastrous fire of
<date value="1834">1834</date>, it was found that the Confessor's work was greater
than had been supposed, and that very little of Henry
III.'s palace took up fresh ground.</p>
  <p> Two buildings stood at right angles to each other, the
 chapel of St. Stephen and the so-called Painted Chamber.
 The house of commons sat in the chapel, the house of
 lords in the painted chamber, which was also sometimes
 described as the white hall<note place="foot" n="31">A name which misled Brayley into confounding it with Whitehall,
 otherwise York Place, 'Ancient Palace,' p. 357. There was a <soCalled>white
 chamber</soCalled> in the palace, as well.</note> and the court of requests.



<pb n="52" id="p.52"/>

This was the principal feature of Edward's palace, and
if we could replace it as it was, we should find it covering
the statue of Richard I., which now stands in the angle
formed by the south front of Westminster Hall and
the modern buildings. The windows to the east of the
great hall window light St. Stephen's Gallery, which
occupies the site of the chapel. It is believed that Sir
Charles Barry might have saved and restored the chapel<note place="foot" n="32">Fergusson.</note>
badly as it was damaged by the fire; but, to judge by
the <soCalled>restoration</soCalled> of its crypt, we should not have been
much the better.</p>
  <p>There is evidence that the southern end, at least, of
Westminster Hall is of very early work. But the present
hall is due to Richard II., and the previous building was
that of <persName key="Rufus, William">William Rufus</persName>, and must have been smaller. We
can therefore say nothing of what the Confessor built
here. When the cloister court was formed on the east
side, the buildings came to the river's edge, and the site
afterwards occupied by the Speaker's Garden, and now
by the principal buildings of the houses of parliament, was
under water. The Speaker's house stood almost where
the lobby of the House of Commons is now, having been
formed out of a row of lodgings for the priests connected
with the collegiate chapel of St. Stephen.</p>
  <p> Henry III. added much to the palace. When we consider the magnitude of this king's architectural schemes,
we need not seek further for any explanation of his constant want of money, and the endless demands he made
upon the citizens of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. In a future chapter I shall
have something to say of his buildings at the Tower. At
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> he not only almost rebuilt the Confessor's
church, but spent lavish sums on his own palace. Some
of his chambers were fancifully named, perhaps from the

<pb n="53" id="p.53"/>

character of their decorations : as the Antioch chamber,
from a picture of the siege of Antioch by the crusaders.
In the deanery to this day there is a <soCalled>chamber called
Jerusalem,</soCalled> now   generally  misnamed   the  Jerusalem
chamber, and another called Jericho. In the old palace
there was Heaven, Paradise, Purgatory, and even Hell.<note place="foot" n="33">In one of the canons' houses at Canterbury there is still an ancient
room called Paradise.</note>
The last named was as nearly as possible the judges' retiring room in the modern Court of Queen's Bench, now
condemned to destruction. This corner, in Tudor times,
was the royal nursery.<note place="foot" n="34">The reader is referred to Smith's ' Westminster,' and to Brayley and
Britton's 'Ancient Palace of Parliament,' for full and accurate accounts
of the old buildings.</note></p>
<p>  Of the law courts at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> we have heard much
in late years.  The king's judges used to travel with
him, but many of our early sovereigns sat as a matter of
course to hear cases. Henry III. sat in the Court of Exchequer in <date value="1248">1248</date> and <date value="1256">1256</date>. James I. is the last king who
<soCalled>came to judgment.</soCalled>  Westminster Hall very gradually
became the head quarters of the law courts, but that they
were at least occasionally fixed here appears from a
report of pleas as early as <date value="1200">1200</date>. They were not, however, absolved from travelling after the king till <date value="1224">1224</date>,
when the judges commenced to sit in the hall, as they
have, nominally at least, sat ever since until now. There
are some curious views extant of the different courts,<note place="foot" n="35">See some fine plates in 'Archaeologia,' vol. xxxix.</note>
and various chambers were at different times appropriated
to them. Edward I., however, took the judges to Shrewsbury in <date value="1277">1277</date> to assist in trying Llewellyn, Prince of
Wales. In <date value="1289">1289</date> he made inquiries into the administration of justice at Westminster and punished nearly all
his judges for taking bribes. It is said that a bell tower,




<pb n="54" id="p.54"/>

<figure id="Fig.005" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.022.DO01.00004"><head>WESTMINSTER HALL IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</head></figure>
opposite the entrance of Westminster Hall was erected
with the proceeds of the fines, but, if so, it was completely rebuilt by Edward III., and subsequently became
a clock tower, and as such is figured in some of Hollar's
views. There was also a bell tower within the palace,
and it is not easy to unravel the intricacy of the accounts
as to which of them is meant by the record.</p>
<p>  Of the modern houses of parliament much might be
said did space and time permit. The new palace is the
result of a long series of more or less stupid mistakes,
and more or less ignorant experiments. That it is so
satisfactory can only be accounted for by the enormous
amount of money spent. Seen from the river the front
has a symmetry not wholly unpleasing; but marred
by the comparative lowness of the central part of
the facade, which deprives it of dignity. The landward
side is wanting in unity and seems to straggle. Much
the most picturesque parts of the building are the little
known courts, where no attempt at ornament or symmetry was made, and where the irregular beauties of the
style assert themselves rather in spite of the architect
than with his help. The ground plan looks well on paper.
The way in which Westminster Hall was worked into the
design, the octagon, with the four passages leading to it and
the simplicity of the lobby arrangements, account for the
ease with which a stranger can find his way about. The
royal entrance under the southern tower, by an archway
sixty feet high, and a wide staircase leading to the splendid
but meaningless royal gallery, is very fine and grand. It
is but too easy to find fault. The decorations are oppressive in their number and monotony. The architect knew
little about the Tudor style, and could give no variety.
On the exterior the pannelling is simply tiresome, while
only the central tower can be considered beautiful. The


<pb n="55" id="p.55"/>

great Victoria tower might have been one of Wren's
gothic efforts, and differs chiefly in size from the tower of
St. Mary Aldermary. Of the clock tower it is more than
sufficient condemnation to say one is constantly tempted
to call it the <soCalled>clock case,</soCalled> so exactly does it resemble a
common or domestic article of furniture. It still bears
the mark of recent completion ; for Barry hoped to have
been allowed to make New Palace Yard a quadrangle,
and to have erected a great gateway, the design of which
with its high pitched roof is well known, and more nearly
approaches picturesqueness than anything else he did in
this style. In short, the palace is what might have been
expected when we forced the greatest master of the
Italian style we had in England to build in gothic; just
as, a little later we compelled our greatest gothic architect
to build the new government offices in an Italian style.
The offices in St. James's Park are, however, among Sir
Gilbert Scott's most picturesque works, while it cannot
be said that anything except the ground plan at the
palace of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> is worthy of the artist who
designed Bridgewater House and the Reform Club in
Pall Mall.</p>
<p>  Westminster hall was, practically, renewed by Barry,
who removed the southern end, placed the window a few
feet back, and made room for a broad platform or landing
for the staircase which opens from  the western side,
facing Henry VII.'s chapel. It is difficult to realise now
the old appearance of the hall.<note place="foot" n="36">A copy of a view made early in the eighteenth century is among the
accompanying plates.</note> The little shops, as
archbishop Laud notes in his diary,<note place="foot" n="37">Quoted by Timbs, p. 829.</note> took fire in <date value="1631">1631</date>,
but the damage was insignificant: and the noble oak
roof was spared. It was found to be in a very rickety

<pb n="56" id="p.56"/>

state in <date value="1820">1820</date>, and forty loads of old ship's timbers were
brought from Portsmouth to repair it, and to complete
the northern end, which had never been quite finished.
A somewhat similar restoration had been made of the
curious frieze of the badges and crests of Richard II.
which surrounds the whole building, a few years earlier.
Some relics of Norman work were obliterated under
Barry<note place="foot" n="38">See view in Brayley and Britton, plate viii.</note>; and as the whole has been refaced, a great
arch erected in the eastern wall to form a members'
entrance to the cloisters, a wide flight of steps built at
the southern end, and some not very interesting statues
of English kings and queens set up on the east side, it
would not be easy, but for the roof, to find anything in
the Westminster hall of to-day which was there when
the estates of the realm met here to choose a new king.
The walls <quote>were hung and trimmed sumptuously,</quote> and
a vacant throne stood in the midst. Near it sat the
duke of Lancaster, ready to ascend it as soon as the
voice of the assembly had declared him Richard's successor. This was the first great pageant in the new hall.
Since then it has seen many another. Here Oldcastle
was tried and condemned. <persName key="Seymour, Edward">Edward Seymour</persName>, duke of
Somerset, and sometime lord protector of the realm, was
tried in Westminster Hall, before his peers, the marquis
of Winchester, lord treasurer, sitting as high steward.<note place="foot" n="39">See several of these trials in Mr. Bell's ' Chapel in the Tower.'
</note>
Not long after, his great enemy, <persName key="Dudley, John">John Dudley</persName>, duke of
Northumberland, was sentenced to death in the same
hall. The duke of Norfolk, under queen Elizabeth, was
tried in Westminster hall, the earl of Shrewsbury being
high steward. Here Strafford and his unhappy master
met for the last time, when Charles and his queen attended the trial. Here Charles himself encountered

                 <pb n="57" id="p.57"/>

Bradshaw and his assessors, and bore himself in more
royal wise than at any other conjuncture of his reign.
Here the seven bishops were acquitted, and the Scots
lords condemned. The trial of Warren Hastings was
opened in Westminster hall, a trial which is rendered the
more memorable by lord Macaulay's eloquent description
of its commencement.<note place="foot" n="40">It is often asserted that queen Anne Boleyn was tried in Westminster
hall. Mr. Bell has shown that the high steward and his court sat in the
"King's hall " in the White Tower, p. 101.</note></p>
  <p>The palace of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> was occasionally inhabited
by Henry VIII.: but after he had taken Whitehall from
Wolsey, and St. James's from the nuns of the hospital,
it ceased to be a royal residence. It had been much
damaged by fire in the early part of Henry's reign, and
when he obtained or seized Whitehall, he must have been
very poorly lodged at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, which may account
for his love of Bridewell. When the papal ascendancy
had been thrown off, and the monks had been banished
from St. Peter's abbey, the king can have had little object
in residing among some ruinous buildings, disendowed
chapels, desecrated shrines, and-if Henry had anything
like sentiment or superstition left in his selfish mind-the
graves of his father and his mother, which he had deprived of the services they had thought so needful to their
repose, and had tried to secure by so many safeguards.
It was but a few years before the final suppression that
Henry VIII. received the renewed oath of an abbot of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, to provide the accustomed masses in the
chapel of Henry VII.<note place="foot" n="41">Syllabus of Rymer's' Foedera,' p. 773, 12 May, <date value="1533">1533</date>. Abbot Benson,
or Boston, surrendered on the 16th January, <date value="1540">1540</date>, and was appointed first
dean.</note> Some of the ancient observances
continued to be celebrated in the chapel of Henry VII.
till the end of his son's reign: but ceased immediately on

<pb n="58" id="p.58"/>

the accession of Edward VI.: who was himself buried
under the altar of the chapel, an altar of beautiful renascence work, portions of which have lately been recovered
and replaced.<note place="foot" n="42"></note>Mr. Middleton obtained the restitution of a portion of the altar from a
museum at Oxford in <date value="1879">1879</date>.</p>
<p>Since Henry III. had consecrated the mound of
holy earth he had obtained from Palestine, by the translation of the body of Edward the Confessor, most of his
descendants had chosen the chapel behind the high altar
for their tombs. Many of Henry VII.'s descendants were
buried in his chapel, but the body of George III. was
laid beside those of Charles I., Henry VIII., Edward IV.,
and Henry VI. in the chapel of St. George, adjoining
the royal palace at Windsor. Henry III. reserved the
Confessor's ancient coffin for himself and the bones of the
saint were laid in a magnificent shrine, the mere remains of
which are all we can now see. It is even doubtful, if any
of the <soCalled>holy relics</soCalled> are still in the tomb, which was
renewed by queen Mary and again by James II.   At
the north side is the monument with its effigy of Henry
III., completed ten years after his death by the piety of
Edward I., whose own tomb is as plain and solid as if it
had been hewn out of one of the Welsh or Scottish hills
among which he wrought his mighty deeds. The plainness of Edward's tomb is the more remarkable because of
the magnificence he bestowed on the tombs of his father
and of his wife, whose figure, if it be indeed a portrait, is
the first we have of any English sovereign, since it was
completed before that of her father-in-law, Henry III.
The cross Edward made in her honour at Charing
remains there still in name, though the statue of Charles
I. occupies the site; but the modern cross which so unmeaningly decorates the approach to the neighbouring

<pb n="59" id="p.59"/>

railway station, is probably as faithful a reproduction as
can be expected in the nineteenth century of the sculpture
and architecture of the thirteenth. Edward also completed his father's design for rebuilding the abbey church,
and added the four westernmost bays to the nave. When
Edward himself was dying in <date value="1307">1307</date>, at Burgh-on-the-
Sands in Cumberland, he desired them to boil down his
body in a cauldron, and to carry the bones against the
rebels to <quote>the very extremity of Scotland.</quote> But Edward
II. was not the man to fulfil such directions. The body
was embalmed and brought to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, wrapped in
cerecloth, and at intervals the tomb was opened, and a
fresh winding sheet placed about it. The last of these
renewals took place as late as the time of Henry V. In
<date value="1774">1774</date> the tomb was again opened. A black marble coffin
was found within the rough sarcophagus.  The cerecloth
was intact, and showed how carefully it had been applied
for even each finger had its bandage. The body wore
over its shroud the royal robes, with gilt crown and
sceptre, and in this state it still lies.</p>
<p>  It has several times been found easy to fill a volume
with accounts of the tombs and monuments of Westminster Abbey. I shall notice here only a few. Edward III.
rests near his grandfather, and close to him his wife.
Near them is their unfortunate grandson Richard II. and
his first wife, Anne of Bohemia. The effigy of the king
was placed beside that of his consort in his own lifetime
his hand clasping hers. Below was formerly the touching
inscription, <quote>I have been most happy and most miserable,</quote>
the effect of which must have been somewhat marred by
other lines of the epitaph, and in particular by the rhyming hexameters.<note place="foot" n="43">Noticed above, vol. i. p. 251.</note></p>
 <p> One more royal tomb must be mentioned. The chantry




<pb n="60" id="p.60"/>

of Henry V. is not open to the public, and is seldom fully
described. It consists of a kind of stone platform erected
over the tomb, which is well known, with its headless oaken
effigy. The western side of the screen consists of two
slender staircases, so arranged that with the floor of the
platform they assume the shape of the letter H. Over it
is a cross beam on which were suspended the helmet,
saddle, and shield, supplied by the undertakers for his state
funeral.<note place="foot" n="44">Dean Stanley seems to have thought they were his veritable arms,
p. 149.</note> The shield, according to the engraving of it by
Sandford, represented France. There may have been
another for England, but it has disappeared. The chantry
itself is a wide space surrounded by low walls from which
excellent bird's eye views may be obtained all over the
church. No doubt, the people, far down in the nave
at the Jesus altar were able to see the elevation of the
host as the daily mass was performed in the chantry
above.</p>
<p>  Scarcely less important than the tombs of kings are those
of their greatest ministers. Though lord Beaconsfield, who
knew how the mighty dead jostle each other, so to speak,
in Westminster Abbey, and how one's feelings of reverence
at seeing the grave of one remarkable man, are immediately diverted to see another, chose rather to be buried
in a country churchyard, yet few of his predecessors
escaped the questionable honour. It comes to pass from
their number, that one overlooks even the tombs of such
men as the Pitts, whereas the solitary monument of lord
Melbourne, in St. Paul's, is always conspicuous. But it
may be safely said that of the thousands of altar tombs,
tablets, cenotaphs, statues, busts, and other memorials, in
the abbey, there is not one so simple, so mournful, so
beautiful that it is not excelled by the black doorway in



          <pb n="61" id="p.61"/>

St. Paul's, and the pale angels that guard it.<note place="foot" n="45">Had Marochetti never executed any work but this he would have
been reckoned a great sculptor. But he also made the statue of Richard I.
in Old Palace Yard.</note> The
citizens of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> would fain have buried Chatham  in
their cathedral. We have seen how he was loved in the
city,<note place="foot" n="46">Chapter xiv.</note> and are not surprised that they would, as Walpole
sneeringly observes, " have robbed Peter to pay Paul."
The statue, which was eventually placed in the abbey,
would unquestionably have looked better in the cathedral.
Bacon set an example in modelling the figure in modern
dress and parliamentary robes, and, strange to say, not
only designed the monument, but wrote the inscription.
No inscription was ever placed on the monument of
Perceval.</p>
<p>  Of late years, with a view to economising space and
fees, it has been the custom to put up little busts on brackets in all sorts of corners. The effect is intolerable.
We talk of the incongruous monuments of General Wolfe
or Mrs. Nightingale, but at least they are fine works of
art. A naked quarter length of the late Mr. John Keble
on a Greek pedestal, is fifty times more incongruous, and
bad, besides, in itself. It is impossible not to regret that
Dickens's dying wish was disregarded and that his body
does not rest among the scenes he loved best, and where
it would have been in a sense, an honour to the place.
Here it is lost. In fact, the monuments<note place="foot" n="47">The best account of the illustrious dead here interred is in the lamented
Colonel Chester's book on the ' Registers of Westminster Abbey.'</note> have become so
numerous and so often commemorate people whom
futurity will consider entitled to be called eminent chiefly
because they have their memorials here, that a visit to the
church is not what it was in the days of Addison and
Sir Roger de Coverley, or Johnson and Goldsmith.</p>


<pb n="62" id="p.62"/>

  <p>The triforium of Westminster Abbey is just as full of
objects of interest as every other part of the church.
Yet it is not altogether a pleasant place to visit. One
does not always wish to get behind, or, as in this case,
above, the scenes. Even ancient abbeys have their seamy
side. It is not at first possible to realise the value of every
little heap of dust and rubbish which has accumulated
here during so many centuries.  A bundle of broken
boards was once the canopy of a great king's tomb, removed to make way for the tomb of a greater than he.
A heap of red fragments of terra-cotta were once the
priceless images with which Torregiano decorated the
high altar of Henry's sumptous chapel. A magnificently
modelled <soCalled>torso,</soCalled> worthy of Michael Angelo, is among
them, and some pedestals which still bear the <soCalled>beautiful feet</soCalled> of little angels. Tied up into faggots are the
iron rails that bore the pall which concealed the plainness of the tomb of Edward I. In one corner is the sole
remaining cope chest. In another are the curious little
wooden obelisks which stood at either side of the choir
gate when Dart made his view. Perched high up on
beams are more than a hundred helmets, some of them
still bearing their crests, which like that of Henry V. have
come into the abbey with funerals. At the western end
of the south side is a room which Bradshaw occupied in
the days of the commonwealth. It communicates with
the deanery which was granted to him, and here it is said
by tradition he died.  His ghost haunts the gloomy
chamber still, and walks the triforium on the nights of the
30th January and the 22nd November.</p>
 <p> In a chantry over the Islip chapel is the very curious
and interesting collection of waxworks. For some reason
the later deans have not been anxious that the public
should see these characteristic figures, and some of the

<pb n="63" id="p.63"/>

more ancient are believed to have been locked away out
of sight.<note place="foot" n="48">Dean Stanley is careful to say very little about them, and excludes the
 word " waxwork" from his index.</note>  The commanding figure of Chatham in his
robes, the imperious face of Elizabeth, the dingy image
of Charles II. in its splendid point lace, the ghastly duke
of Buckingham lying dead on his bier, but above all
little William III. propped on a footstool beside his tall
wife, both evidently portraits, and by no mean artist,
should be visible to all who care to see them.</p>
<p>  The transfer of Westminster from the abbot and his
monks to the dean and his canons was made gentle by
two circumstances. There were only 17 monks in the
house at the suppression: and the last abbot became
the first dean. The short-lived bishopric which made
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> a city, and the <soCalled>collegiate church</soCalled> or royal
chapel, a cathedral, helped also to keep alive the old
feeling of the greatness of the place, for though a dean
was nothing in comparison with a lord abbot, controlling
an income which would now be reckoned at about
6o,oool. a year, a bishop was a peer of Parliament, and
bishop Thurlby turned the late abbot, now dean, out of
the abbot's house and made it his palace. The dean
made a house of the old Misericorde, already mentioned.
Dean Benson, who had reigned for a brief period as
abbot Boston, a name he derived from his birthplace, was
one of these implements which kings like Henry, and
ministers like <persName key="Cromwell, Thomas">Thomas Cromwell</persName>, always find ready to

<pb n="64" id="p.64"/>

brought from Burton-upon-Trent, to fill it. About the
same time three manors which belonged to the abbey were
pledged, or mortgaged, for 500&#x00A3;, a large sum of money
in those days. It was paid to Sir William Pawlet and to
one <persName key="Cromwell, Thomas">Thomas Cromwell</persName>, not yet so well known to fame
as he afterwards became. The new abbot was the first
for three centuries who had not belonged to the house,
and he played to perfection the part of the hireling shepherd. At the suppression he descended from his lofty
station and became, as we have seen, the first dean, and
Thurlby became first and last bishop of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.
Meanwhile Benson exerted himself to save some of the
abbey estates for the new chapter, and partially succeeded,
his exertions, it is probable, rather than his conscience,
causing his death in <date value="1549">1549</date>. He could not save the abbot's
house, which on the suppression of the new see was given
to the omnivorous lord Wentworth, who died in it
immediately afterwards and was buried among the
abbots. A second dean, Cox, inhabited the altered
Misericorde, and on his flight a third, Weston, who had
to make way for queen Mary's restored abbot. It was
this Feckenham, so called from his birthplace in Suffolk,
his family name being Howman, to whom the modern
deans should be grateful for having obtained the abbot's
house for them, as he effected an exchange with the new
lord Wentworth, giving up to him instead the manor of
Canonbury. It was this second lord Wentworth whose
loss of Calais so deeply grieved queen Mary, and with
Mary's life practically ended the rule of the last abbot.
But the new deanery house was never again inhabited by
a dean, and its subsequent history, which has been the
subject of so much controversy of late, ends by disconnecting it from the abbey.</p>
<p>  Queen Elizabeth founded Westminster School, and it


           <pb n="65" id="p.65"/>

has often, without foundation, been asserted that <persName key="Bacon, Francis">Francis
Bacon</persName> was among the early scholars. The queen is said,
at one of her visits, to have asked him how often he had
been flogged, on which the precocious boy replied in a
line from Virgil-

me, O queen, to recall unspeakable woe.</quote> Book ii., line 3.</note>

At first the school and the abbey were very closely connected. Dean Goodman was a kind of headmaster, and
even took boarders into the deanery. This connection
subsists no longer. The encroachments of the school
have long been viewed with disfavour by the chapter;
and when just before the death of the lamented dean
Stanley, the unwilling fulfilment of a <soCalled>promise to their
loss</soCalled> deprived them of the original deanery, which had
long been a canon's residence, under the name of Ashburnham House, it was felt that the circumstances delicately described by the dean had been reversed. He
spoke of the interests of the school having been occasionally overshadowed by those of the chapter. If so the
cession of Ashburnham House, in <date value="1881">1881</date>, and since then
that of the organist's house close by show that it is now
the turn of the school.</p>
<p>  Ashburnham House requires more than a passing
mention. It stands as I have said, across the very wall
of the Misericorde, and its garden looked on the little
that is left of the Refectory. How far the school will
injure it I know not, but visitors who remember its
delicate carved panelling and the fragile stucco work,
will tremble for its fate. There seems to be no authentic
proof that it was designed by <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName>: but the
negative proof that he only could have designed it is very





<pb n="66" id="p.66"/>

strong. It was unquestionably built in his time for the
lessee or grantee whose name it has since borne, and
with an ordinary but not unpleasing exterior, is arranged
and decorated within in a style which justifies what was
said of it by one of the objectors to the transfer :-it
stands to modern domestic architecture as St. Stephen's
Wallbrook stands to ecclesiastical, as showing the power
of a master to produce in a moderate space and with
ordinary materials an effect perfectly satisfactory.<note place="foot" n="51">Ashburnham House is figured in Smith's 'Additional Plates,' and in

humbler attributes of a manor. Just as completely as if
it was situated in a rural part of Wiltshire or Kent, it
has its manorial officers, its lord, its steward, its bailiff:

corporation, nor cathedral. It stands alone too among

<p>IN tracing the gradual disintegration of the great
parish of which I spoke in the last chapter, it would be
very satisfactory if we could pursue a strictly chronological method. But no such method is possible. There
are great blanks and chasms in the records. It is likely
that St. Clement Danes is as old as St. Bride's or St.
Dunstan's, but we have no proof of the fact. St. Martin's-
in-the-Fields first appears on the page of history as the
chapel of a hamlet of St. Margaret's, but the others are
full-fledged parish churches as soon as we hear of them.
Of the various precincts, the Rolls, the Inns, and the
Savoy, we have some historical information.<note place="foot" n="1">I have perhaps devoted too much attention to what may be called the
theoretical as opposed to the strictly topographical part of this chapter:
but while there are innumerable books about the one, no intelligible
account of the early state of the district has hitherto, so far as I know, been
published.</note> Of the
later and more modern parishes of St. James, St. Anne,
and St. George, the whole origin and formation is
perfectly well known, and almost within living memory.</p>
 <p> The first glimpse we obtain of a change in the great
parish of St. Margaret is afforded by a decree made in
<date value="1222">1222</date>, in which we have again a definition of boundaries.
Before we consider it, we may try to form an idea of the
eastern part of the parish before that date. It extended,
as we read in the last chapter, to the <soCalled>London Fen,</soCalled> by
which expression all authorities are agreed that the Fleet



      <pb n="69" id="p.69"/>

river is intended. But it must be something more than
the Fleet. The word <soCalled>fen</soCalled> implies a wider tract than
that actually occupied by the stream. In <date value="951">951</date> there had
probably been little change in the geography of this part
of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> since the time of the Romans. We know
nothing of a gate at Ludgate. We do know of a gate at
Newgate and of a <soCalled>broad military road</soCalled> from it. I have
already mentioned the difficulty presented by the name
of <placeName key="Ludgate">Ludgate</placeName>. Some have endeavoured to connect it with
the meeting of the folkmote within it: but that would
make it <soCalled>Leetgate,</soCalled> or <soCalled>Ledgate,</soCalled> not Ludgate. The
difficulty of deriving it from the Fleet or Flood is equally
great-indeed, an eminent authority whom I have consulted, considers such a derivation <quote>philologically impossible.</quote> I am driven, therefore, strange as it may
seem, to fall back upon king Lud. If we ask when the
legendary history of the ancient kings, Lud and Belin
and so on, first became popular, we find it was just in
this very interval of which I have been speaking, namely,
between the end of the tenth century and the end of the
twelfth. I have already said that <placeName key="Billingsgate">Billingsgate</placeName> points to
the name of a Saxon family. The people of the eleventh
century had forgotten this. The easternmost watergate
was naturally assigned therefore to the mythical Belin,
and almost as naturally, it was argued, if such a process
can be called argument, that if the eastern watergate
belonged to Belin, the western one must belong to Lud.
I have no means of knowing whether there was any gate
here before that time: a small postern may have opened
on the steep bank: on the whole I should be inclined to
reject even this but for the probability that the outer
slope was a Roman military burial place, a reason by no
means conclusive.</p>
   <p>Before the twelfth century, however, the Fen began to







<pb n="70" id="p.70"/>

be dried up. A piece of foreshore extending from the
river half-way up the slope towards what is now called
Temple Bar began to appear, and the city took possession
of it, opened the <soCalled>Ludgate,</soCalled> and eventually made a
bridge to reach it. The abbot naturally objected. A
compromise left the abbot the advowson of the new
church of St. Bride, but gave up the new colony otherwise to the city, and before the beginning of the thirteenth
century the aldermanry, we might almost say the manor,
of Joce Fitz Peter,<note place="foot" n="2">See above, chap. vi.</note> was formed, and eventually became
part of the ward of Farringdon Without. It has been
suggested that the three hides held from the abbot by
Bainiard at the time of the Domesday Survey were
situated here.  It is very possible, and we know that
they cannot have been at Bayswater, where they are
usually placed, because the land there did not belong to
the abbot till some years later. <note place="foot" n="3">See above, chap. xvi.</note></p>
 <p> Meanwhile another invasion of the abbot's land had
taken place. The highest ground on the road between
<placeName key="Ludgate">Ludgate</placeName> and St. Mary le Strand is still just outside
Temple Bar. Here a ridge or spur of the great central
hill of Rugmere,<note place="foot" n="4">See below, chap. xxi.</note> came down towards the Thames. On
its eastern side was a little brook, marked still by the
name of Milford Lane. At its extremity, on a kind of
promontory, long marked by a landing-stage known as
the Strand Bridge, were the remains of some Roman
buildings of which the masonry of a cistern or bath may
still be recognised. These remains are the more interesting because, with the pavement discovered last
year in Westminster Abbey, they are the only traces of
Roman occupation yet found in the parish. On the hill
above the Roman bath was the parish church of St.







                  <pb n="71" id="p.71"/>

Clement, called <soCalled>Danes,</soCalled> either, it is said, on account of
the settlement here of a colony of christianised invaders
under Sweyn and Canute, or on account of the number
of Danes, including Harold Harefoot, who were buried
in it. Stow reports a tradition that some marauders
were slain here on their way home to Denmark with
their booty. No doubt, detached companies of Danes
were intercepted and slain in several places; and colonies
of their nation existed all over the country. The churches
of St. Olave and of St. Magnus-perhaps the church of
St. Bride-are evidences of their strength in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.
The mere irruption, so to speak, of this parish, into St.
Margaret's is significant. The Danish soldiers came
along the old Roman war path, the <soCalled>Heere Street,</soCalled> and
poured down from it wherever the firmer ground of a
grassy knoll enabled them to reach the Thames and
their boats without risk of entanglement among the fens
which surrounded the city walls. The little creek and
promontory by the Roman bath added to the attractions
of the situation. The Aldwych Road-which still as
Wych Street survives-may in its name contain an
allusion to the ancient settlement, and certainly points
the way by which the colonists, whether Roman or
Saxon, or Dane, swept down from the ridge to the river.
The church is in what was originally the south-eastern
corner of the parish which stretches northward to the
still open Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and westward to the
crowded purlieus of Drury Lane. Two outlying districts
may mark the settlements of isolated families. One of
them is now occupied by the Lyceum Theatre,<note place="foot" n="5">Perhaps some historian of the future may hazard the opinion that the
name of St. Clement <soCalled>Danes</soCalled> refers to the long run of Hamlet at this
theatre. I have had to notice and refute much wilder guesses than this.
It would not be so absurd to hint that <soCalled>Danes</soCalled> is a reference to the
dene or hollow by Milford Lane.</note> the

other on the site of Beaufort House, once the residence
of the scientific marquis of Worcester, whose 'Century of
Inventions,' printed in <date value="1663">1663</date>, contains the germ of the
steam engine, is recognised in Beaufort Buildings.</p>
<p>The decree of <date value="1222">1222</date> formally deprived the abbot of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> of this parish.  The boundary line no
longer runs to the <quote>old stock of St. Andrew's church</quote>
and down the fen to the Thames. It stops at the garden
of St. Giles's Hospital, turns south-eastward, and reaches
the Strand near the <soCalled>church of the Innocents</soCalled> at the
house of one Simon, a weaver.<note place="foot" n="6">See ' Archaeologia,' xxvi. 227.</note> It does not even touch
the Thames. The south side of the Strand is excluded,
for a reason which will be apparent further on, and the
boundary returns along the king's highway to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.  We have here, then, already, mention of
another church, and a few lines further on there is a
third.  St. Clement Danes, St. Mary-le-Strand, then
called the Holy Innocents, and St. Martin's-away in
the open fields by Charing-were all in existence, and
St. Margaret's was rapidly dwindling.</p>
<p>  It is common for people who do not know the facts of
the case to throw blame upon the city authorities for not
extending their <soCalled>wards without,</soCalled> so as gradually to take
in what is now so often called the metropolitan area. I
do not know that the city ever wished to do this. But
it is quite easy to see that it could not have been done,
and I have given special prominence to this matter of
the archbishop's decree of <date value="1222">1222</date>, because it shows that
the lords of manors, not the mayor and commonalty,
prevented the extension of the ward system. To make
Joce Fitz Peter alderman of that part of Farringdon
Without which is comprised in the district west of the
Fleet, and Anketel de Auvergne after him, was distinctly








             <pb n="73" id="p.73"/>

to invade the rights of the lord of the manor, the abbot
of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. In the same way it was not, as we
have seen, till the reign of queen Mary that Southwark
became a ward without, though in this case it is known
that the city ardently desired further jurisdiction, and
had begun to take steps more than a century before to
that end.  But we shall see presently that even on
<placeName key="Holborn Hill">Holborn Hill</placeName> the city jurisdiction was disputed, and we
can have no doubt that every ward without was keenly
fought over; while the device of taking a lease from the
lord of the manor had to be resorted to in one case, that
of Finsbury.<note place="foot" n="7">See chap. vii., p. 207.</note></p>
<p> In addition to the new parishes carved out of St.
Margaret's, some extra-parochial "precincts" had also
arisen. When the Blackfriars had laboriously pieced
together an estate at the north-western corner of the
new ward of Joce Fitz Peter, the munificence of certain
eminent citizens and the favour of the king<note place="foot" n="8">Chap. viii.</note>enabled
them to migrate to the spot which has ever since borne
their name. The older house, with its gardens, passed
into the possession of Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln, "a
person well affected to the study of the laws,"<note place="foot" n="9">Herbert's 'Inns of Court,' p. 289.</note> and he
granted it, before his death in <date value="1310">1310</date>, we know not on
what terms, to the legal students and professors. They
soon by renewable leases obtained virtual possession of
the adjoining mansion of the bishop of Chichester; and
forced the bishop to remove certain bars at the foot of
<soCalled>Chancellor's Lane,</soCalled> now Chancery Lane, which Sir
John le Breton, during one of his wardenships<note place="foot" n="10">See above, chap. vi.</note> of the
city, had allowed to be set up on account of the constant
passage of traffic and the consequently muddy state
of the lane.  The chief buildings were erected from







<pb n="74" id="p.74"/>

bricks made in what had been the bishop's <soCalled>coney
garth,</soCalled> the western part of the garden, now almost
surrounded by houses.   Before the reign of Henry VIII.
the society flourished exceedingly, and reckoned among
its members many eminent men, including Sir <persName key="More, Thomas">Thomas
More</persName>. A little later, according to Fuller, <persName key="Jonson, Ben">Ben Jonson</persName>
worked at the buildings, <quote>when having a trowel in one
hand, he had a book in the other,</quote> and it may very well
be that he pursued his occupation under the orders of
<persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName>, who built a curious, but thoroughly gothic
chapel on tall arches, which was consecrated in <date value="1623">1623</date>.<note place="foot" n="11">It might have been hoped that such a sacred conjunction would have
ensured the safety of this chapel: but as I write it is being added to and
altered, and that, incredible as it may seem, under the direction, not of an
architect, but of a lawyer. An architect would probably have thought
himself unworthy to touch the work of Jones, though at Cambridge Scott
<soCalled>improved</soCalled> the work of <persName key="Wren, Christopher">Wren</persName>.</note></p>
<p>  Of all the buildings at Lincoln's Inn, the gateway, now
that the chapel has been historically-speaking destroyed,
is the most interesting: being late gothic work, somewhat like St. John's Gate and some parts of St. James's
Palace. Naturally, it is very obnoxious to improvers,
and is even now, it is reported, under condemnation.
The new hall,<note place="foot" n="12">There is an account of it in Spilsbury's ' Lincoln's Inn,' p. 88.</note> situated in the northern part of the old
<soCalled>Coney garth,</soCalled> is very conspicuous from Lincoln's-Inn-
Fields, and is one of the first buildings made under the
influence of the gothic revival which can be pronounced
a success. The architect was chosen according to the
usual English method. Having, we are informed, <quote>given
evidence of talents of a superior order in the erection of
the noble Doric propylaeum at the railway terminus in
Euston Square,</quote> he was selected as a fit and proper
person to erect a hall which was to be as like a piece of
genuine Tudor architecture as it could be made. Philip

Hardwick showed a versatility denied on similar occasions to Barry and to Scott, and abandoning the Grecian
style erected in red banded brick the very handsome
new hall, on which his initials and the date <date value="1843">1843</date>, prevent
the visitor from falling into error.</p>
  <p>The smaller inns are almost too numerous to mention:
yet I would like to pause a moment over the smallest.
Barnard's Inn, <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, is entered from the street by a
narrow doorway, and the visitor immediately and without
notice finds himself transported into another century,
and sees what might be the actual scenery of one of De
Hooghe's pictures.<note place="foot" n="13">There is a good view in Herbert, p. 349.</note> Very similar, but on a larger scale,
was the old Furnival's Inn, the design of which was
reasonably attributed to <placeName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</placeName>.<note place="foot" n="14">See views in Wilkinson, ii. 15; Herbert, p. 324, &amp;c.; and Ireland's
'Picturesque Views,' p. 163.</note> But it has long
perished. There is much to admire in Staples Inn, and
there is a refreshment in plunging into its quiet courts
from the din and bustle of Holborn Bars, which the tired
Londoner can best enjoy. In the whole of this quarter,
from Fetter Lane westward to Chancery Lane, and from
<placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName> to the Rolls, an observant saunterer will find
innumerable fragments of ancient glory. Sometimes it is
only a heavy cornice. Sometimes it is a red brick pilaster.
Sometimes it is only a <soCalled>shell</soCalled> hall-door. But such relics
are rapidly disappearing before the improving hands of
connoisseur treasurers: and one mentions them almost
with bated breath.<note place="foot" n="15">See chap. viii. for brief notices of the Temple and the Rolls.</note>
</p>  <p>Most of these institutions, however small, have at one
period or another claimed exemption from parochial
rates. Some of these claims have been successful. In
others the parish has triumphed. These exemptions

found to be neither in <placeName key="London">London</placeName> nor in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, but in the Rolls, and

It was early known as Fickett's Field, and by its side close
to the city boundary there was a blacksmith's, possibly
an armourer's shop.  Fickett's Field was the jousting
ground of the Templars, and the forge was, no doubt,
fully employed for shoeing horses and riveting mail.
But the knights and their days passed away.        The city
took particular interest in this corner of its dominions.
The boundary was somewhat indefinite and unprotected.
The Inns of Court were a constant cause of strife as to
jurisdiction, and so the forge, lest it should fall into other
hands, was rented of the king, and is rented still, though
the building, whatever it was, disappeared in the blaze of

Wat Tyler's rebellion. Year by year, when the sheriffs
went to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> to be presented at the court of
exchequer, six horseshoes and <quote>sixty-one nails, good

county of Middlesex.</quote>   Within the past year the law
courts have themselves migrated from   <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> to
the new buildings provided for them, and, for aught we
can tell to the contrary, the court of exchequer, or what
answers to it now, may actually sit on this very site.<note place="foot" n="18">In accordance with an act termed <title>The Queen's Remembrancer's

palace of justice, the most complete result, in these kingdoms, at least, of the movement known as the gothic
revival-a movement which has, on the whole, been
wonderfully barren of fine buildings, and chiefly distinguished by the destruction of vestiges of antiquity under
the false name of restoration. A survey of the main
characteristics of the new law courts brings out two
principal facts; one is that the architect's design was
pruned by the authorities in a manner which would
have ruined anything less meritorious; and the other,
that lopped and limited as it is, we have here a building
worthy of the nation.</p>
  <p>The new law courts stand partially within the city
boundary, a fact which renders it possible to transfer
business to them  from  the Guildhall as well as from
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</p>







<pb n="78" id="p.78"/>
<p>  The Strand front in the original design was to have
had a record tower, which, as the design is in existence, may yet possibly be built and which would have
formed a very conspicuous and ornamental feature of the
entrance to the city.  This and many other parts of Mr.
Street's  original drawing were removed by superior
authority, while the architect himself was wearied by contradictory orders, and by changes of site; for one minister
was anxious to place the new building on the embankment and had a design prepared with that intention. In
<date value="1871">1871</date>, however, all obstacles were      removed, and the
ground of Fickett's Field was cleared.    The front is 290
feet in width, its central feature being the gable of the
great hall, 140 feet in height.  This is recessed from the
line of the roadway some 80 feet, a staircase turret being
on either side. The hall is superior to that of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> in one respect for it is vaulted with stone.  It is
230 feet in length, and only 48 in width, so that the
appearance of length is greatly enhanced.  There are
sixteen windows at the sides, each 36 feet high. The
eighteen courts all open from the hall.  It is greatly to
be regretted that when her majesty, in December <date value="1882">1882</date>,
opened this magnificent building, the artist who had conceived it was no more.<note place="foot" n="20">I remember on one occasion standing with Mr. Street on the site of
the porch, before a single stone had been laid. I asked him if he could see
the building in his mind's eye. He said he could, distinctly : and pointing
to a tall house on the opposite side of the Strand, he added, <quote>That building
is fifty-four feet high.</quote> Then he turned round, and looked up in the air,
<quote>My gable is more than twice as high.</quote> The anecdote is trivial but shows
how clearly he had thought the matter out. I have no doubt he could
have directed the building without any drawn design, as Wren directed
St. Paul's.</note></p>
  <p>I have mentioned in passing the parish of St. Mary, or
the Holy Innocents, which in <date value="1222">1222</date> had already been
severed from <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.  It lay for the most part on








            <pb n="79" id="p.79"/>

the south side of the Strand, and comprised a small part
of the manor of the Savoy-that part namely, which was
outside the immediate precincts of the duke of Lancaster's palace. It is perhaps hardly correct to say that
St. Mary's was taken out of St. Margaret's. It would be
more correct to describe it as taken out of the Thames.
The Savoy was put together by degrees, but the main
part of it, there can be no doubt, was at some remote time
foreshore.  Remote as it was, that time may be fixed
within certain limits. The Strand, and consequently the
southern side of it, with its steep little lanes leading down
to the water's edge, did not exist in <date value="971">971</date>.  In the decree
of <date value="1222">1222</date> the church is mentioned; and in <date value="1246">1246</date>, Henry III.
made a grant of the land lying between <soCalled><foreign lang="FR">la Strande</foreign></soCalled> and
the river's edge, to his wife's uncle, Peter of Savoy. The
boundaries of the estate which comprised the parish of
the Holy Innocents, were defined a little later. <quote>To
understand them now we must remember that west of
Wych Street, then or soon afterwards known as the old
Wych Road or Ald Wych Road, there was an open green
with a maypole, and just beyond it a cemetery, which
lay rather below the level of the present line of street, and
on a part of the site now occupied by Somerset House.</quote><note place="foot" n="21">'Memorials of the Savoy,' p. 11, to which I must refer for a more
complete account of the district.</note>
The Innocents' church was very near the present chapel
of King's College.  It was eventually destroyed by
the protector Somerset, to make way for his new
palace, and the rapidly increasing population of the
parish was left absolutely without any place of worship,
After some delay the chapel of St. John in the Savoy
was assigned to them, on certain terms, and it was
not until <date value="1717">1717</date>, when their new church in the Strand
was built, that they ceased to be thus dependent.







<pb n="80" id="p.80"/>

It was owing to their tenancy that the chapel, now a
chapel royal, became commonly known as St. Mary's.
The parishioners brought with them their old church bell,
and took it away again when they left; and there is no
bell in the chapel tower to this day.</p>
<p>  The artificial nature of the manor is apparent from the
map,<note place="foot" n="22">Memorials, p. 230.</note> for instead of being in any way conterminous with
a parish it is partly in St. Clement's and partly in St.
Mary's, resembling in this respect a city ward.<note place="foot" n="23">See Appendix E.</note> It was
in fact made up by purchase as well as by the exercise
of the king's not very scrupulous authority. By the
bequest of Peter, the first owner, it went to the friars
of Mountjoy, who sold it to queen Eleanor for 300
marks. She granted it in <date value="1284">1284</date> to her son Edmund, earl
of Lancaster, and it went eventually to the first wife
of John of Gaunt, who was created duke of Lancaster. His son settled the whole of the estates of
the duchy on the Sovereign for the time being: and
the manor of the Savoy is still the property of her
majesty.</p>
<p>  The house was burnt by Wat Tyler's followers, and
never rebuilt: and the ground was made over by Henry
VIII. to a hospital founded under his father's will and
completed in <date value="1517">1517</date>. But it never prospered. The estates
were given away by Edward VI. to Bridewell, resumed
by queen Mary, and finally frittered away by carelessness and mismanagement, until, in <date value="1702">1702</date>, lord keeper
Wright, by what authority I know not, dissolved and suppressed it finally. George III. made the chapel <soCalled>royal,</soCalled>
and it has been kept in good repair, a fire in <date value="1864">1864</date>, by
which the old roof was destroyed, having led to its
thorough and satisfactory restoration. It is interesting
apart from its associations as the only old church between




            <pb n="81" id="p.81"/>

St. Margaret's and St. Olave's, Hart Street, with the
exception of the renovated chapel of the Temple.</p>
<p>  St. Mary-le-Strand is one of the prettiest of Gibbs's
works. It is wholly wanting in dignity, and we cannot
but wish the tower had been to one side, as it presents an
extremely formal appearance facing the street. It has,
of course, been objected to the design of the church that
seeming outside to consist of two storeys, there is but one
within: an objection which applies equally to Whitehall
chapel and many other buildings in the style, including
St. Paul's.</p>
<p>  The front of Somerset House has been admired by
many good judges of architecture. It is in part a copy
of the old building which was designed by Inigo Jones:
but both here, and on the south front towards Lancaster
place, the effect is much marred by two storeys of windows
showing through one order of columns or pilasters. Every
one must agree that the river front is not quite worthy
of its conspicuous situation.  Sir William  Chambers
was not equal to the task he undertook. The almost
adjoining Adelphi, called after the brothers Adam, is
much better, though by no means so magnificent either
in size or costliness. The <soCalled>dark arches</soCalled> of the Adelphi
mark the site of old streets, some of which remain near
them but at a lower level than that of Salisbury Street
and Adam Street.</p>
<p>  There is no part of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> in which the local names are
more significant than the Strand. They tell of the former
existence of a row of river-side palaces, of which Somerset House only can be said in any sense to remain, and
of which the Savoy chapel is the only contemporary relic.
At first the great houses belonged to bishops. Nine are
said to have lived in the Strand at one time, but very few
are commemorated by street names. The Outer Temple







<pb n="82" id="p.82"/>

was in the reign of Elizabeth the town house of the earl
of Essex, and both Devereux Court, and Essex Street
remain. But previously it had been the house, or one of
the houses of the bishop of Exeter.<note place="foot" n="24">See above, chap. ix. Bishop Stapleton seems to have had two town
houses, one here and one in Old Dean's Lane, now Warwick Lane,
Newgate.</note> The adjoining site
was occupied by the bishops of Bath, whose rights were
usurped by Seymour, the brother of the protector Somerset.  At his tragical death, Henry Fitz Alan, earl of
Arundel, bought it for &#x00A3;41 6s. 8d., and in <date value="1579">1579</date> it devolved
on the Howard family, and the land has belonged, like
Arundel Castle itself, to the dukes of Norfolk ever since.
Their name and titles define the locality of their estate.
The vast area of Somerset House covers the site of the
residences of the bishops of Chester and of Worcester, as
well as of the church and churchyard already mentioned,
while the wall of the south front, but very little more, is
in the precinct of the Savoy. The site of Beaufort
House has already been noticed. Here the bishops
of Carlisle had a house, spoken of in some of the documents connected with the Savoy, which is described as
lying between the houses of this bishop, to the westward,
and of the bishop of Worcester to the eastward. The
bishops of Llandaff also lived in the Strand and on the
Savoy estate, but I have failed to identify the place with
certainty. It may have been the small plot on the north
side which is now marked by Exeter Hall, and by
Burleigh Street, where the great lord Burleigh lived in
the reign of James I. It was close to the house of the
junior branch of the Cecil family, and Cecil Street with
Salisbury Street are on the ground, which still belongs to
lord Salisbury. The houses at the lower end of Salisbury
Street were built and decorated by Payne or the Adams,

              <pb n="83" id="p.83"/>

and some of the most charming rooms in <placeName key="London">London</placeName> are in
the last house on the right-hand side, now an hotel. This
street is supported like the adjacent Adelphi on arches,
and a miserable village of tumble-down houses remains
between it and the Embankment gardens, at a lower
level.  The boundary   between the Savoy and     St.
Martin's passes down the centre of Cecil Street. Before
houses covered the spot a little brook ran here into the
Thames, and no doubt marked the boundary. The roadway of the Strand crossed it by the Ivy Bridge.<note place="foot" n="25">Described as Ulebrig in some of the Savoy records. " Ule" is Anglo-Saxon for "owl," which in itself tells a tale of the rural state of the

<p>  Of the ancient connection of the convent of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> with this part of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> the most prominent
modern evidence is afforded by the land on the slope
north of the manor of the Savoy. Here a large district
is still known as Covent Garden.<note place="foot" n="26">There was another Covent Garden at Bishopsgate, probably that of
St. Helen's priory.</note> Long Acre was once

smallest in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, lies between Long Acre and the
Strand.  The church of St. Paul is often, but rather
vaguely said to have been the earliest specially built for
Protestant worship.  The parish was divided from St.
Martin's by the first act of a local nature passed after the
accession of Charles II. The whole parish belonged to
the Russell family, having been granted in <date value="1552">1552</date> to John,
earl of Bedford, whose descendant the duke of Bedford
owns it now.   Southampton Street marks the site of
their house of residence, but until it was built they had
the old house of the bishop of Carlisle, at the opposite
side of the Strand, adjoining the Savoy. Francis, fourth

earl, laid out <date value="4500">4500</date>&#x00A3;. in building the church, and is
said<note place="foot" n="27">By <persName key="Walpole, Horace">Horace Walpole</persName>: see Cunningham, ii. 638.</note> to have told <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName> he wished for nothing
<quote>much better than a barn.</quote>  <quote>Well then,</quote> said Jones,
<quote>you shall have the handsomest barn in the world.</quote>
The church was of brick with a tiled roof, and must have
differed much in appearance from the present church,
which was built by Hardwick, after a fire in <date value="1795">1795</date>. The
general lines of the old design were followed, and with
the help of a little imagination we can realise its original
features.<note place="foot" n="28">There is a very complete account of both parish and church in Britton
 and Pugin's 'Edifices,' i. 107, written by E. W. Brayley.</note>  <quote>It is built in the Tuscan order as described
by Vitruvius,</quote> says Brayley, who adds that <quote>it may be
regarded as the most complete specimen of that order in
the world, as no ancient building of the kind is now
remaining.</quote> The portico faces the flower market, and
is one of the best known features of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>: and it has
often been cited as an example of the fact <quote>that it is
taste and not expense, which is the parent of beauty.</quote>
The knowledge, or genius, or calculation by which Jones
contrived even in such a plain building to obtain a
picturesque effect is certainly a strong proof of the folly
of architects who imagine that any amount of showy
carving, or granite columns, will form a substitute for the
study of proportion and the expenditure, not of money,
but of thought. The rest of the square was also originally designed by Jones, of whose work but slight traces
remain. He lived it is said close by in Chandos Street,
and a modernised house there has still portions of a
magnificently carved staircase which may well have been
designed by him.</p>
<p>   I have abandoned for a moment the chronological
 arrangement in order to place Covent Garden in its




                  <pb n="85" id="p.85"/>

topographical position with respect to the Strand. St.
Paul's, as I have said, was taken out of St. Martin's. We
have now to see how it was that the ground was in St.
Martin's and not in St. Margaret's. When, in the oft-
mentioned year <date value="1222">1222</date>, the archbishop pronounced his
award in the matter of the <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> boundaries, he
specially excepted a church and cemetery of St. Martin.<note place="foot" n="29">'St. Martin's in the Fields,' by W. G. Humphry, B.D., vicar of the
parish.</note>
No parish appears to have been attached to it. A
century later a vicar is mentioned. Before the end of
the fourteenth century <quote>the parish of St. Martin-in-the-
Fields is described by name as being in the franchise of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</quote> It is not easy to decide what were its
boundaries at this period, but it probably included what
are now the separate parishes of St. James and St.
George, while St. Anne, Soho, remained to St. Margaret's.
When Henry VIII. had annexed St. James's Park to his
new palace,<note place="foot" n="30">See next chapter.</note> he issued a patent, dated in <date value="1542">1542</date>, by which
he transferred to St. Martin's all the district which
remained to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> north and west of Whitehall.<note place="foot" n="31">This royal decree was read at the trial about the rates of St. Margaret's
in <date value="1833">1833</date>, reported by Walsh and printed by Nicholls in <date value="1834">1834</date>.</note>
He found it inconvenient that funerals should pass
through the palace to the churchyard of St. Margaret's.
Thenceforth a line was drawn at the northern gate of
<placeName key="Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>, and only what lay to the south of it was to be
included in St. Margaret's. Thus the old parish was
once more diminished, but St. Martin's remains, like
St. Clement's, and the other divisions, part of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> as respects parliamentary elections. In <date value="1680">1680</date> it
was considered <quote>the greatest cure in England,</quote> and
Richard Baxter is reported to have complained that it






<pb n="86" id="p.86"/>

contained forty thousand people more than could be
accommodated in its church. In <date value="1684">1684</date> St. James's, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>-which we generally style St. James's, <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>,
-was taken out of it. Four years later St. Anne's,
Soho, was also separated, and when in <date value="1725">1725</date> Sir Richard
Grosvenor built his new quarter about Grosvenor Square,
St. George's was also divided from it.</p>
<p>  St. Martin's may be looked upon as the centre of
modern London. Charing Cross is in the parish, in fact
one of the earliest notices of the church describes it as
<quote>juxta Charring</quote>; this was in the reign of Edward I.,
who having been informed that treasure was buried in
St. Martin's desired a search to be made for it. The
result is unknown.<note place="foot" n="32">Humphry, p. 10. This mention of <soCalled>Charring</soCalled> is the more interesting
as this was the king who erected the cross. It is one of the three <soCalled>ings</soCalled>

<p>  The site of the Eleanor Cross is marked by Le Soeur's

 and the king's mews behind. On the south side stood
 Northumberland House, destroyed without much reason,
 but at an enormous cost, in <date value="1874">1874</date>, the last of the great
 riverside palaces.  York House, which had been just
 within the parish boundary, and next to Salisbury House,
 was the residence of those archbishops of York who succeeded Wolsey, having been bought for them, instead of an
 inconvenient house in <placeName key="Southwark">Southwark</placeName>, given by queen Mary.
 But only one archbishop seems to have actually lived in
 it, Heath, the first who held it, and who was Mary's
 chancellor. It became a kind of official residence for
 chancellors, several of whom, and keepers of the great
 seal, rented it successively,<note place="foot" n="34">Cunningham enumerates the lord keeper Bacon; the lord chancellor Bacon, his son; the lord keeper Pickering; and the lord chancellor
 Egerton.</note> and here the great <persName key="Bacon, Francis">Francis

<p> Gibbs has gained more fame by St. Martin's church
 than by any other building he erected.   It has one
 serious fault at least. The steeple rises from the portico,
 which, massive as it is, appears crushed in consequence.







<pb n="88" id="p.88"/>

The interior, which is very closely imitated in its chief
features from Wren's St. James's, is extremely fine, and
in spite of large galleries gives the visitor an impression
of space very unusual in a <placeName key="London">London</placeName> church. It has been
well observed<note place="foot" n="36">Gwilt in ' Edifices,' i. 44.</note> that neither Gibbs nor his contemporary
Hawksmoor understood the value of the mathematical
proportion so much insisted upon by Wren. One consequence is here very apparent, for the east end, although
it resembles more than one of Sir Christopher's, is yet a
failure, heavy and dull, only for want of better proportions. To prove this we have only to remember St.
Lawrence, Jewry. The portico is magnificent, and its
splendid effect is set off to great advantage by the meanness of the neighbouring National Gallery. The church
was consecrated in <date value="1726">1726</date>, having cost the parishioners
more than 36,000&#x00A3;.  We can imagine Sir <persName key="Wren, Christopher">Christopher
Wren</persName>, who was still alive, looking on and thinking what
he might have done with such a sum of money at St.
Stephen's or St. Mary-le-Bow, in the city, or at St.
James's, in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>.</p>
<p>  Of the National Gallery as a building, the less said is
the better.<note place="foot" n="37">I have waded through an appalling pile of pamphlets on the subject,
without much result.</note>  It is impossible to regard it as permanent.
A time must come when we shall be ashamed to see it
any longer. It was unfortunate for Wilkins that he was
chosen to design it. His powers as an architect were
remarkable. His design for the University of London
in Gower Street has been only partially carried out, but
we can judge of him by St. George's Hall, at Liverpool,
one of the most beautiful modern buildings in Europe.
At Trafalgar Square he was crippled by conditions incompatible with the possibility of doing anything good.








             <pb n="89" id="p.89"/>

"The money allotted to the purpose was scarcely one-half of what was necessary; he was ordered to take and
use the pillars of the portico of Carlton House; to set
back the wings so as not to hide St. Martin's church;
and lastly to allow two thoroughfares through it."<note place="foot" n="38">Fergusson, ' Modern Architecture,' 304.</note>  No
wonder, then, that it is a miserable performance; and
poor Wilkins, who could have done so much better and
knew it, died of the ridicule his work excited.</p>
<p>  If Englishmen have cause to feel ashamed of the
exterior of the National Gallery, which has not been
improved of late years by some incongruous additions,
they have every reason to be proud of its contents. The
rate of acquisition is amazing. It goes on by leaps and
bounds. The number of pictures has doubled in twenty
years, and much more than doubled in value. In the
very beginnings of things we bought the Angerstein
collection, consisting of thirty-eight pictures, several of
them very poor, especially those which bore the greatest
names, for 57,000&#x00A3;., and lodged them in a house now
absorbed by the War Office in Pall Mall. That was in
<date value="1824">1824</date>. Ten years later the first trustees were appointed,
and six years were spent in the usual recriminations in
which we always indulge on these occasions, and in
building in Trafalgar Square. The number of pictures
had meanwhile risen, partly by purchases, partly by the
munificent gift of Sir George Beaumont, partly by
bequests, to one hundred and sixty-six. Progress was
slow till <date value="1843">1843</date>, when only twenty more pictures had been
added, but a few years later the Vernon collection was
bequeathed, and doubled the numbers, or would have
done so had it been possible to receive the new pictures
in the old gallery. They were exhibited first at Marlborough House, and afterwards for many years at South








<pb n="90" id="p.90"/>

<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>. In <date value="1856">1856</date> Turner's paintings and water-colour
sketches were bequeathed. Ten years later the number
of works exhibited amounted to 750, and the purchase
of the Garvagh Raffaelle for 9000&#x00A3;. was thought to have
exhausted the buying power of the trustees for some
time to come. But a much more astonishing, if scarcely
so satisfactory a bargain was completed in <date value="1866">1866</date>, when we
gave 7000&#x00A3;. for the very doubtful picture of "Christ
Blessing Little Children," attributed to Rembrandt.
Sir Charles Eastlake's early Italian pictures were added
in the following year, under an old arrangement; but
very little else was bought until the autumn of <date value="1868">1868</date>,
when we acquired one of the most remarkable works in
the gallery. We already possessed, as the best picture
in the Angerstein Collection, the magnificent Sebastian
del Piombo of the "Raising of Lazarus," for which
Michael Angelo is known to have made the design, and
on which he probably worked himself. But the new
purchase professed to be an actual <soCalled>holograph,</soCalled> so to
speak, of the great Florentine-unfinished, it is true, but
complete in composition, and most instructive in every
way. At first there was no space to hang this treasure
of art, and it was not exhibited publicly till the critics,
and many besides, had seen it in private. The doubtful
Rembrandt had a good pedigree, or it could never have
fetched 7000&#x00A3;.; the undoubted Michael Angelo had
comparatively no pedigree, and was only reckoned
worth 2000&#x00A3;., but the popular verdict leaves little
question as to which of the two is best worth the higher
sum. In <date value="1869">1869</date> the National Gallery obtained the old
rooms of the Royal Academy at the southern end of the
building, and signalised the occasion by the purchase of
De Hooge's "Courtyard in Holland" for 1722&#x00A3;., a price
which no one grudged when once the picture had been








            <pb n="91" id="p.91"/>

seen, and by reclaiming, after some delay, the Vernon
bequest from South Kensington. Many people, however, did grudge the purchase in the following year of the
Peel Gallery, as it gave us only a few new names, and
added but little to the completeness of the Collection.
But many of the Dutch pictures it contained were
masterpieces in their way. The "Avenue at Middelharnis " by Hobbema, and the "Velvet Hat" by Rubens,
became popular favourites at once. The Peel Gallery
consisted of seventy-seven pictures and some drawings,
and the price came to nearly a thousand guineas each, a
high average; but five years later we received a still
larger number of fine works for nothing by the bequest
of Mr. Wynn Ellis. His pictures do not reach the same
high average as those of Sir Robert Peel, and some of
the best had no pedigrees; but the strange Van Romerswale-at first attributed to Quentin Matsys, till the true
artist's name was found inscribed on one of the parchments represented-and some landscapes by Claude,
Ruysdael, and De Koninck, are a distinct gain. They
were among the new pictures exhibited when the public
were first admitted to the galleries built by Mr. Barry
behind the eastern end of the old front. As at the first
foundation of the building, much controversy among
artists and architects preceded the completion of this
great improvement; and, though few were enthusiastic
as to the beauty of the new galleries, all were astonished
at the rapidity with which they were filled, and at the
enhanced value of pictures properly arranged and lighted,
and hung where they were visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>   During the last few years many excellent works have
been obtained by purchase. Lord Beaconsfield took a
keen interest in the improvement of the collection, and
several fine early Italian works were added during his







<pb n="92" id="p.92"/>

premiership. But Mr. Gladstone's government has not
been far behind, and during the past year the sale of the
Hamilton gallery gave an opportunity which was eagerly
seized. The new acquisitions, including those from
Hamilton Palace, assuredly raise our National Gallery to
a very high level indeed. We have not the Titians of
Madrid, nor the Rubenses of the Louvre; we have not
the Memlings of Bruges, nor the Van Eycks of Ghent.
But we have some of the best examples of all these
artists-Titian's "Ariosto," Rubens's "Chateau de Stein,"
Memling's "Holy Family," Van Eyck's "Arnolfini," for
example, only to name a few; we have Raffaelles,
Murillos, Solarios, Rembrandts, Hobbemas, Claudes,
and, in short, all the great masters, with one conspicuous
exception, which is, however, temporarily supplied by
the duke of Norfolk's generous loan of Holbein's
"Duchess of Milan." This was the lady of whom it is
said that when Henry VIII. proposed to marry her, she
replied that unfortunately she had only one head. That
nevertheless she dallied with the offer is apparent from
the existence in England of this picture, brought over by
Henry's ambassador, and another at Windsor Castle.<note place="foot" n="39">See Mr. Scharf's paper on the subject in 'Archeologia,' xl. 106.</note></p>
<p>  Among recent purchases are the Suffolk Leonardo
which excellent judges prefer to the repetition of the
same subject in the Louvre; examples from the Hamilton
collection of Botticelli, Velasquez, Pontormo, Signorelli,
Mantegna, and other great artists; together with the five
little pictures of a lesser genius, Gonsalez Coques, which
Mr. Burton recently obtained in Belgium. As a representative collection, therefore, the National Gallery is
second to no other; and it is impossible not to look with
pride on the successful efforts of a single generation to
form in England a museum of art such as may compare








              <pb n="93" id="p.93"/>

with any other in Europe, even with some which are the
result of long centuries of growth.</p>
<p>  At some not very distant day the barracks which
occupy so much space at the back of the gallery must
be removed, and an adequate building erected to house
our treasures. The prints and drawings by great masters,
of which we have a collection quite worthy of our pictures, should be brought and exhibited near the other
works of the same artists. Designs have been made on
several occasions, but they have never secured the
approval of the critics. The fact is we have no Wren or
Burlington, no Wilkins, not even a Gibbs among us now,
and it will be better to wait a little longer rather than
have a National Gallery in the style of the additions to
Burlington House, or the stuccoed front of Buckingham
Palace.</p>
<p>  The rapid growth of buildings in the parish gave
serious cause of uneasiness to the authorities. In <date value="1634">1634</date>
a commission was appointed which reported that a man
named Moor had built without license a row of no less
than forty-two houses close to St. Martin's church. He
was fined a thousand pounds, and the houses were pulled
down by the sheriffs. Lord Bedford had special leave
to build round <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>, but did not avail himself
of it at first, on account of the strong public feeling on
the subject, a feeling stimulated by the ravages of the
plague.<note place="foot" n="40">See above, chap. xi., and Southey's 'Common Place Book' in which
there are numerous extracts relating to the extension of building in the
suburbs.</note>  The western roads were beginning to be lined
with houses. Dwellings for the families of the officials
and menials of the court were erected in the mews, which
occupied what is now the open space of Trafalgar
Square. At the same time a number of houses were








<pb n="94" id="p.94"/>

demolished in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, by order of the committee
sitting in the Star Chamber, on the ground that they
fouled the water of the stream which, as we have seen,
crossed the road into the Green Park, and supplied

blame was thrown upon the city for refusing its freedom
even <quote>to rare artists,</quote> who were thereby driven to the
western suburbs. But <placeName key="v">London</placeName> was just recovering from
the successive shocks of the plague and the fire, overcrowding was so much dreaded that the means taken
to prevent it only added to the danger, and sanitary
science was confined to empiricism and superstitious
observances.</p>
<p>  St. James's, <placeName key="Piccadilly"></placeName>, was at last found to be a
necessity. No efforts could stop the tide of building.
Soho was already crowded and fashionable: but I
postpone a notice of it to keep if possible to the chronological order in which the <soCalled>hamlets</soCalled> of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
were separated from the mother church.<note place="foot" n="41">The history of the parish of St. James is fully detailed in Mr. Wheatley's
entertaining volume ' Round about Piccadilly and Pall Mall.'</note> The great
western road may be said to have commenced with Wych
Street, but the newly-built quarter of Covent Garden
interrupted it, and the line of highway of which Piccadilly is the chief part, only becomes direct at the eastern
end of Cranbourn Street where Long Acre and St.
Martin's Lane meet. The increase of population took
place at first about the palace of St. James's and Pall
Mall. The square was built in <date value="1665">1665</date> and at once became,
as it still continues, a centre of fashion, which has perhaps
never been so constant to any other site. <quote>Fashionable
neighbourhoods are continually changing, but this square
is an exception to the rule, as it has been for two
centuries one of the most aristocratic places in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>,</quote>








             <pb n="95" id="p.95"/>

says Mr. Wheatley.<note place="foot" n="42">P. 355.</note> The fields on which the new
quarter was laid out immediately after the restoration of
Charles II. were the leasehold property of Henry
Jermyn, earl of St. Albans, who is always supposed to
have been the second husband of queen Henrietta Maria.
The square was at first called the Piazza, and had a large
pond in the centre. The first tenants of the surrounding
houses were all people of rank except two of the king's
mistresses.<note place="foot" n="43">See lists in Cunningham, i. 440.</note>  The act of parliament by virtue of which
the parish was separated from St. Martin's, was passed in
<date value="1685">1685</date>, and the church was consecrated in July by Compton,
bishop of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.  Wren was the architect and as but
little money-only 7000&#x00A3;, at first-was forthcoming he, as
usual with him, spent as much as possible in one direction.
Wren seems to have thought it best, and there is much to
be said for his view, that in church building some part of
the structure should be made as complete as possible,
even though, through lack of funds the other parts might
suffer. He acted on this principle at St. Mary-le-Bow,
and St. Stephen's Wallbrook, as well as in many other city
churches. At St. James's he lavished all his small resources
on the interior, and succeeded in producing one of the most
beautiful, convenient and satisfactory places of worship
in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. Gibbs, in rebuilding St. Martin's, could not
improve upon the design of St. James's. Wren's own
account will show his opinions :- <quote>I can hardly think it
practicable to make a single room so capacious, with pews
and galleries, as to hold above two thousand persons, and
all to hear the service, and both to hear distinctly and see
the preacher. I endeavoured to effect this in building
the parish church of St. James, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, which I
presume is the most capacious with these qualifications
that hath yet been built; and yet at a solemn time, when




<pb n="96" id="p.96"/>

the church was much crowded, I could not discern from a
gallery that two thousand were present. In this church I
mention, though very broad, and the nave arched, yet as
there are no walls of a second order, nor lantherns, nor
buttresses, but the whole roof rests upon the pillars, as
do also the galleries; I think it may be found beautiful
and convenient, and as such the cheapest of any form I
could invent.</quote><note place="foot" n="44">'Parentalia,' p. 320, quoted by Mr. Wheatley, p. 103. I remember to

St. Stephen's Wallbrook, Wren's most successful interior.</p>
<p>  It does not come within the scope of this book to
describe in detail the interesting features of this most
interesting district.  It is a curious fact that neither St.
James's Palace nor St. James's Park is within the parish
boundary, but St. James's Street with its modern clubs
and shops, the time-worn towers of Henry VIII.'s palace
looking out on them from beyond the mists of three
hundred and fifty years; Marlborough and Schomberg
Houses, with memories alternately warlike and artistic;
Regent Street and the ingenious quadrant, or fourth part
of a circle, with which Nash connected two thoroughfares, and created one of the few architectural street
effects in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>; the tall houses of Carlton Terrace,
with the duke of York's column and glimpses of the park
and the <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> towers beyond, another happy inspiration, which like the quadrant deserved a better fate than
to be made of plaster and paint; Burlington Gardens and
Savile Row, the home till lately of classical architecture of
the best type, of which only Vardy's Uxbridge House <note place="foot" n="45">Now the western branch of the Bank of England; judiciously added
to lately. General Wade's house faced into Old Burlington Street, but is

            <pb n="97" id="p.97"/>

remains; the Albany, where at the Savile Row end and
in the topmost storey, Macaulay wrote the main part of
his 'History'; all these things and more might well detain
my pen.   But many books have been written about
them and I could add nothing to make it worth
while to pause in the task of tracing the history of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</p>
<p>  As early as <date value="1675">1675</date> it had been found necessary by the
authorities of St. Martin's to make special arrangements
for the collection of their rates in Soho, a district the name
of which, like that of Piccadilly, is involved in obscurity.
Piccadilly may be derived from the name of a house
of entertainment nearly on the site of the modern
Criterion: but this is only putting the difficulty a step
further back. Pimlico, another strange name in the
parish of St. Margaret, may be accounted for by the
existence of a similarly named place in the West Indies,
whence timber was imported. But Soho has entirely
baffled inquirers. Cunningham quotes the rate books of
St. Martin's to show that in <date value="1636">1636</date> people were living <quote>at
the brick kilns near Sohoe.</quote> In <date value="1660">1660</date> this spelling is
reversed in the parish register, where the burial is recorded
of a <quote>child from Soeho.</quote></p>
<p>  Although a church on the site of St. Ann's was in
existence as a chapel of ease from <date value="1679">1679</date> it was not until
the beginning of the reign of James II. that the present
church was built; and on its consecration the parish was
formally separated in <date value="1686">1686</date>. The old names of the Soho
fields are preserved by Malcolm in noticing the grant of
a lease from queen Henrietta Maria, by leave of her son,
to lord St. Albans, who already, as we have seen, held
St. James's. They were Bunche's Close, Coleman-hedge
Field, and Doghouse Field, otherwise Brown's Close.
Kemp's Field, where there had been a chapel for French










<pb n="98" id="p.98"/>

refugees, was chosen as the site of the church. The Pest
Field which lord Craven generously provided against
the possible outbreak of another plague,<note place="foot" n="46">See below, chap. xxi.</note> lay to the east
of Carnaby Street. Crown Street was Hog Lane.
Wardour Street was Old Soho. Princes Street was
Hedge Lane.</p>
<p>  The church of St. Anne incurs much ridicule from the
very strange appearance of its steeple. <quote>A monstrous
copper globe, elevated within a few feet of the summit,
contains the dial plates for the clock.</quote><note place="foot" n="47">Malcolm, ii. 344.</note> It was built at
the end of the last century. The interior of the church
is by no means what might be expected from the distant
view of the tower, on the western face of which, and
plainly visible from Princes Street-now incorporated
with Wardour Street-is the tablet Horace Walpole
put up, with his own epigram on it, to the memory of
Theodore, king of Corsica, who died in <date value="1756">1756</date>, and was
buried at the expense of an oilman named Wright.</p>
<p>  Soho Square, which contains about three acres, was
for a while very fashionable, and only began to decline
a hundred years ago. Few remember the name of Mrs.
Theresa Cornelys. Yet she was once a central figure in
the <placeName key="London">London</placeName> world of fashion, which she left for a more
retired sphere in <date value="1785">1785</date>. Her house is now occupied by
Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, whose manufactory is
close by, and fumes of strawberry jam, raspberry vinegar,
and mixed pickles alternately pervade the neighbourhood. Her ball room is a chapel. It used to be the
headquarters of extravagance and strange apparel. At
one of her masquerades the beautiful daughter of a peer
wore the costume of an Indian princess, three black girls
bearing her train, a canopy held over her head by two
negro boys, and her dress covered with jewels worth a









            <pb n="99" id="p.99"/>

hundred thousand pounds. It was at another that Adam
was to be seen in flesh-coloured tights and an apron of
artificial fig-leaves, in company with the duchess of Bolton
as Diana. Death in a white shroud carried about his
coffin and epitaph.. The duke of Gloucester wore an old
English costume with a star on his cloak, and the
malicious said he was <quote>disguised as a gentleman.</quote> All
this pageantry passed through Mrs. Cornelys' rooms, yet
before many years had gone by she was earning her
living by selling asses' milk at Knightsbridge. Even
this employment failed her eventually, and in <date value="1797">1797</date> she
died in the Fleet Prison, forming schemes for retrieving
her broken fortunes to the last.</p>
<p>  Long before Mrs. Cornelys was thought of, King's
Square in Soho was connected with the fortunes of
another and more famous adventurer. James, duke of
Montrose and Buccleugh, lived on the south side, where
there is now a hospital for women. Bateman's Buildings
is on the site of his garden. The tottering statue of his
father in the centre of the square was the only thing left
that could have seen him here, and it also has disappeared.
He gave "Soho" as his watchword the night before
Sedgmoor, but he never saw his old home again.</p>
<p>  It is more pleasant to recall some later memories : for
there is still an old-world air about the place. If you
dive down into the streets and lanes you see everywhere
evidences of the greatness of former occupants. If a
street door is open there is a vision of carved oak panelling, of fretted ceilings, of frescoed walls, of inlaid floors.
Squalid as are some of the tenements, their inhabitants
do not need to dream that they dwell in marble halls.
Once on a time even Seven Dials was fashionable. Here
and there, at the corners, a little bit of the quaint style
now in vogue as queen Anne's allures the unwary




<pb n="100" id="p.100"/>

passenger into a noisome alley, and Soho can boast of
fully as many smells as Cologne. The paradoxes in
which facts and statistics are so often connected may
receive another example from this densely populated
and still more densely perfumed region, for it has been
found that children survive the struggles of infancy better
in Soho than in many a high and airy country parish.
Paintings by Sir James Thornhill and Angelica Kauffman are to be seen in some of the houses.  Modern
cast-iron railings may stand abashed before the finely-wrought work which incloses some of the filthiest areas.
There are mantelpieces in marble, heavy with Corinthian
columns, and elaborate entablatures in many an upper
chamber let at so much a week. Visitors to the House
of Mercy at the corner of Greek Street have an uncovenanted reward for their charity in seeing how the
great alderman Beckford was lodged when he made the
speech now inscribed on his monument in Guildhall.<note place="foot" n="48">See above, chap. xiv.</note>
Art still reigns in the house opposite, where the Royal
Academy held its infant meetings, and it was close by,
at the corner of Compton Street, that Johnson and
Boswell, Reynolds and Burke, kept their literary evenings, and were derided by Goldsmith. The more purely
scientific associations of the place are almost equally
remarkable. On the south side of the square, in the
corner near Frith Street, Sir Joseph Banks and Mr.
Payne Knight successively flourished, and the Linnaean
Society had here its headquarters before it was promoted
to Burlington House.  Since the whole of Soho was
more or less fashionable, it is nothing remarkable to find
Evelyn and Burnet and Dryden and Nell Gwyn residing
within its bounds; but there is some interest in the
lying in state there of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, when his









            <pb n="101" id="p.101"/>

body, recovered from the sea at Scilly, was on its way to
Westminster Abbey. No doubt an effigy surmounted
the pall, and the illustrious foundling appeared in the
Roman armour and the full-bottomed wig in which he
reposes upon his monument. Half the sites of curious
scenes in Soho, half the residences of historical characters,
have, however, been left without identification.</p>
<p>  We now come to the most important portion of the old
abbey manor, St. George's, Hanover Square, the greater
part of which, extensive as it is, belongs to a single
estate, that of the duke of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. It comprises
the chief part of the identical manor of Eia which, as
we saw in the last chapter, was given by Geoffrey Mandeville to the abbey. Eia, in Domesday, is said to have
consisted of ten hides. The modern parish comprises, in
round numbers, nearly 900 acres, so that the hides in
question must have been 90 acres, or nearly, each, but
there was a good deal of waste marshy land, and the
size of the hide may be considerably reduced. The name
of Eybury, or Ebury, would appear to denote that part
of the manor which lay around the principal residence
of the lord of the manor, which was almost certainly
somewhere near Grosvenor Square. This portion, which
stretches from the river's bank northward along the
Tyburn to the Uxbridge Road and Oxford Street, forms
the Grosvenor estate. A second portion, the sub-manor
of Neate, or Neyte, is doubtless that part of Kensington
Gardens and the adjoining land which is still in the
parish of St. Margaret. A third portion, Hyde, gives
its name to <placeName key="Hyde Park">Hyde Park</placeName>.<note place="foot" n="49">See next chapter.</note></p>
<p>  There is very great difficulty in unravelling the history
of this part of the possessions of St. Peter's abbey. The
boundaries, where there was much open and common




<pb n="102" id="p.102"/>

land, were not very clearly fixed. The abbot was lord
of all, and in case of difficulty there could be no doubt
of his ownership. He appears to have leased away
Eybury, or a considerable part of it. A man named
Barber, who was hanged in <date value="1345">1345</date> for murdering his
brother, appears to have held it. A dispute arose as to
the abbot's right to seize the land, and though no decision
has been reported, we cannot hesitate to conclude that
the abbot succeeded in his claim. No doubt, too, he
leased it away again: and after the suppression it was in
the hands of one Whashe.<note place="foot" n="50">Cunningham, i. 288.</note> It consisted of a farm of
<pb n="430" id="p.430"/>acres, for which he paid 21&#x00A3;. a year, and he and his
tenants appear from a complaint that was made against
them to queen Elizabeth, to have inclosed the adjoining
open and waste lands, including some in which the
parish had an interest. These Lammas lands, as they
were called, cannot now be identified. Some of them
seem to have been near the Haymarket, and Leicester
Square is described as being built on inclosed Lammas
lands. But Ebury, Euberry, or Eybury was <soCalled>towards
<placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>,</soCalled> and comprised all that part of the Grosvenor
estate which lies south of the great west road from Hyde
Park Corner, including Belgrave Square and Pimlico. A
little later the farm and some other holdings came into
the possession of a member of an obscure family named
Davies. How he obtained them does not appear, but
doubtless in much the same way as Hobson obtained the
two manors of Tyburn and Lylleston on the other side of
Oxford Street.<note place="foot" n="51">See below, chap. xxi.</note>  Davies, however, unlike Hobson, knew
how to keep as well as to obtain a good estate. He, or
his son, Alexander, had an only daughter, Mary. In
<date value="1676">1676</date> Miss Mary Davies was married, at St. Clement







             <pb n="103" id="p.103"/>

Danes, to Sir Thomas Grosvenor, a Cheshire baronet of
moderate fortune.</p>
<p>  Another family of Davies, or the same, had about the
same time that part of the parish on which the two
Audley Streets were afterwards built. " Rich Audley,"
as he was called, who began the world with 200&#x00A3;. and

<date value="1677">1677</date>, a member of the drapers' company, and a bookseller by trade. He had four sons, but there is no Alexander amongst them. It would, however, be difficult to
affirm that there is no connection between the families,
or that Davies Street is called after the one or the other.
The two estates are now in the same hands, but no
record has been published as to how the union came
about. In fact, considering the enormous value of the
Grosvenor estate it is curious to remark that it has never
found a historian, and that, though probably there are
deeds in abundance existing on the subject, we do not
know how it came to Alexander Davies and Hugh
Audley.</p>
<p>  In <date value="1725">1725</date> we find Sir Richard Grosvenor, the elder son
of Mary Davies, in possession of the whole estate. In
July of that year the land had been laid out and planned,
and at a <soCalled>splendid entertainment</soCalled>  Sir Richard assembled
his intending tenants and named the new streets and
squares. Grosvenor Square had been partly built as
early as <date value="1716">1716</date>: but covering the whole estate with houses
was a work of time. The names chosen are easily
accounted for: Brook Street is called after the Tyburn
which forms the eastern boundary of the estate. Mount

Street obliterated "Oliver's Mount," one of the forts
erected by the parliament in <date value="1642">1642</date>.<note place="foot" n="53">See chapter xi. There is an Oliver's Mount in Richmond Park.</note> Grosvenor, Davies
and Audley Streets speak for themselves, as does Park
Street.<note place="foot" n="54">For Hyde Park see next chapter.</note>  The rectangularity of the Grosvenor estate
distinguishes it on the map, and the line of the brook is
clearly marked by the irregular course of South Molton
Lane, Avery Row, Bruton Mews and Bolton Row.</p>
<p>  But this great estate occupied less than half the lands
of the Davies inheritance. The part south of Hyde Park
Corner, though it was not so soon built over, is now even
more valuable. George III. intended to have increased
the gardens of Buckingham Palace westward and had
even arranged with Sir Richard's nephew and successor,
the first lord Grosvenor, to buy the ground on which
Grosvenor Place now stands. But lord Grenville held
the purse strings and the king's wishes were thwarted.
The ground, like that indeed within the palace inclosure
still, was low and damp. We have seen that here lay
Pollenstock and Bulunga Fen and the <soCalled>eald dic</soCalled> or
dyke of Edgar's charter. But lord Grosvenor enlisted
the services of Mr. Cubitt. In <date value="1826">1826</date> he obtained special
powers by act of parliament. The site was drained,
levelled, laid out in roads and streets and squares, which,
considering the unfavourable reputation of the place previously, were taken up eagerly by people of the first
fashion. Belgravia, as it is often called, rivals even the
older Grosvenor district, in its popularity with the highest
classes, and the erection, on the failure of the first building leases, of the magnificent houses of Grosvenor Place,
each of them a palace, has assisted to keep this part of
the estate in the favour of people who can afford to be so
expensively housed. Soon a third quarter arose on the







               <pb n="105" id="p.105"/>

<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> lands, and for a brief period Pimlico was as
fashionable as <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> is now. It very speedily
declined, however, though one or two of the larger squares
have continued to flourish. The local names almost all
allude to the real or supposed history of the Grosvenor
family, to the county and city of Chester, to Hugh
Lupus, to Eccleston and Belgrave in Cheshire, to Eaton
Hall and Halkin Castle. Strange to say we do not find a
single allusion to the heiress who brought the estate into
the Grosvenor family.</p>
<p>  The mansion by the river side continued to be inhabited
until Gloucester House in Grosvenor Street fell vacant
by the death of the younger brother of George III  It
soon after became Grosvenor House, was greatly enlarged
and improved, and a fine screen placed between it and
the street. It is still somewhat irregular, but a fine
addition has recently been made to its western end. The
removal of an adjoining house in which lady Palmerston
passed her declining years, has opened a view from Hyde
Park and greatly improved the situation, but in most
respects it is very inferior to Dorchester House, close by,
where the utmost advantage was taken by Mr. Holford
of the site. Dorchester House was, it is understood,
designed by its owner, but the architect who carried out
the plans was named Vulliamy. Grosvenor House
presents no architectural features requiring notice. The
older house was often described as at Millbank. It had
been inhabited for a time by the eccentric earl of Peterborough and was called after him.<note place="foot" n="55">Cunningham remarks briefly on the difficulties in Pennant's 'Account'
  relating to the history of this house. There is a plan in the supplement to

occupies the site.  It has been declared extraparochial by act of parliament. But while the Grosvenors
inhabited Peterborough House it was in the parish of St.
John, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, the last division of St. Margaret's
which I have to notice. Before doing so, however, it will
be well to state clearly that this house at Millbank was
not the manor house of Eia, nor yet the farm house of
Ebury. It was in a different parish, and in the original
manor of the abbey of Westminster, and was purchased
by the Grosvenor family on account of its convenient
situation. It was described in <date value="1800">1800</date> as <quote>a brick house
with a pretty garden.</quote><note place="foot" n="56">Walcott, 338.</note> The house of Eybury was much
more likely in or near Davies Street, where the estate
office stands now.</p>
<p>  St. George's, Hanover Square, is in the north-eastern
corner of the parish, fully two miles from the river's bank.
It was designed by John James, and being one of the fifty
new churches erected at the beginning of the eighteenth
century by virtue of an act of parliament, it was in its
place before the parish became populous, and was consecrated in <date value="1724">1724</date>. The portico is very handsome, but the
rest of the building is dark and heavy. The east end is
set off by two quaint and irregular brick buildings used
as vestries, the architect having apparently omitted to
provide any: a serious omission in a church which for
many years was so fashionable for weddings that couples
often put themselves to considerable inconvenience to
acquire a domicile in St. George's. But the parish has
been divided again and again since <date value="1844">1844</date>, and a new
marriage act has made matrimony lawful in almost any
one of the many district chapels of the parish. The
most important of these are St. Peter's, Eaton Square,
the district attached to which includes all but the front







              <pb n="107" id="p.107"/>

wall of Buckingham Palace, and the so-called Grosvenor
Chapel, in South Audley Street, which perhaps boasts of
the most aristocratic congregation in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. Attached to
this chapel is an extensive cemetery, which was so rapidly
filled that in forty years from the opening a new place of
burial had to be found, and five acres of Tyburn Field,
also now closed, were consecrated in <date value="1764">1764</date>.<note place="foot" n="57">See chap. xxi.</note></p>
<p>  The last parish formally separated from St. Margaret's
was St. John's, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. Its church is by Vanbrugh's
pupil, Archer, and is in a most eccentric style. It resembles, according to one author, <quote>a parlour table upset,
with its legs in the air.</quote><note place="foot" n="58">Cunningham, 446.</note>  It was begun in <date value="1721">1721</date>, and
finished and consecrated in <date value="1738">1738</date>. Archer built Cliefden,
a handsome pile, and one or two other great houses;
but his designs, some of which were engraved in
the 'Vitruvius Britannicus,' do not entitle him to further
notice. The parish is very densely populated, and has
several district churches; but the visitor who seeks for
anything of interest in it will probably be disappointed.
St. Stephen's, built by Ferry for lady Burdett-Coutts,
who endowed it, is a handsome gothic church, and was
much needed in the parish. Blore built St. Mary's; and
there are several others, but to most of them, architecturally speaking, the epitaph on a lady in Fulham
churchyard will apply:-

<p>IT has often been noted as a curious fact that all the
royal palaces of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> are in the original parish of
St. Margaret. An exception being made of the Tower, the
same remains true of the ancient residences of our kings.
For Bridewell, Somerset House, the Savoy, and Whitehall are all in the district which in <date value="951">951</date> was defined as
the manor of the abbey. The more modern palaces are,
however, situated in various divisions of the parish. St.
James's is not in the parish of St. James, but in that of
St. Martin. Buckingham Palace is partly in St. Martin's
and partly in St. George's. The Houses of Parliament
stand across the boundary-line of St. John's and St.
Margaret's. Kensington Palace is altogether in St. Margaret's.</p>
<p>  Whitehall, previously York Place, shows little trace
of the magnificent house which cardinal Wolsey built
for himself, and which Henry VIII. took from him, as he
had before taken Hampton Court. The Treasury is on
the site of Wolsey's great hall, and now replaces a smaller
building which was adapted from Wolsey's, and cleverly
altered from a gothic into a classical style by the simple
expedient of making the buttresses into pilasters. Even
this has disappeared, and except the Banqueting Hall,
there is no building left which existed before the fire of
<date value="1698">1698</date>. It is now called Whitehall Chapel, though it has
never been consecrated, except by the blood of the

<soCalled>blessed king Charles the martyr.</soCalled> Between Scotland
Yard and the Embankment stands an old house, the
foundations or lower storey of which appear to be of
ancient masonry. How long this relic of palatial Whitehall may survive I know not.</p>
<p>  Nowhere does the arbitrary and tyrannical turn of
Henry's mind show itself more plainly than in the almost
cynical disregard of the public convenience that prompted
his arrangements at Whitehall. He found it convenient
to speak of <quote>our manor of Westminster,</quote> meaning the
palace burnt in <date value="1512">1512</date>, which had long been the headquarters of royalty. He now transferred this title to
Whitehall. In <date value="1536">1536</date> an act was passed by which it
was enacted <quote>that the old and ancient palace of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> from henceforth be reputed, deemed and taken
only as a member and parcel</quote> of the new palace of
Whitehall. The <quote>king's palace at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName></quote> was
to mean no longer the old palace of Edward and
<persName key="Rufus, William">William Rufus</persName>, of Henry III. and Edward IV., but the
new residence just finished by the cardinal archbishop,
and just appropriated by his unscrupulous sovereign.
The addition of St. James's Park to the new palace completed the usurpation, and the abbot was wholly cut off
from his possessions to the northward and eastward of
Whitehall. Finally, he was forced to give the king that
part of Mandeville's bequest which was distinguished
from Eybury and Neyte as Hyde. Thus, then, in
<date value="1545">1545</date>, Henry was able to issue the extraordinary proclamation in the collection of the Society of Antiquaries.<note place="foot" n="1"> <quote>Ten copies printed for Islington Collectors.-Impensis J. H. Burn.</quote>

to the mayor and sheriffs of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, and it is not upon

clear contravention of their charters. That the king had
attained such a pitch of personal and irresponsible power

citizens for <quote>his owne disport and pastime,</quote> made it easy
for him to change the boundaries of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> and
St. Martin's, as we saw in the last chapter, and to plant
his park and palace right across the principal road from
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</p>
<p>   Henry added greatly to the house as Wolsey left it, and
his works went on for seven years.<note place="foot" n="2">In Smith's ' <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>' there are views and plans of old Whitehall.

<p>  At first Whitehall was distinguished as the <soCalled>New
Palace,</soCalled> and, in queen Elizabeth's reign, as the  <soCalled>Queen's
Palace </soCalled>; but the name of  <soCalled>Whitehall</soCalled> became common
soon after the accession of James, in whose time Sir
Symonds Dewes distinguishes between <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> and
Whitehall. James, among many magnificent projects,
set <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo Jones</persName> to design him a new palace for Whitehall, and, like his ancestor Henry VIII., he did not
consult the convenience of his subjects in the proposed
arrangements. The <quote>open street before Whitehall,</quote> in
which his son was afterwards to be beheaded, but which
at this time was commonly used in the passage from
<placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, would have been almost
closed, so small were the archways designed for the north
and south fronts.  The drawings of Jones have been
frequently engraved and published: but the palace never
existed except on paper. It would have been the largest
in Europe, exceeding even Mafra, the gigantic building
which is so conspicuous from the deck of passing steamers
on the Portuguese coast, and which is generally looked
upon as the largest in the world. But Jones made a
second and smaller design,<note place="foot" n="3">'Vitruvius Britannicus,' i. 12, 13.</note> of which one small portion
only was built, a banqueting hall,<note place="foot" n="4">See Cunningham, ii. 915. The Banqueting Hall cost 14,940&#x00A3;. 4s. 1d.
It was finished in <date value="1622">1622</date>.</note>  of stone, which was to
have been balanced by a chapel, the connecting portions
to be of Inigo's favourite material, red brick.</p>
<p>  A little to the north of the Banqueting Hall was Scotland
Yard, a locality said to have been so called from the
<soCalled>abiding there</soCalled>  of Margaret, queen of Scots, the sister



<pb n="112" id="p.112"/>

of Henry VIII. Stow adds that the kings of Scotland
lodged at the same place when they attended the English
parliament: but as a rule, the Scots kings who visited
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> before the time of the Tudors inhabited more
secure but less commodious apartments in the Tower.
Queen Margaret, among queens, holds a position in one
respect very like that of her brother among kings. Both
were exceedingly addicted to marriage.  Margaret lost
her first husband, James IV., in <date value="1513">1513</date>.  He was killed at
Flodden, fighting against the army of his wife's brother, in
September of that year. His widow's second son was still
unborn but she lost no time in looking out for a second
husband, and married him eleven months after the king's
tragical death. Angus, her bridegroom, was not yet of age,
while she was twenty-six. In less than four years she
made up her mind to divorce him; her sister-in-law,
Katharine of Arragon, who did not know the fate in
store for herself, endeavoured in vain to dissuade her.
She had fallen in love with Albany, the regent, though
he had a wife living. But ten years elapsed before the
divorce was pronounced, and queen Margaret had
changed her mind about Albany, and had lost her
beauty from small-pox. Her third husband was Henry
Stuart, Lord Methven, with whom she soon quarrelled,
and when she died in <date value="1541">1541</date>, she had begun to take steps
for a reconciliation with Angus.</p>
<p>  There are many views of the so-called Scotland
Yard,<note place="foot" n="5">This name appears, after the fire of <date value="1698">1698</date>, to have been applied indiscriminately to two courts of the palace, and to the two original Scotland
Yards besides. See Smith's Plan.</note> and they are of interest chiefly as telling on the
question of where Charles I. was beheaded. The real
Scotland Yard was further north. For some reason a
theory was started and plausibly maintained that the





                 <pb n="113" id="p.113"/>

 scaffold stood on the roof of a house which closely
 adjoined the northern end of the Banqueting Hall, and
 was in fact the gateway of the principal court of the
 palace. A view by Sandby, who erroneously calls it
 Scotland Yard, shows the gate as consisting of an arch,
 with a tall peaked roof surmounted by a ball, and flanked
 with two chimneys. It is impossible that a scaffold
 should have been erected here: but between it and
 the end of the hall are two other very irregular tiled
 roofs. Had the scaffold been placed on them, the taller
 gate would have prevented any but those people who
 were stationed directly in front from witnessing the
 execution. We know that it was plainly visible from
 the top of a house which stood where the Admiralty is
 now, because archbishop Ussher, who was on that roof,
 fainted when he saw the king's head fall. The local
 conditions therefore point to a different place, and the
 contemporary evidence, slight as it is, indicates the open
 space on the western side, or front of the Banqueting
 Hall.<note place="foot" n="6">See Jesse's 'Court of England under the Stuarts,' i. 466.</note> The words of the death warrant are explicit.
 The execution is directed to take place <quote>in the open
 street before Whitehall.</quote> The scaffold stood between
 the centre of the hall and the north end, and was
 approached by a platform which was erected in front of
 an aperture broken in the wall, at the level of the top of
 the lower windows. An exit might have been made
 by one of the windows, but Herbert, the king's personal
 attendant, mentions  <quote>a passage broken through the wall.</quote> <quote>At the recent renovation of the Banqueting-House,</quote>
 writes Jesse, in <date value="1840">1840</date>, <quote>the author was invited to visit the
 spot, when the passage in question was plainly perceptible. For a space of about seven feet in height and four
in breadth, the bricks presented a broken and jagged






<pb n="114" id="p.114"/>

appearance, and the brickwork introduced was evidently
of a more modern date.</quote> This should be conclusive. It
was probably considered more difficult to reach the high
level of the windows, than to make a new exit.</p>
<p>  The necessity of opening a better approach to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> than could be obtained along King Street,
led to the destruction of a building only second
in interest to  the  Banqueting  Hall.  This was
the southern gateway, a beautiful design always attributed to Holbein.<note place="foot" n="7">There are engravings of it in many books.</note> When it was removed, in the
very year in which the Londoners removed their
old gates, and took the houses off London Bridge, the
duke of Cumberland had the bricks numbered and
carried to Windsor: but they were never set up again,
just as the screen of Burlington House and the stones of
Temple Bar, and other numbered buildings one could
name, have been ruined under a promise of restitution
never fulfilled. When a dean and chapter, or an inn
treasurer, or a board of works, or an over-zealous official
of the woods and forests department, desire to carry out
some special act of vandalism, the indignant section of
the public is assured and pacified by the promise that
the stones shall be numbered and set up again. They
are accordingly numbered, which costs little, but they
are not set up again.</p>
<p>   At the opposite side of St. James's Park, when Henry
 first inclosed it, stood a large hospital or almshouse, the
 out-buildings of which reached as far as the crest of the
 hill and abutted on the western road.<note place="foot" n="8">Some remains of the older buildings have lately been found in Arlington
 Street.</note>  On this institution Henry naturally cast an envious eye. He could
 not take his pleasure nor disport himself in his new park





                   <pb n="115" id="p.115"/>

without seeing it: and at the dissolution of religious
houses he hastened to take possession. There must
have been but little accommodation for a court, but
Henry added something, and it became a kind of villa
or hunting lodge. The design of the new buildings is
said by tradition to have been made by <persName key="Cromwell, Thomas">Thomas Cromwell</persName>, earl of Essex, which is not very likely.  The old
gateway or clock-tower which looks up St. James's
Street is not very beautiful, and perhaps on account of
its insignificant character has escaped when better
buildings have been destroyed or <soCalled>restored,</soCalled> but it is
venerable, and, when it was taller than the surrounding
houses, may have looked almost stately. On a chimneypiece in one of the chambers are still visible the initials
of the king and his ill-fated victim Anne Boleyn. The
chapel still shows something more than a trace of Tudor
work, and is as quaint a little building of the kind as
any in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</p>
<p>  Though Mary lived-and indeed died-in St. James's
Palace, it was not in much favour until it was appointed
as a residence for the precocious and promising Henry,
prince of Wales, elder son of James I. He too died in
St. James's, of fever as was supposed, being only nineteen,
and left no mark on the place, which, however, must
have grown considerably since the days of Henry VIII.,
for the prince's household amounted to some four hundred
persons.  Charles I. made it the headquarters of his
great collections, and especially of his books, many of
his pictures being at Whitehall.<note place="foot" n="9">Pyne, 'Royal Residences,' iii. 16.</note>  He slept here the
night before his execution, and on the morning of the
following day, at ten o'clock, walked through the park
with colonel Hacker, attended by bishop Juxon, the
way lined with troops, and guards of halberdiers before






<pb n="116" id="p.116"/>

and behind with colours flying and drums beating.
" Once during his walk, being apparently faint, he sat
down and rested himself."<note place="foot" n="10">Jesse, i. 464.</note>  Perhaps it was then that he
pointed out the tree his brother had planted. If so, his
resting-place must have been near the spot where milch
cows, by an ancient custom, are now stationed.</p>
<p>  St. James's was also occupied the night before their
execution by Hamilton, Holland, and Capel, who were
similarly taken across the park to Sir Robert Cotton's
house in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and then through <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
Hall to the scaffold in New Palace Yard.
  Charles II. did not make much use of St. James's; but
James his brother occupied it as duke of York, and occasionally also after he ascended the throne. In <date value="1688">1688</date> Mary

it was not until the great fire at Whitehall in <date value="1698">1698</date> that
St. James's attained the honour of giving its name to the
English court. The range of buildings facing Cleveland
Row was made for Frederick, prince of Wales, on his
marriage, and a few other additions of small importance,
including a detached library for queen Caroline, were
among the alterations; but St. James's Palace often
excited the wonder of foreigners on account of its mean
appearance. The south side of what used to be and is
still called the Stable Yard, was built for the duke of
York, the second son of George III., but never inhabited
by him.<note place="foot" n="12">The house is now known as Stafford House, and was sold to the
duke of Sutherland, the price, 72,000&#x00A3;., being applied to the purchase
of Victoria Park, Bethnal Green.</note>  His brother, the duke of Cambridge, had apartments




                 <pb n="117" id="p.117"/>

at the other end of the palace, which were burnt
in <date value="1809">1809</date>. A little further east is the German Chapel, a
relic of the old Hanoverian days; and behind it the residence of the great duke of Marlborough, now occupied
by the prince of Wales. A modern roadway into the
park has been made here. Still further east stood another
royal residence, Carlton House, the ephemeral palace of
George IV. To its situation we owe Regent Street.<note place="foot" n="13">Pyne has elaborate views of Carlton House.</note> To
its wretched architecture and miserable colonnade we
owe the front of the National Gallery. The whole site
on which Marlborough and Carlton Houses stood was
part of the royal garden belonging to St. James's Palace,
and was leased away by queen Anne. It has all reverted
to the Crown, and Carlton House Terrace and Gardens
occupy the site, except that portion which immediately
surrounds Marlborough House.</p>
<p>  The park has changed as much as St. James's; but
the old stream of the Tyburn still flows through it,
though no longer tidal, and makes its way underground
to Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, whence it escapes into
the Thames. The ducks and other wild-fowl may be
looked upon as the successors, perhaps in some cases the
descendants, of those to which Charles II. devoted so
much attention; but Rosamond's Pond, the favourite of
suicides, has disappeared. A mulberry garden was
planted by James I. on the site of Buckingham Palace,
with a view to encourage the cultivation of silkworms;
and a keeper of the mulberries flourished among the pensioners of the court till <date value="1672">1672</date>.</p>
<p>  Charles II. leased the grounds and the keeper's house
to a member of the cabal ministry, Bennet, earl of Arlington, who is commemorated in the names of two streets at
the top of St. James's Street, where he also had a house,



<pb n="118" id="p.118"/>

on land given him by the same king.    Arlington
House, at the western extremity of St. James's Park,
became Buckingham House in <date value="1709">1709</date>, when Sheffield, duke
of Buckingham, who had bought it six years previously,
made many alterations, pulled down a long gallery, and
laid out the quondam mulberry gardens anew. This
eccentric but accomplished man has left a long and interesting account of his house, in a letter to the duke of
Shrewsbury, which forms, in fact, a complete description
of a great house in the real "Queen Anne" taste, of
which we hear so much now.<note place="foot" n="14">It is printed in Pyne, vol. ii., and summarised by Cunningham, i. 144.</note>    He tells us of the
goodly rows of elms and limes in St. James's Park as
forming an avenue for him, and goes on to mention
his forecourt with its iron railings and basin with
statues and waterworks. A terrace was raised in front
of the house, and the entrance-hall was spacious, <quote>the
walls thereof covered with a set of pictures done
in the school of Raphael.</quote> His parlour was thirty-
three feet by thirty-nine, and had a niche for a buffet
fifteen feet wide, paved and lined with marble, and
flanked by coloured pilasters. The staircase was painted
with the story of Dido, and the roof, fifty-five feet from
the ground, was <quote>filled with the figures of gods and
goddesses.</quote> The first room upstairs <quote>has within it a
closet, of original pictures, which yet are not so entertaining as the delightful prospect from the windows.</quote> In the
garden there was a broad walk, at the end of which  <quote>you
go up to a terrace four hundred paces long, with a large
semicircle in the middle, from whence are beheld the
queen's two parks, and a great part of Surry.</quote> Among
the other attractions was <quote>a canal six hundred yards
long and seventeen broad,</quote> the Tyburn, no doubt, under
altered circumstances; and on one side, presumably the



                <pb n="119" id="p.119"/>

western, a wall, purposely kept low, was covered with
roses and jessamines, and afforded, over it, a <quote>view of a
meadow full of cattle just beneath-no disagreeable
object in the midst of a great city.</quote> Finally, there was a
<quote>little wilderness, full of blackbirds and nightingales.</quote></p>
<p>  There is a pretty little view of this house in an old
volume<note place="foot" n="15">'A Character of John Sheffield, Duke of Buckinghamshire,' <date value="1729">1729</date>.</note> published a few years after the duke's death,
from which it appears that the <soCalled>basin</soCalled> in the forecourt, mentioned above, had in the centre a figure of
Neptune surrounded with sea-horses. The house was
deeply recessed and had long wings, connected with the
main building by colonnades.</p>
<p>  In <date value="1761">1761</date> it was decided to give up Somerset House,
which had previously been a dower house for the queens
of England, to be turned into public offices, and Buckingham House was purchased in its stead from the duke's
heirs, for 21,000&#x00A3;., and settled in <date value="1775">1775</date> on queen Charlotte.
Here George III. accumulated the splendid library which
George IV. handed over to the nation, and which now
forms the King's Library at the British Museum. The
king erected a couple of large rooms for its reception,<note place="foot" n="16">Shown in two views in Pyne, vol. ii.</note>
and in one of them, in <date value="1767">1767</date>, he had an interview with
Dr. Johnson, of which many details are preserved by
Boswell.<note place="foot" n="17">Life, ii. 36.</note>  George IV. rebuilt the house, now become
Buckingham Palace, but never inhabited it; and during
the present reign it has been completely remodelled and
much added to, the result being far from satisfactory. In
fact, though it is one of the largest palaces in Europe, its
poor architecture, and the tawdry style of the decoration,
give it a meanness of appearance almost unaccountable.
The only handsome thing about the old palace was the








<pb n="120" id="p.120"/>

marble triumphal arch in front; but this was removed in
<date value="1851">1851</date> to the north-eastern entrance of Hyde Park. The
eastern facade of the palace is 360 feet in length.</p>
<p>  The gardens are beautifully laid out and have some
fine trees, as well as a lake, and a pavilion or summer
house decorated with frescoes, illustrating Milton's
"Comus," by Landseer, Stanfield, Maclise, Eastlake,
Dyce, Leslie, Uwins and Ross, an odd combination <note place="foot" n="18">Landseer's original design, "The Masque of Comus," is in the
National Gallery.</note> of
styles and artists. The low situation of the gardens along
the ancient course of the Tyburn, is much to be deplored,
and except in the finest weather they are damp and
foggy. When Buckingham could look out on fields with
cattle to the westward, they may have been more cheerful, but George III. failed to purchase these fields owing
to a ministerial complication, and Grosvenor Place, much
of which has recently been rebuilt in a palatial style, now
looks over the gardens.</p>
<p>  A road called Constitution Hill, now in process of
rearrangement, leads along the eastern side of the royal
gardens to Hyde Park Corner, where, until this year, the
duke of Wellington in bronze looked down on Piccadilly,
close to Apsley House. The Green Park of 56 acres
connects St. James's and Hyde Parks, and has a pleasing
and varied surface, through which the course of the
brook can be traced by a winding depression. A large
pond used to lie nearly in the centre, but was filled up in
<date value="1842">1842</date>, when the Ranger's Lodge,<note place="foot" n="19">The two stags on the gate pillars of the Lodge now adorn the Albert
Gate, Knightsbridge. Larwood, 'London Parks,' 318.</note>  which the gossip of
the day attributed to George III., was pulled down,
and the little park assumed its modern appearance.
Some fine houses in the Stable Yard and Arlington

Street look into it on the eastern side, the most remarkable of which are Spencer House, designed by Vardy,
but believed to have been founded on a drawing by <persName key="Jones, Inigo">Inigo
Jones</persName>, with the addition of a pediment which goes far to
spoil it; and Bridgewater House, designed in a magnificent Italian style by Sir Charles Barry. Although
some of the houses along <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName> which look on the
Green Park have been built with very little regard to
cost, not one of them presents any architectural features
worth notice, or, indeed, worthy of the situation.</p>
<p>  We enter Hyde Park by a gate beside Apsley House
which strange to say has never received a name. The
triple archway with the connecting screen of Ionic
columns is extremely pleasing, and rescues the reputation of the designer, Decimus Burton, from the obscurity
in which most of his other works would leave it. The
park forms the central part of the great manor of Eia,
being bounded on the east by Eybury and on the west by
Neyte. Some portions of Eybury were added to Hyde
in the last century to make a straight boundary, and in
<date value="1825">1825</date> the wall along Park Lane was removed and an iron
railing erected-the same which fell before the attack of
a crowd of agitators a few years ago,-when opportunity
was taken to set the fence further back, thus widening
Park Lane, and improving its appearance and size.</p>
<p>  A similar wall stretched along the northern side, and
the road being at a somewhat higher level, especially at
the corner, a private individual raised the soil of the park,
and obtained leave to open a gate facing Great Cumberland Place.<note place="foot" n="20">'Hyde Park,' by Thomas Smith (p. 60); by far the best account of
Hyde Park I have met with, but rather scarce, having been issued in paper
covers at a shilling. It escaped the notice of Lowndes.</note> This corner, close to the place of execution
at Tyburn, is commemorated as the background of a








<pb n="122" id="p.122"/>

scene in Hogarth's prints of the Apprentices. The Idle
Apprentice is about to be hanged, and some of the spectators have climbed on the park wall for a better view.
Within the wall at the corner military executions used to
take place, and when the ground was raised a stone
which marked the spot was buried where it stood. Here,
in August <date value="1716">1716</date> two soldiers were flogged nearly to
death for having worn oak branches on the 29th May:
and the only gallows ever set up in Hyde Park were
placed here in order to hang sergeant Smith, in <date value="1747">1747</date>, for
desertion to the Scots rebels two years before. He was
attended from the military prison at the Savoy by the
chaplain.</p>
<p>  The northern boundary of Hyde Park was straightened
like the eastern, by cutting off a portion of the manor
of <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName>: this was done by Henry VIII., and
similarly queen Elizabeth rectified the southern frontier
by bringing it nearly up to the Knightsbridge Road,
forty acres being thus added to the inclosure. The
present appearance of the Serpentine is due to the care of
queen Caroline, who in <date value="1733">1733</date> drained some unwholesome
ponds along the course of the Westbourne, and formed the
very fine sheet of water we now see. I have neither been
able to ascertain the origin of its name nor that of the road
along its southern bank. The Serpentine and Rotten Row
are puzzles alike. The queen, while she thus improved the
park with one hand, robbed it with the other, and the
whole rising ground in Kensington Gardens between the
Bayswater fountains and the sunk fence on the crest of
the hill were originally in Hyde Park. A hundred years
later the water of the Westbourne, being contaminated
with sewage, and liable to inundations, was conducted
into an underground drain, and fresh water supplied
by one of the companies. The handsome bridge,






                    <pb n="123" id="p.123"/>

across which the boundary runs, was built in <date value="1826">1826</date> by
Rennie: and the latest alteration in Hyde Park has been
the re-erection on the old site of the Knightsbridge Barracks, of which the only thing that can be said by way of
commendation is that they are of red brick, and look best
at a considerable distance. They cost 150,000&#x00A3;., and were
completed in <date value="1880">1880</date>, some of the old stonework being used
again, and the old Hanoverian arms replaced. The Ring
of which we hear so much in memoirs of the Stuart
period, and where <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Oliver Cromwell</persName> endangered his life
by driving four-in-hand, was on the slope to the north of
the Serpentine.  A straight avenue of fine young trees
on the eastern side leads from the ridiculous statue of
Wellington naked as Achilles, to a round sunk garden, in
the centre of which is a pretty fountain which never flows.
Here was the reservoir often mentioned in books of the
last century, and previously first the stables of Grosvenor
House, and then a cavalry barrack. Hyde Park now
covers nearly 400 acres.<note place="foot" n="21">Mr. Nathan Cole, 'Royal Parks,' p. 20. It is sometimes erroneously
asserted that Kensington Gardens are larger than Hyde Park, but they only
cover 250 acres.</note></p>
<p>  I have no hesitation in identifying Kensington Gardens
with the manor of Neyte. The boundary between it and
Hyde was formed by the Westbourne, and the bridge
which carried the western road over the brook was Neyte
Bridge, or, vulgarly, Knightsbridge. Some confusion has
arisen on the question, because in Pepys' and other contemporary books there are mentions of "neat houses,"
which are known to have been at <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>. But " neat
houses," or in modern language, "cowhouses," though we
still say "neat cattle," and occasionally "neat herd,"
might stand anywhere, and though part of <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> is
isolated in <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName>,<note place="foot" n="22">See below, chapter xxi.</note>  we have no knowledge of any




<pb n="124" id="p.124"/>

part of St. Margaret's being isolated in <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>. Moreover, allowing that Eia was divided into three portions,
and that one was Eybury, and another Hyde, how can
we otherwise identify the land which lay west of the
brook, seeing we know it was neither part of Eybury nor
yet of Hyde ?</p>
<p>  We are driven therefore to believe that the manor
house of Neyte, where the great abbot Litlington and the
still better known abbot Islip<note place="foot" n="23">Litlington in <date value="1386">1386</date>, and Islip in <date value="1532">1532</date>.
</note> died, was situated not very
far from the site of Kensington Palace, if not actually upon
it.  Nottingham House,<note place="foot" n="24">For further particulars as to Kensington Gardens I may refer to the
notes I appended to Mr. Tristram Ellis's ' Six Etchings.'</note>  as it was called in the reign of
William III., was probably put on the ancient site,
especially as it would not be easy to find a better.
William III. bought it in <date value="1690">1690</date> for 20,000&#x00A3;., and the old
house was soon afterwards burnt. Sir Christopher Wren
rebuilt it, but little trace of his hand can now be made
out, except in the very handsome orangery, in the gardens
to the north, which was begun for William but finished
for Anne. There are massive and handsome gate-posts
close by to the westward, and here probably was the
roadway to Campden House, when all the hill was bare,
except of a cottage or two among the gravel pits.
Another possible relic of Wren is a charming semicircular
alcove or summer house, which now stands in the further
portion of the gardens beyond the Bayswater fountains,
but which was originally close to Kensington High Street,
where a wall hid the pleasure grounds from the passersby. Parallel with the Broad Walk, which forms now the
most pleasing feature of Kensington Gardens, is a new
roadway which traverses what used to be known as the
Moor, and is now called Palace Green.  The second






                 <pb n="125" id="p.125"/>

house on the left was built by Thackeray from his own
designs, to be in harmony with the palace opposite, and
with what may be called the local genius; and here he
died in <date value="1863">1863</date>. Close by there used to be a small pointed
building containing an interesting chamber of considerable antiquity. It was probably built as a conduit to
supply water to the house of Henry VIII. at <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>,
and was sold with that house on several occasions. No
respect was shown it when the royal vegetable garden
was laid out afresh for villas in <date value="1855">1855</date>, and one of the few
little bits of genuine gothic perished from the west end of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>. What the spirit was in which these hideous
villas were erected may be judged when we hear that
people who took building sites were forbidden to use red
brick, though plaster and mud-coloured paint were
allowed. A very curious tower was erected on the Moor
for the water supply in queen Anne's reign, by Sir John
Vanbrugh, to whom, whatever we think of his taste, must
be allowed the merit of originality. This too has disappeared.</p>
<p>  Kensington Gardens have, however, been enriched by
the erection of the Albert Memorial, an enormous Cross,
in a style which may be termed Italian gothic. It rises
175 feet, and cost 132,000&#x00A3;. It is incrusted with precious
stones and heavily gilt, and a bronze seated statue of
the prince by Foley is also gilt. Four reliefs representing
artists and poets are below, and as many groups emblematic of the four quarters of the globe, flank the
central structure. The cross, taken altogether, has a
sumptuous appearance which, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, is perhaps the best we can expect of
it. Given an immense sum of money, gathered amid
such an outburst of public feeling as has never been seen
in England since the death of queen Elizabeth, and no

great architect ready to take advantage of the opportunity,
and we may be thankful that Sir <persName key="Scott, Gilbert">Gilbert Scott</persName>, in a building every part of which is borrowed from something
else, and which would not stand an hour except for a
clever piece of internal mechanism which cannot be
called architecture, succeeded first in raising a very conspicuous monument and also in spending the money at
his disposal in so small a space.</p>
<p>  There is a charm about old Kensington Palace<note place="foot" n="25">There are several interiors and an interesting description of the palace
in Pyne.
</note>  which
eludes the ordinary grasp of artistic or architectural terms.
Its red brick, its blue slates, its heavy cornice, its quaint
clock turret, a certain fitness of proportion, are aided by
the most charming situation in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, and perhaps by
the historical associations, to produce an effect on the
mind only second to that produced by Hampton Court.
To those of us who have had the good fortune to be
born and to live into middle age as the subjects of queen
Victoria, her birth-place is in itself an object of interest.
To all who have looked back with pride on the great
days of a former queen, when most of the palace
was built, while England's ascendancy abroad was being
secured; to all who remember the career of the first
Prime Minister, and reflect that these vistas and walks
were laid out by that other queen who made office
possible to him in the days of George II.; and finally to
any one who has read of William III. and his gentle
consort in the glowing pages of the great historian who
lived and died close by on Campden Hill, Kensington
Palace cannot fail to prove an object of the highest
interest.</p>
<p>  One ancient royal park remains to be noticed, although
it is not and never was within the boundary of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.



                 <pb n="127" id="p.127"/>

We have seen that Henry VIII. was able to
take his disport without interruption from St. James's
to Highgate. The connecting link between these extremities was St. Marylebone, with its open common.
When the manor was granted by king James to Edward
Forset,<note place="foot" n="26">See below, chap. xxi.</note> "Marybone Park" was specially reserved.
Charles I. in his troubles mortgaged it to Sir George
Strode and John Wandesforde, who had supplied him
with arms and ammunition for the prosecution of the
war.  This hypothecation was of course disregarded
when the royal cause was lost, and the park was assigned
for the payment of the arrears due to colonel Thomas
Harrison's dragoon regiment. It thus a second time
in a few years was in danger of being broken up; but it
survived some time longer, had its rangers, its lodge, its
timber, until in <date value="1765">1765</date>, we find it divided into twenty-four
small holdings, chiefly laid out as farms, and in <date value="1789">1789</date> the
duke of Portland bought up fifteen of them from a
lessee, while the other nine accumulated in the hands of
Peter Hinde, whose name still occurs on street corners
near Manchester Square.<note place="foot" n="27">Smith's 'St. Marylebone,' p. 243.</note>
  Both leases, that of the duke of Portland and that of
Peter Hinde, expired early in the present century, and
the crown came into possession. The whole of the lands
had been surveyed a few years previously, and a list of
the farms and fields has been preserved, which contains
many items of topographical interest.<note place="foot" n="28">Smith, p. 244.</note>  There are three
large farms and a number of smaller holdings.  Mr.
Thomas Willan holds 288 acres, and has several undertenants, one of whom is employed as a maker of copal
varnish. Mr. Richard Kendall holds 133 acres, and has
some tenants, who appear to live in villas; for there is a





<pb n="128" id="p.128"/>

<quote>garden let to Sir Richard Hill, bart.,</quote> and a house, two
gardens, and a shed, let to George Stewart, esq. Among
the inclosures is <soCalled>Saltpetre Field,</soCalled> which name may
refer to the operations of Strode and Wandesforde in
the time of Charles I. There is also a <quote>Rugg Moor
and Lodge Field, in one,</quote> of 57 acres. The farm of
Mr. Richard Mortimer comprised 117 acres, and had on
it six cottages. One of Mr. Mortimer's fields was the
<soCalled>Nether Paddock,</soCalled> and another the <soCalled>Pound Field.</soCalled></p>
<p>  In the year before this survey was made, <date value="1793">1793</date>, an
architect named White, who was employed on the Portland estate, formed a plan for the improvement of
Marylebone Park.   Ideas had been entertained of
building over the whole space, but they were happily
abandoned, and when the leases fell in, there was no
difficulty in carrying out the great scheme which Nash
had elaborated on the lines of White. There is no
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> improvement more satisfactory than that by
which Regent Street, with its Quadrant, was made to
connect Pall Mall and Marylebone Park. A labyrinth
of miserable tenements had been allowed to grow up
between Golden Square and Burlington Gardens. Even
now, any one not very well acquainted with the region,
who gets entangled in the lanes about Broad Street or
Great Pulteney Street will find himself puzzled how to
get out again, and will have to breathe many strange
odours, and walk in not very select company. There
is, in fact, within a stone's throw of the finest street in
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> a territory which looks as if it properly belonged
to Whitechapel or Wapping. The maps of sixty years
ago show in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, just between Sackville Street on
the west and Air Street on the east, a little lane called
Swallow Street, and a court called Vine Street. Striking
boldly through the continuation of these thoroughfares,






                 <pb n="129" id="p.129"/>

Nash made Regent Street parallel with the upper course
of Swallow Street, which was in great part obliterated,
and he connected his new street with Waterloo Place by
the Quadrant, already referred to, which occupies the
site of a lane called Marybone Street. The Regent's
Park had by this time been laid out, much as we still see
it. The rows of stucco terraces called after the royal
dukes had been built, and the Zoological and Botanic
Gardens established.</p>
<p>  Regent's Park is the largest of these <soCalled>lungs of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>,</soCalled> as it covers 470 acres. <quote>The centre is to a
great extent an open green plain, free almost from
trees.</quote><note place="foot" n="29">Cole's 'Royal Parks,' p. 36.</note>  I have already<note place="foot" n="30">Vol. i., chap. i.</note>  described the course of the
Tyburn through it. An artificial lake has been made,
compared sometimes in shape to the three legs on the
shield of Man, and producing with its well-wooded
banks a charming effect. Two or three private villas do
not mar the view, though as they were all built as much
in a  <soCalled>Grecian</soCalled>  style as stucco and paint would permit,
they are not remarkable for picturesqueness. St. Dunstan's Villa was designed by Decimus Burton for the
marquis of Hertford. It derives its name from a singular
whim of that nobleman. When he was a child, and a
good child, his nurse to reward him would take him to
see the giants at St. Dunstan's, the old church in Fleet
Street, where the hours were struck on a bell by two
automatons. He used to say that when he grew to be
a man he would buy those giants.  <quote>It happened when
old St. Dunstan's was pulled down that the giants
were put up to auction, and bought by the marquis out
of old associations.</quote><note place="foot" n="31">Cunningham, ii. 696.</note>   They still mark time in the

<p>  In <date value="1863">1863</date>, an Italian garden was laid out in the park,
by Mr. Nesfield, under the direction of lord Mount
Temple, who was at that time chief commissioner of the
Board of Works. Great pains have been taken to choose
plants and flowers which will flourish in spite of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>
smoke, and the result is most satisfactory, the rhododendrons in particular, and some formal rows of poplars,
bearing the trial admirably.  In fact, it is curious to
contrast the flourishing condition of the vegetable
kingdom in this heavy clay with the effect produced on
animal life. The situation of the Zoological Gardens is
unfortunate. A large number of animals die annually,
and others go blind, and suffer from various diseases on
account of the unfavourable nature of the soil. It would
be difficult to suggest a better place. The gardens are
in so central a position that they may be and are daily
visited both from the eastern and western extremities of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>; but there can be little question that a saving,
not only of money, but of suffering, would result if
they could be removed to a sandy, or even a gravelly
soil.</p>
<p>  Very pretty views are to be had from the Zoological
Gardens, and other places, where there are bridges up
and down the Regent's Canal. It is now almost abandoned by traffic, and the long narrow reaches overhung
with heavy foliage afford probably the most completely
rural effects to be seen so near the great city. Little as
is the traffic now, during the passage under one of the
bridges of a gunpowder barge, in <date value="1876">1876</date>, an explosion
took place which shook all <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. The scene on the
following morning in the neighbourhood was not one to
be easily forgotten. Houses were wrecked as if they had
been built of playing cards. There was not a whole
pane of glass left in some score of streets. Even trees







                  <pb n="131" id="p.131"/>

and shrubs had been shattered. One trembles to think
of what might have happened had the explosion taken
place a little nearer to the menagerie ; the animals killed
and the animals let loose would alike have been the
cause of dire loss and confusion.</p>
<p>   New as it is, the Regent's Park boasts of the presence
of one of the oldest charitable institutions in the kingdom. St. Katharine's Hospital formerly stood in a very
different place. There was a small piece of low lying
ground beyond the Tower of London, in the Portsoken,
and therefore the property of the canons of Holy Trinity
at Aldgate on the hill above.  Here queen Matilda, the
wife of king Stephen, who is not to be confused with
Matilda or Maude, the wife of Henry I., and the founder
of the Priory at Aldgate, in the year <date value="1148">1148</date>, established on
this spot a hospital, which was to consist of a master,
certain brethren, and as many sisters, but how many does
not clearly appear. Their chief duty was to pray for the
queen's soul, and for the souls of her son and her
daughter. She placed the hospital under the special
care of the canons, whose lands she had obtained by an
exchange, and all went well till <date value="1255">1255</date>, when a most
curious transaction took place. We know but little about
the private character of Eleanor, the queen of Henry III.,
and that little does not prepossess us in her favour. She
was hated in the city; owing to her neglect London
Bridge was in danger of complete ruin;<note place="foot" n="32">See above, vol. i. p. 152.</note>  and the
slaughter of the citizens at Lewes by her son <soCalled>Sir
Edward le Fitzroy,</soCalled> did not, we may be sure, tend to
endear her in their minds. Queen Eleanor, for some
reason which history has failed to preserve, cast a
covetous eye on the foundation of queen Matilda, and
made a perfectly unfounded claim, through her chaplain,





<pb n="132" id="p.132"/>

to the custody of the hospital. The canons of Aldgate
had long declined from their pristine piety, and were now
chiefly remarkable for their enormous wealth. One of
them, on some complaint of drunkenness against the
master of queen Matilda's hospital, had been appointed
to supersede him; and that the prior and his canons
had a right to make the appointment was upheld by
the unanimous judgment of the barons of the exchequer.</p>
<p>  Nothing daunted by this defeat, queen Eleanor went
another way to work. She invoked the assistance of
Fulk Basset, then bishop of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, and a warm partisan
of the court faction. Bishop Basset inquired by what
right the prior and the canons appointed to the mastership. They replied, of course, that the hospital stood on
their land, that they had other and similar institutions to
which they appointed, and that, moreover, they had
received a gift of this hospital from the founder. The
bishop took little notice of the validity of this claim. He
appears wisely to have given no reasons for his decision,
but he simply removed the canon-master, inhibited the
brethren and sisters from obeying the prior, and appointed one of the brethren to be head of the hospital.
Fulk Basset died in <date value="1261">1261</date>, without having further arranged
for the acknowledgment of queen Eleanor's preposterous
aggression, but his successor, Wingham, compelled the
prior and canons to make a formal act of resignation to
the queen, threatening them with Henry's displeasure if
they refused, and assuring them that the king's will was
the law of the land.</p>
<p>  After these high-handed proceedings, queen Eleanor
entered on undisturbed possession, and held her Naboth's
vineyard of St. Katharine's for twelve years, when, in
spite of the entreaties of the pope, that she would restore
it to the prior and canons, she absolutely suppressed






                     <pb n="133" id="p.133"/>

and dissolved it, and in <date value="1273">1273</date>, made an entirely new
foundation on the site, appointing a master, and fixing
the number of inmates at twenty-two; namely, three
priests, three sisters, ten poor women, and six poor
scholars. Queen Philippa augmented the charity, and
so it remained, spared even at the reformation, on the
intercession, it was said, of queen Anne Boleyn.<note place="foot" n="33">There is a very full account of old St. Katharine's in Nichols's
  'Bibliotheca,' with a plan and several views.
</note></p>
<p>  In the reign of queen Elizabeth a layman, Thomas
Wylson, her secretary, was appointed master, and it soon
became evident that he proposed to deal with the estates
very much as his contemporary, Thurland, was dealing
with those of the Savoy. But the inhabitants of the
precinct, who derived innumerable benefits from the
presence among them of so wealthy and benevolent a
body, petitioned Cecil strongly against Wylson's proposed dissipation of the revenues of the hospital, and
succeeded in putting a stop to his negotiations with the
lord mayor for a sale of the franchises of the precinct.
Great numbers of foreigners, chiefly religious refugees,
resided here at the time, Dutch, French, Danes, Poles,
and Scots. The buildings can never have been very
handsome, and in <date value="1734">1734</date> were much injured by a fire. In
<date value="1751">1751</date>, the old house of the masters, which was built of
wood, was removed as threatening to become ruinous;
and a few years later the cloisters and the houses of the
brethren were likewise pulled down, so that in <date value="1779">1779</date>, when
Nichols's view was taken, little except the venerable
chapel remained of the original buildings. Sir Julius
Caesar, who was master in the early part of the reign of
James I., had repaired and beautified it, and had presented
a pulpit which still exists at Regent's Park. It bears a
quaint inscription from Nehemiah,  <quote>Ezra the scribe stood






<pb n="134" id="p.134"/>

upon a pulpit of wood which he had made for the
preacher.</quote><note place="foot" n="34">Nichols gives views and details of this pulpit in a series of eight
plates.</note> The tomb of John Holland, duke of Exeter,
and his two wives was removed at the same time, and a
building erected in the Regent's Park in the style of
gothic which might be expected from the date, <date value="1827">1827</date>. A
dock company envied the old site, and the brethren and
sisters were removed from what might have been and
had been a sphere of usefulness, to grace the new park
and impart an air of antiquity and respectability to the
pet scheme of George IV. The hospital has resisted all
projects of reform, and cannot now be said to serve any
very good purpose, except perhaps to enable the queen
to pension off a meritorious servant or a superannuated
foreign chaplain.</p>
<p>  To the north of Regent's Park, were Barrow Hill and
Primrose Hill. Barrow Hill has disappeared, but its
companion remains, the only example of the kind near
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>. It is kept open, and is laid out in walks. The
view from the summit on a clear day is not only beautiful
but interesting, and well repays one for the slight fatigue
of making the ascent.</p>
<p>  Of the other parks of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> there is not very much
to be said. I shall notice Battersea in its geographical
position.<note place="foot" n="35">See below, chap. xxii.</note>   Hornsey Wood has somewhat absurdly been
renamed Finsbury Park, although it is more than three

<p>
THE occasion which William the Conqueror seized for
building the Tower has been already described.<note place="foot" n="1">See above, vol. i. chapter iv.</note> The
situation, close by the river's bank, favours the supposition
that a part at least of the ground within the precinct was
reckoned royal property as foreshore. But another part
was undoubtedly taken from the citizens, and the circuit
of the city walls was broken.  It has recently been
ascertained, not only that a considerable quantity of
Roman brick was used in the buildings, but that the
foundation of the White Tower itself overlies that of a
great and solid bastion. When Gray therefore talked of
the <quote>towers of Julius,</quote> he was not so very far wrong as
has sometimes been thought. Had he said <quote>towers of
Caesar,</quote> there would have been little fault to find.</p>
<p>  While the western half of the tower precinct thus
belongs to the ancient circuit of the city, the eastern
half belongs to the original parish of <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName>. It is
perhaps on this account that the parliamentary borough
which has been formed of the parish is called, not
Stepney, but, somewhat absurdly, the  <soCalled>Tower Hamlets.</soCalled>
The boundaries of the precinct are very sharply defined,
and for many ages the city looked with great jealousy at
any encroachment. When Edward IV., for example,
set up the gallows on Tower Hill, the citizens immediately




      <pb n="137" id="p.137"/>

took alarm, and the jurisdiction of the sheriffs
was acknowledged by the king.</p>
<p>  In the reign of James I. a similar question arose, but
in this case the citizens were apparently the aggressors.
The lord mayor in <date value="1618">1618</date> ordered <quote>a prison or cage</quote> to
be constructed on Tower Hill. Sir Allen Apsley, who
was then lieutenant of the Tower, remonstrated in a
letter<note place="foot" n="2">'Remembrancia,' p. 442.</note> in which he pointed out that if the new building
could be removed a few yards it would stand within the
City boundary.  He uses the curious word <soCalled>disburbance</soCalled> with reference to the site chosen. It had too
much disburbance. As far back as the time of Elizabeth
a controversy sprung up between the lord mayor and
the lieutenant as to the removal of a boundary stone,
and as to the lord mayor's right to have the sword
borne before him upright until a certain point was
passed.<note place="foot" n="3">See 'Remembrancia,' passim.</note> </p>
 <p> The gradual growth of the buildings as we see them
now may be briefly traced. When William died the
works were far from complete. At the close of the
reign of Stephen there was only the White Tower within
its wall, forming what we now know as the inner ward,
the royal palace being on the south-east side.  <quote>No
doubt there was a ditch, but probably not a very formidable one.</quote><note place="foot" n="4">Clark, ' Old London,' 101.</note>   The outer ward was the creation of
Richard I. and his minister, William Longchamp, bishop
of Ely.<note place="foot" n="5">See vol. i. chapter v.</note> The bishop deepened and enlarged the ditch,
hoping to fill it from the Thames, an object in which,
however, he failed. In his excavations he encroached on
the land of the priory of Holy Trinity, <placeName key="Aldgate">Aldgate</placeName>, and on



<pb n="138" id="p.138"/>

that of St. Katharine's Hospital. These trespasses were
the cause of much complaint, which was not finally
allayed until Edward I. made compensation.  The
" royal chapel in the Tower" is mentioned in the records
of Longchamp's rule, and this may be the chapel of St.
Peter. King John spent much money in buildings, and
the chapel is distinctly mentioned in <date value="1210">1210</date>, when
Osmund, a knight bound for Poictou, received a gift of
ten marks, and, to buy a horse, a hundred shillings from
the king in the <quote>church of St. Peter at the Tower of
London.</quote></p>
<p>  But to Henry III. must be given the credit of having
made of the Tower the extensive fortification we now
see. At his accession the wall of the inner ward was
complete, but the quay along the river's edge, and the
water gate known as St. Thomas's Tower, had not been
constructed. The wall probably abutted on the water,
and the principal entrance was directly on the river.
The palace, or  <soCalled>king's house,</soCalled> was built before <date value="1222">1222</date>, and
the Bell Tower probably soon after, work going on constantly. There are many entries as to the making of a
chimney for the king's chamber, a piece of domestic
engineering which seems to have taxed the ability of the
builders. At this time the Wakefield Tower, which had
formed part of the Norman work, was raised and completed, and the  <soCalled>Bloody Tower</soCalled>  adjoining. Close to it
was the great hall of the palace, destroyed during the
Commonwealth. It is in the Wakefield Tower that the
modern visitor inspects the crown jewels, but it was long
used for the storage of records. Unfortunately the old
building has here been almost completely renewed, the
chapel-the third which is known to have existed in the
Tower of London-having been destroyed, not, indeed,
under the Commonwealth, but under the direction of the






   <pb n="139" id="p.139"/>

Office of Works. Here, in all probability, the unfortunate Henry VI. worshipped during a great part of his
long reign, and one cannot but regret to see that the
same want of consideration for ancient association is busy
in every part of the venerable fortress.</p>
<p>  In <date value="1240">1240</date>, Henry III., the new-built Traitor's Gate, or
Water Tower, fell down suddenly. It was rebuilt, and
again fell. No doubt the foundation in the bed of the
river was not sufficiently strong or deep. But superstition accounted for the two occurrences in a much more
satisfactory way. On the night of the second fall the
great Archbishop Thomas appeared to a certain priest
and told him that he resented these great works as prejudicial to the citizens.  Nevertheless, the king had
them renewed, and compounded with the saint by calling
the new tower after him. On this his sympathies with
the citizens ceased to agitate him. An oratory in the
upper storey, the fourth building of the kind, was
dedicated to St. Thomas of Canterbury.</p>
<p>  A good many of Henry III.'s descendants passed
through the archway, some of them under sad circumstances. We cannot forget the figure of the lady Elizabeth, who was sent to the Tower on the outbreak of
Wyatt's rebellion. When the boat came to the stair the
princess refused to land. The lord in charge of her
peremptorily told her she had no choice. It rained, and
he offered her his cloak, which she refused, <quote>putting it
from her with a good dash,</quote><note place="foot" n="6">' The Tower of London,' by Lord de Ros, 71.</note>  and as she set foot on the
steps she cried with momentary spirit,  <quote>Here landeth as
true a subject, being a prisoner, as ever landed at these
stairs.</quote> But her courage forsook her again when she
saw the guards drawn up to receive her. The soldiers
kneeled down as she passed, and prayed God bless her,




<pb n="140" id="p.140"/>

for which, it is said, they were all dismissed.  The princess, unwilling to go further through the gloomy portals,
sat down on a stone   in the  rain. The lieutenant
entreated her to rise and go on. <quote>Better sit here
than in a worse place,</quote> she answered, significantly.<note place="foot" n="7">Lord de Ros mentions a tradition to the effect that certain of the city
church bells having been rung on Elizabeth's release, she afterwards presented those churches with silken bell-ropes. He goes on to say that silken
ropes long existed in the vestry chest of  <quote>the church of Aldgate.</quote> This
may refer to St. Botolph's.</note></p>
<p>   The impression which St. Thomas's Tower used to
make on the visitor is now much weakened. The upper
storey consists of a new, nay, a novel building in the style
of a country cottage; and the water is no longer permitted to approach the steps. Few of the stones, if any,
that Elizabeth saw in <date value="1553">1553</date> are to be seen now. Everything has been <soCalled>restored.</soCalled></p>
<p>  Perhaps the most curious commitment was that of the
abbot of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, who, with forty-eight monks and
thirty-two other persons, was sent to the Tower by
Edward   I. on suspicion of having stolen the king's
treasure. The crime was brought home at last, after a
long trial, to the sub-prior and sacrist.<note place="foot" n="8">Stanley's 'Westminster Abbey,' chapter v.; and Scott's ' Gleanings,'
p. 283, where will be found an account of the trial by the late Mr. Burtt.</note>  Their skins
were nailed on the doors of the treasury and of the
sacristy, where they still remain, a warning to evil-doers.</p>
<p>  Edward III. did much for the Tower, which was the
site of a powder factory in <date value="1347">1347</date>, to the great danger of
the buildings, though, in all probability, the quality of
the explosive compound was not such as to make it very
formidable. There are entries in the records for saltpetre
and sulphur, <quote><foreign lang="LA">ad opus Regis pro gunnis.</foreign></quote></p>
<p>  In this reign, too, the Tower saw the first of a long line




   <pb n="141" id="p.141"/>

of royal prisoners. David, king of Scotland, taken at
Neville's Cross, was brought here to linger out eleven
years of captivity and ill-health. In <date value="1358">1358</date>, the then large
sum of 2&#x00A3;. 12s. 9d. was paid for his medicines. John of
France, Richard II., Henry VI., Edward V., queen
Anne Boleyn, queen Katherine Howard, queen Jane,
and queen Elizabeth, are among the royal personages in
the sad procession, but Charles I. was never confined in
the Tower.</p>
<p>  When James I. came to the throne the palace within
the Tower had fallen almost into ruin. According to one
account, he removed the great hall. In <date value="1663">1663</date> Wren was
commissioned to repair the White Tower, which he did
in a way worthy of a modern restorer, and only a few
traces remain of the old Norman windows.<note place="foot" n="9">I regret to hear that it is proposed to restore Wren's work. The
authorities who have charge of the Tower have no more reverence for
historical association than the dean and chapter of a gothic cathedral.</note>  In <date value="1841">1841</date> a
fire destroyed the armoury which Wren had built for
James II. and William III., and the painfully substantial
Wellington Barracks in a gothic style, as gothic was
then understood, were placed on the site. The Beauchamp Tower was <soCalled>restored</soCalled> in <date value="1854">1854</date>, and all traces of
antiquity carefully removed: the inscriptions on the
walls were taken down and placed together in one room,
so that they have lost half their interest and all their
historical value. During the past few years other changes
have taken place, of which it may safely be said that few
of them are improvements. The curious building, dating
from the reign of Edward III., which adjoined the eastern
side of the White Tower, has been removed, as have the
great stores which stood on the site of the old palace.<note place="foot" n="10">It is understood that a further <soCalled>falsification of the record</soCalled> is to be
carried out shortly by the erection of a building here which <quote>will
harmonise with its surroundings.</quote></note>



<pb n="142" id="p.142"/>

The interior of the White Tower still retains the fantastic
arrangements of old arms, but we no longer enter it
through a window, and <soCalled>Queen Elizabeth's Armoury</soCalled>
has become what it was before, the crypt of St. John's
Chapel. The chapel has been very thoroughly scraped,
renewed, paved, and otherwise robbed of any appearance
of age it had acquired in eight centuries. Something
has also been done with the long-ruined towers along the
quay. They were buried in modern buildings, and the
process of extrication has, of course, been accompanied
by great destructions. On the whole, however, this is
the most satisfactory of all the modern operations, and
the only one which has in any way added to our interest
in the Tower of London.</p>
<p>  The chapel of St. Peter's <soCalled>ad Vincula</soCalled> has suffered
more from <soCalled>restoration,</soCalled> than even the Beauchamp
Tower. It only dates from <date value="1512">1512</date>, when an older church
was burnt, and was still new when interments were first
made within its walls. Few churches have undergone
greater vicissitudes than St. Peter's. It may be described
as either a collegiate church, a parish church, a royal
chapel, or a garrison chapel. The intentions of Edward
III. to place it under a dean and three canons, were
never carried out. A similar scheme formed by Edward
IV. went further, but was eventually dropped. It has,
however, been continually served by a <soCalled>parson,</soCalled> whose
office, instituted perhaps when the church was first built,
has survived until now.  Even when the arrangements
for a college were in progress, the parson of St. Peter
existed, and in <date value="1419">1419</date> gave very powerful proof of his
existence when he slew a certain Friar Randolph, as
Stow tells us without further comment. Philip and
Mary found  <quote>no parson abyde to have cure sowle,</quote> and








   <pb n="143" id="p.143"/>

declared their royal pleasure <quote>the same to be established
into perfecyon.</quote><note place="foot" n="11">' The Chapel in the Tower,' by D. C. Bell, p. 6. Mr. Bell carefully
and approvingly details the vandalism and sacrilege which were perpetrated in <date value="1876">1876</date> and the following year.</note></p>
<p>  The position of the Tower parson is, nevertheless still
anomalous. The bishop has no jurisdiction within the
precincts, says one authority.<note place="foot" n="12">Mr. Bell.</note>  Godwin and Britton
report that it is under the control of the bishop of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>,
which is probably correct; but Bayley calls it a chapelry,
and in the next line speaks of <quote>the chaplain or rector.</quote>
archbishop  Whitgift   and   his   successor <quote>would    not
meddle with it,</quote> but archbishop Abbot excommunicated
<quote>the rector and his son, the curate</quote> for solemnising
marriages without license. The reader turns with
satisfaction to the precise statement of Newcourt.<note place="foot" n="13">i. 530. Mr. Bell's assertion that this arrangement was abrogated
<quote>upon the establishment of the Protestant succession in the following
reign,</quote> is somewhat puzzling. What Protestant succession did Elizabeth
establish ? And what abrogation was ever formally made ? There cannot,
in short, be any reason for doubting that the chaplaincy is of the nature of
a perpetual curacy in the diocese of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. The constable is the
patron. The stipend is paid by the Exchequer.</note>   The
chapel was formerly exempt from the jurisdiction of the
bishop of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, but Edward VI., by letters patent
dated 1 April, <date value="1550">1550</date>, subjected it to  the episcopal
supervision, and this order was confirmed by queen
Mary, on the 2nd March, <date value="1554">1554</date>. <quote>But,</quote> adds the
judicious  Newcourt,    <quote>whether    ever any    bishop   of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>, did by virtue of these letters exercise any
jurisdiction within the Tower, I have not found.</quote></p>
<p>  We have all read and reread the affecting words in
which Stow notices the chapel.  <quote>Here lieth before the
high altar in St. Peter's church, two dukes between two





<pb n="144" id="p.144"/>

queens, to wit, the duke of Somerset, and the duke of
Northumberland, between queen Anne and queen
Katherine, all four beheaded.</quote> We have also read
Macaulay's comment. <quote>Thither have been carried
through successive ages, by the rude hands of gaolers,
without one mourner following, the bleeding relics of
men who had been the captains of armies, the leaders
of parties, the oracles of senates, and the ornaments of
courts.</quote> Nothing can add to the mournful interest of
the place; and though we must sympathise in the
indignation which Macaulay expressed against the
<quote>barbarous stupidity</quote>  which had transformed the chapel

been one which removed the seats and galleries, and
which left undisturbed the sacred ashes under the floor.
The reredos was ugly, but it had seen the burial of the
Scots lords, and perhaps of Monmouth. It was much
more appropriate than the fine new one, which, if it was
really what it pretends to be, of the fourteenth century,
would be 200 years older than the church in which it
stands. A church built in <date value="1512">1512</date> would almost certainly
have had a renaissance reredos, if any.<note place="foot" n="14">Mr. Doyne Bell mentions the resolution of the committee who

of it, to remove the ancient stones, to sift the earth, to
re-arrange and classify the bones, and, in a word, to ruin
the historical associations of this most sacred spot.  A
gaudy inlaid pavement bears the names, worked into
ornamental patterns, of the nobles and ladies whose dust
was so sacrilegiously disturbed; and the church itself, if
it once resembled a Methodist now resembles much
more a Congregational meeting house, and the  <soCalled>original

<p>  Before the building of the Record Office in Fetter
Lane, the national archives were deposited in the Tower.
Latterly the accumulation was so great that not the
chapel in the White Tower only, but several other
buildings, as the Wakefield and Bloody Towers, for
example, were filled with documents.  The chancery
records were kept here at a very early period.<note place="foot" n="15">The name of William Lamhith, clerk of the works, is on record as

He was succeeded by Prynne, who though he had
suffered so much under Charles I., was a promoter of the
restoration of Charles II. Astle, who wrote the history
of writing, also held the office, but the greatest of the
keepers was Samuel Lysons, to whom, and to his brother
Daniel, modern topographers are so deeply indebted.
Under his supervision the systematic calendaring was
commenced, and the names of Sir Harris Nicolas and
Sir Francis Palgrave may be mentioned among those
who have carried on the great work inaugurated by
Lysons.</p>
<p>  A different kind of interest attaches to the Tower
menagerie, the nucleus of the great collection now in the
gardens of the Zoological Society in Regent's Park.
<soCalled>Seeing the lions in the Tower</soCalled> has become a proverb.
People who visit the ancient fortress now do not go to
study natural history, but <soCalled>seeing the lions</soCalled> is still the
phrase employed. The first wild beasts were kept in the
Tower almost as soon as it was built.<note place="foot" n="18">' The Tower Menagerie,' with cuts, by William Harvey, published

collection of lions, leopards, and other strange animals.
Three leopards, in allusion perhaps to the royal heraldry,
were presented to Henry III. by the emperor Frederick II. This king indulged his zoological tastes at

to have been in so many other respects. The sheriffs
had to arrange in <date value="1252">1252</date> for the safe-keeping of a white

the Thames."<note place="foot" n="19">Clark, 'Old London,' p.96></note>  Two years later an elephant arrived

and to support him and his keeper. <quote>At the time when
the allowance for an esquire was one penny a day,</quote>
remarks Mr. Clark, <quote>a lion had a quarter of mutton
and three halfpence for the keeper; and afterwards six-
pence was the lion's allowance; the same for a leopard,
and three halfpence for the keeper.</quote>  In the reign of
Henry VI., the office of keeper was held by men of
superior rank, and sometimes by the lieutenant of the
Tower. In <date value="1543">1543</date> the collection consisted of four large
lions and two leopards. In <date value="1657">1657</date> there were six lions in
the Tower, and by <date value="1708">1708</date>, the list of wild beasts had
increased to eleven lions, two leopards or tigers, three
eagles, two owls, two cats of the mountain and a jackal.<note place="foot" n="20">'Tower Menagerie,' p. xv.</note>
Fifty years later the menagerie attained very large
dimensions.  Maitland<note place="foot" n="21">'History of London,' i. 172. His list commences with <quote>Two

an ape, specially interested him. It could throw stones
with surprising strength and accuracy, and seems to have
been deemed most valuable on account of its having
killed a boy by throwing a cannon-ball at him. It had
many other actions <quote>nearly approaching to those of the
human species.</quote> Among other wonderful animals was
a golden eagle which had been in captivity more than
ninety years. There was only one lion, Pompey, and
one lioness, Helen.  After this period the collection
dwindled, and in <date value="1822">1822</date>, when Mr. Cops became the

<p>  The Lion Tower was an outwork in advance of the
Middle Tower, now the principal entrance for visitors.
It stood on the site of the present ticket office, and had
a smaller tower adjoining it, and a drawbridge of its own.<note place="foot" n="23">It may be seen on the extreme left-or west--of the accompanying
view.</note>
The whole of the outer space was called the Bulwark,
and sometimes Spur Yard. Close to it was the sluice by
which water was admitted to the Tower Ditch. During
a visitation of cholera, in <date value="1854">1854</date>, the death of lord Jocelyn,
then on duty at the Tower with his regiment, called
attention to the unwholesomeness of the great surface of
stagnant water, and the duke of Wellington ordered it
to be drained.  The bottom  was partially filled and
levelled so as to form a parade ground, and the sloping
sides, north and west, were laid out with shrubs and
walks, and surrounded by a railing. A curious accident
happened here some years later, but escaped public
notice. A fire-engine driven at great speed to the succour of a conflagration at St. Katherine's Dock beyond
the Tower, emerged from Tower Street, and in the darkness was dashed against the railings. Engine, horses,
and men fell headlong into the ditch, yet, strange to say,
the engine only was injured.</p>
<p>  Of all the manors connected with St. Paul's, Stepney
was the greatest, and we have now to tell the story
of its alienation and disintegration. A little further on
a similar story will be concerned with the estates of the

prebendaries or canons of the cathedral church. If the
abbot of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> had the manor of St. Margaret's,
extending west from the wall to <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, the bishop of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> had a counter-balancing estate in the east: for
<placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName> extended from Aldgate to the Lea, and from
the Thames to the northern hills. In Domesday the
bishop's holding is set down at thirty-two hides, and he
had besides eight tenants, some of whom held as much
as five hides. One of them was Engelbric, a canon of
St. Paul's, and another William, the chamberlain, presumably of the city, whom we have had occasion to
notice more than once.</p>
<p>  This great estate comprised at least seven different
modern parishes and innumerable smaller ecclesiastical
divisions, being in fact itself the district so often referred
to as the great and terrible  <soCalled>east end.</soCalled> Whitechapel
was the first district separated.  An ancient church,
whose name, " St. Mary Matfelon," has been the subject
of some wild guessing, had subsisted here-as St.
Clement Danes had subsisted on the manor of the abbot
of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>-from time immemorial. The rector of
Stepney had the gift of the living in the time of Stow,
but since the beginning of the eighteenth century even
this connection with the mother parish has been severed
and the advowson is now held by an Oxford College.
The church was recently pulled down, and a new one in
a very florid style of gothic built, but almost immediately
burnt. It is now being rebuilt.</p>
<p>  <placeName key="Shadwell">Shadwell</placeName> was separated in the reign of Charles II. by
Act of Parliament, when the church, also probably an old
chapel of ease, was consecrated as St. Paul's, the gift
being in the dean and chapter of the cathedral. One by
one after this, <soCalled>Wapping in the Wash,</soCalled> Spitalfields,
Limehurst, Stratford, and Bethnal Green have followed,







<pb n="150" id="p.150"/>

and the mother church has now but a moderate district
left.</p>
<p>  The dedication to St. Dunstan is almost manifestly
later than the church itself; and we find, accordingly,
" All Saints " added to the English archbishop, and even
in some authorities an assertion that to them alone the
parish was originally assigned. The old church has been
much molested, but is the old church still, and contains
a fine series of ancient monuments. So far back as the
beginning of the last century the fame of Stepney in this
respect had penetrated westward, and we find its
epitaphs quoted in both the ' Spectator' and the 'Tatler.'
Built into the west porch is a stone carved with an
inscription commencing, <quote>Of Carthage wall I was a
stone,</quote> and signed, <quote>Thomas Hughes, <date value="1663">1663</date>.</quote> It may
very well have been brought by a traveller from the
African ruins.<note place="foot" n="24">It was just twenty years after that Mr. Huntingdon brought home
from Egypt to Oxford the oldest monument now in England. See
'Catalogue,' Ashmolean Museum, No. 794.</note> The fine houses which once surrounded
the church have all perished; the neighbourhood is composed of very miserable tenements.   Pace, who succeeded Colet, first at Stepney and afterwards at St. Paul's,
was the well-known diplomatist, one of Wolsey's
favourite tools, especially in his intrigues for the papal
crown.<note place="foot" n="25">See ' Handbook to St. Paul's,' pp. 156-168, for notices of Colet and
Pace.</note> </p>
<p>  Of the other churches in this vast parish it would be
impossible to give a detailed account. With one exception, all were in the classical style, until St. Philip's was
built in <date value="1829">1829</date>, the first example of the gothic revival; but
one old gothic church survived, namely, at Stratford, near
the "Bow " or arched bridge over the Lea, a chapelry of




  <pb n="151" id="p.151"/>

Stepney till <date value="1719">1719</date>, when it was made parochial. It retains
many pointed features, and is mainly as it was when
built in the fifteenth century.  It stands well in the
middle of <soCalled>the king's highway,</soCalled> on a site specially
granted by bishop Baldock.  St. George's-in-the-East
has superseded the old name of Wapping, which now
only belongs to a small riverside district, the church of
which, perfectly modern, is dedicated to St. John. St.
George's was designed by Hawksmoor, the pupil of
Wren. It was one of the fifty parish churches of queen
Anne's time, but was not finished and consecrated till
<date value="1729">1729</date>.  Limehouse, formerly Limehurst, was made
parochial in <date value="1730">1730</date>, and the dedication of the church to
St. Anne was probably intended as a compliment to the
queen. It also was designed by Hawksmoor, but cannot
be considered a favourable example of his powers. In
St. George's and St. Anne's he appears in fact to have
been trying experiments in a style already bound down
by hard-and-fast rules. If we judge him by St. Mary
Woolnoth, or St. George's Bloomsbury, we may think he
approached very near to his master Wren: but these
conspicuous riverside churches show that his genius was
limited. Architects have been slow to learn, if indeed
they have ever learnt, that eccentricity is not necessarily
picturesque, while it is often unpleasing. Vanbrugh, who
went even farther than Hawksmoor in this direction,
succeeded more often, yet his best works are those in
which he adhered most strictly to the conventional rules.
Of St. George's-in-the-East there is not much to be said.
Its tower is a monument of ugliness well known to any
one who has occasion to go up or down the Thames
below <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. It is 160 ft. in height, and bears a little
spire and weather-cock rising from among eight objectless columns. The interior is spacious, but insufficiently








<pb n="152" id="p.152"/>

lighted, and the construction is so ingeniously concealed
as to excite a feeling of insecurity very much out of place
in ecclesiastical architecture.</p>
<p>  <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName>, like <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, at the time of the Conquest
and long after, was a centre of fashion. Domesday Book
contains a list of the bishop's tenants, from which we
gather that some great men of the court, some of the
city, and some of the church lived here, though it would
be difficult to identify their holdings. Ralf Flambard
must have overshadowed the bishop himself.          Hugh
Berners was a Norman noble.     William de Vere became
the progenitor of the long and illustrious line of the earls
of Oxford. Beside the bishop of Lisieux and several
canons of St. Paul's, there were some eminent citizens-
Roger, the sheriff,<note place="foot" n="26">He was probably sheriff of Middlesex, but he may have been sheriff of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>. The Essex sheriff seems to have been Sweyn. On the whole it
seems likely that  <quote>Rogerius, vicecomes,</quote> as he is described in the MS.,
was not the successor of Gosfrith, to whom the charter had been granted,
as <quote>the title of William the Chamberlain</quote> seems to answer best to that of
<quote>Portreeve.</quote></note>  for example, and William, the chamberlain. These great persons probably lived either about
<placeName key="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</placeName>, outside the wall, or at <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName> itself, near
the church of St. Dunstan. One or two of the holdings
may still be identified.  In the same paragraph with the
bishop's home manor the estate of a canon of St. Paul's
is described. This was probably Holywell or Finsbury,
since the bishop's house was north of the city and near
Bethnal Green. Sired, a canon, held it in the days of
king Edward, and could sell or lease it. Another prebendal manor is mentioned, and as it is in the same
paragraph, it was presumably at the same place, and
would answer to the modern stall of <soCalled>Ealdland.</soCalled><note place="foot" n="27">See above, chapter i. p. 4. Neither Holywell nor Ealdland is
mentioned by name in Domesday.</note>      A





                 <pb n="153" id="p.153"/>

third estate was the property of  <quote>Engelbric, a canon,</quote>
presumably of St. Paul's. He could not sell it, and it
was probably not one of the prebendal manors. In a
humbler walk of life we find Doding, the miller, who
held a <quote>virgate</quote>  of the bishop's own manor, and who
seems to be commemorated in the name of " Dodding
Pond," in East Smithfield.<note place="foot" n="28">'Steven's Continuation of Dugdale,' p. 83.</note></p>
<p>  The bishop's manor house was at Bethnal Green. Its
site, close to the western entrance of Victoria Park, is
still indicated by some of the local names, such as
Bishop's Road, Bonner's Road, and Hall Bridge. Names
alone are ancient now in this quarter. All else is modern
and moreover shabby. The Beggar's Daughter has
multiplied a hundred thousand fold. Only public houses
and pawnbrokers' shops seem to flourish, everything else
has an air of poverty, which here and there puts on a
still more melancholy look of gentility. There are a few
private houses, surrounded by straggling gardens, and
coarse weedy grass. There are great hospitals, one of
which occupies part of the site of the bishop's manor
house. There are some modern churches built in the
early years of the gothic revival, and the handsome, if
useless Columbia Market,<note place="foot" n="29">Intended by lady Burdett-Coutts for a local market, but, perhaps,
too good for the place, and a failure. The architect was Mr. Darbishire, and
the building cost about 200,000&#x00A3;.</note> looks strange and out of
place in all its finery of pinnacles. An occasional board
school rises above the low roofs and looks pleasant and
pretty by contrast.</p>
<p>  There is an old Joe Miller about Bethnal Green which
used to puzzle commentators. It related to some coarse
joke made by Rochester or Charles II. as to a causeway
constructed of the skulls and horns of cattle which







<pb n="154" id="p.154"/>

here carried the Newmarket road across a marsh. The
citizens it was said, laid their heads together to form
the road. At the present day the marsh is drained, and
there are many roads in the district and many streets,
but very few breathing spaces.</p>
<p>  In one of them stands the museum, conspicuous
among the east end buildings as the only example of
what future ages may call the South Kensington style
of architecture. The pilgrim from the west end if he is
not very young may see another memento of Brompton
in the majolica fountain which was so conspicuous an
object in the exhibition of <date value="1862">1862</date>. The raw colours are
as bright, as inharmonious as ever. Glazed pottery,
indeed, enjoys perpetual youth. The interior of the
museum is more pleasing: the specimens of manufacture of different kinds being well arranged, and loan
collections of china and pictures being constantly on
view.</p>
<p>  Before bishop Ridley surrendered <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName> to Edward
VI., or rather to the greedy courtier who coveted it,
the manor house had seen some very fine company at
times. There is not much to connect Bonner with it
during his first incumbency of the see, but before him
several bishops had made it an occasional residence.
Braybrook, who was chancellor of England in the
beginnings of troubles under Richard II., found it
convenient to live for months together half-way as it
were between town and country. The hunting grounds
of Hornsey and Highgate with their woods stretched
away over the hills towards the great forest on one side,
the busy city that, literally, <quote>kings and priests were
plotting in,</quote> was close by on the other. Before Braybrook, another chancellor, Baldock, was much at Bethnal
Green, and died here in <date value="1313">1313</date>. Bishop Roger the Black






  <pb n="155" id="p.155"/>

(cognomine Niger) died here in <date value="1241">1241</date>. But after the
grant of Stepney to lord Wentworth the house declined.
We seek in vain for any vestiges of it. A century ago
it was divided into tenements.  Hospitals, asylums,
streets and squares cover all the bishop's land.</p>
<p>  Near the church of St. Dunstan was another old house.
In <date value="1299">1299</date> Edward I. held a parliament in Stepney at the
house of the mayor of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, Henry le Waleys. The
mayor's country villa must have been a palace. Its
exact site is not certain, but it was probably the same as
that occupied by mayor Pulteney in <date value="1330">1330</date>. He was the
representative of a great city family still commemorated
in St. Lawrence  <soCalled>Pountney,</soCalled> one of whom at a much
later period was an eminent statesman, and earl of Bath.
Sir Henry Colet, the father of dean Colet, had a house
here also, probably the same; it stood a little west of the
church<note place="foot" n="30">Lysons, ii. 685.</note>  and was known as the Great Place. Some
fragments were still to be seen in the present century.
The monument of Sir Henry Colet, repeatedly restored,
is in the church. It is the special care of the Mercer's
Company. The house which Sir Henry left to the
company, was by them leased to the great vicar-general,
Cromwell, earl of Essex. Colet's son, the celebrated
dean, was vicar of the parish. It is seldom that so many
great associations cluster round one such place. Here
More and Erasmus must have visited Colet-whether in
the vicarage, or at his father's house-and there are
many allusions to the place in their letters. He died in
<date value="1519">1519</date>, and so did not witness the reign of terror under
which More lost his head, nor did he see his father's
house desecrated by the presence of Cromwell. When
Cromwell in his turn was attainted the lease of Stepney
was allowed to descend to his nephew, Sir Richard







<pb n="156" id="p.156"/>

Williams, who assuming the surname, became an ancestor
of the Lord Protector.</p>
<p>  Stepney was privileged to have both a rector and a
vicar. The rectory was a sinecure, but the rector
nominated the vicar who paid him the rent of a red rose
for the vicarage house. Colet was not rector, as he is
sometimes called, but vicar: he lived in a house of his
own, which he bequeathed to St. Paul's School, as a
villa for the <soCalled>High Master.</soCalled> Its site is marked by
Colet Place. Pace, the friend of Erasmus, succeeded
Colet as vicar of Stepney, and after some years, also as
dean of St. Paul's. Rectory and vicarage have long been
united, and the living is now in private patronage.<note place="foot" n="31">The gift is in the Tyssen-Amherst family.</note></p>
<p>  The greater part of the manor of <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName> must,
however, have been very little better than a fen until a
comparatively late period. We find a prioress of St.
Helen's just before the Dissolution granting a lease of
land in Stepney called Hare Marsh; and even so late
as the time of Stow, much of the parish was completely
open. There were fair hedges, he tells us, and long
rows of elms and other trees. The name of Wapping
may be that of a Saxon mark, but the old addition
<quote>in the Wose,</quote> or wash, sufficiently indicates its condition.<note place="foot" n="32">The  <soCalled>Wap Ing</soCalled>  may have been a meadow by the river.</note>  Nightingale Lane, Bramley, Ratcliffe (said to
have been called from a bank of red clay), Limehurst,
and other rural names occur by the river's edge. But
already in the middle of the sixteenth century, the
houses were springing up. The old place for the execution of pirates was at Wapping <quote>at the low water mark,
there to remain, till three tides had overflowed them.</quote><note place="foot" n="33">A similar custom existed in the liberty of Castle Baynard.</note>
Here, says Stow, there was never a house standing




   <pb n="157" id="p.157"/>

within these forty years. He is writing in <date value="1603">1603</date>, and
adds that since the gallows have been removed further
off, there has been <quote>a continual street, or filthy strait
passage, with alleys of small tenements, or cottages, built,
inhabited by sailors' victuallers, along by the river of
Thames.</quote> This district, which began at the Tower with
East Smithfield, was known as Ratcliffe Highway. Of
late it has been called St. George Street, the name of
Ratcliffe, except in the vulgar tongue, has disappeared,
and Wapping is restricted to the corner cut off between
the river's bank and the docks. These docks commence
on the site of St. Katharine's Hospital, and are continued
as London Dock, and Shadwell Basin right across the
peninsula. To the north of them runs the highway so
feelingly described by Stow; it is continued east until
it becomes High Street Shadwell, and is finally lost near
Limehouse Basin. Further inland is a vast thoroughfare, entirely modern, known as Commercial Road; and
still further north, the old thoroughfare, leading to
Stratford and its bridge over the Lea.  The whole
district is a labyrinth of small houses, and sustains an
enormous population, almost entirely employed in docks,
breweries, match factories, and other establishments of
the kind. The efforts which have been made, by such
institutions as the Bethnal Green Museum  and the
public libraries, to influence these people have had a fair
measure of success, and deserve more than a passing
mention, if only because of the amount of wholly disinterested labour which has been bestowed upon them

<p>   The bishop of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> has still the gift of a majority
of the livings in this immense parish, but he is no
longer lord of the manor of Stepney. In <date value="1550">1550</date>, Nicholas
Ridley, then bishop, and afterwards martyr, surrendered






<pb n="158" id="p.158"/>

it to Edward VI., and for the last time we may connect
<placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName> with <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. Both the abbot's house and
the bishop's manor were conferred on lord Wentworth.
He retained his hold on Stepney, even during queen
Mary's reign, and his descendants till <date value="1720">1720</date> were reckoned
lords of a manor which included all the modern Tower
Hamlets, except the Tower itself, and a small portion
of <placeName key="Hackney">Hackney</placeName>, which having been alienated during the
Commonwealth was never restored. A wealthy merchant named Daniel bought much property in the
parish. Another named Tyssen imitated his example,
and by degrees the greater part of the original manor
was acquired by one family or the other. A union took
place between them by marriage, and their present
representative may be looked upon as lord of the manor,
since he has not only the land as the Wentworths had
it, but also the advowson of the church. There is on
record a curious protest of the Heralds College against
the unauthorised pomp of the funeral of Mr. Francis
Tyssen of <placeName key="Hackney">Hackney</placeName> in <date value="1717">1717</date>. He was a goldsmith and
his body lay in state at Goldsmiths' Hall, and was conveyed at night with a great torchlight procession to its
last resting place. The heralds issued an advertisement
in the Gazette, censuring  <quote>the manner in which the body
was set forth,</quote> as being far above <quote>the quality of the
deceased.</quote><note place="foot" n="34">See a similar case under " Battersea," chapter xxii.</note> Two or three days after this great ceremony
Tyssen's widow was delivered of a son, who eventually
inherited the estate.</p>
<p>  <placeName key="Hackney">Hackney</placeName>, which forms the chief part of the Tyssen
estate, lies at the northern extremity of the old manor
of <placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName>. In the marshes of the Lea there was
from time immemorial a village named Hackney
Wick. It was on an island or  <soCalled>ey</soCalled>  of the river named





   <pb n="159" id="p.159"/>

in all probability after some Danish Hacon who settled
there. Various neighbouring landowners acquired tracts
of marsh land, as the wide-spreading waters were
gradually canalised or banked up, and eventually the
bishops, the Knights Templars, the hospital of St. Mary,
(called St. Mary Spital) outside Bishopsgate, and the
priory of <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName>, had all estates here, each of which
was reputed a manor. In addition Hoxton, previously
Hoggeston, and in Domesday Hochestone, was a manor
of the canons of St. Paul's, really owned by the Aspale
family in the fourteenth century; and the Gernons held
Hergotestane, now called Haggerston. These two last
were long reckoned part of the parish of St. Leonard,
Shoreditch, which also includes, or included, a manor
named Norton Folgate, or perhaps, "Forth-the-Gate,"
which belonged to the dean and chapter of St. Paul's and
lay, as its name denotes, north of the city and outside
Bishopsgate.<note place="foot" n="35">The prebend of Holywell was in both St. Giles' Cripplegate, and St.
Leonard's Shoreditch. There is still a Holywell Street in Shoreditch.</note> It is mentioned, but not by name or as a

<date value="1537">1537</date>.</quote>  He it was who, as lord Percy, was contracted
to Anne Boleyn: and his name was freely used at the
unfortunate queen's trial, when this precontract was
among other things adduced against her. The engagement led to a very curious scene, detailed in Cavendish's
life of Wolsey, where the cardinal by the king's secret
order, endeavoured to detach Percy from the lady. His
course was to disparage her, to call her a foolish girl and
an unsuitable match for the heir of one of the greatest earldoms in the kingdom, and though Percy at first protested
that she was of <quote>right noble parentage, for her mother is
high of the Norfolk blood, and her father descended of
the earl of Ormond,</quote> he eventually yielded, and submitted himself to the will of the king and the cardinal.
It is to be observed that his subsequent marriage with
lady Mary Talbot, daughter of the earl of Shrewsbury, proved unhappy, and that he died childless little
more than a year after the queen's execution. His
monument which was formerly in <placeName key="Hackney">Hackney</placeName> church, has
long disappeared.<note place="foot" n="38">His only brother, Thomas Percy, had been beheaded a few months
before for participation in Aske's rebellion. The earldom became extinct,
but was revived twenty years later in favour of a son of Thomas.</note></p>
<p>  The manor reverted to the crown, the reversion having
already been secured by a deed. It obtained, short as
was the time it belonged to any sovereign, the name of
kingshold, in contradistinction to "lordshold," the estate
remaining to the bishop out of his original lordship.
Kingsland and Kingsland Road still indicate the site,
but there is little air of antiquity left in any part of
<placeName key="Hackney">Hackney</placeName>. Here and there a "Queen Anne" or early
Georgian house may be seen, with a heavy cornice and



   <pb n="161" id="p.161"/>

deep-set windows, and perhaps a wrought-iron garden
gate, but gardens are themselves becoming every day
more rare as the town creeps on. A little chapel once
stood by the turnpike at Kingsland. It was only twenty-seven feet long, but sufficed for the wants of a small
branch "Lazar House" attached to St. Bartholomew's.
The "loke" was removed in the last century, but the
chapel only disappeared in <date value="1846">1846</date>. It stood actually
within the boundary of Islington.<note place="foot" n="39">Wilkinson's ' Londina Illustrata,' i. 121.</note></p>
<p>  The bishop's land was termed <soCalled>lord's hold,</soCalled> as the
bishop was the original lord of the whole manor of
<placeName key="Stepney">Stepney</placeName>.  It went with Stepney to the Wentworths,
but after the Commonwealth was not restored to them,
and passed through the hands of various owners, chiefly
as I have said, Daniels and Tyssens, many of whom were
commemorated in <placeName key="Hackney">Hackney</placeName> church. Both came originally
from Holland and were great in the city. There are still
some fine old houses to be seen at Hackney, but most
of those we read of in the last century have disappeared. Among them was Balmes or Baumes, now only
commemorated by Balm Road. It was built about
<date value="1660">1660</date> and had a high picturesque roof.<note place="foot" n="40">Lysons, i. 320.</note> The estate on
which it stood was sold to Richard Beauvoir in <date value="1680">1680</date>,
and belongs or lately belonged to his descendants the
Benyon family.  Balmes became eventually a madhouse, but has long disappeared, though the streets and
squares of the neighbourhood preserve the names of
some of its successive owners. A family named Perwich
who kept a boarding school for young ladies at Hackney
after the Restoration obtained celebrity on account of the
beauty and accomplishments of Susanna Perwich, who
was buried in the middle aisle of the church in <date value="1661">1661</date>,





<pb n="162" id="p.162"/>

having died <quote>in the 25th year of her age, of a fever
which she caught by sleeping in a damp bed.</quote>  This
paragon of perfection might have proved a rival to the
lovely and clever Anne Killigrew, almost her contemporary, on whose death Dryden wrote an ode. But
Miss Perwich's poet did not attain the lofty pitch of
Dryden. His verses, indeed, have  about them an
echo of Hudibras which mars their elegiac character,<note place="foot" n="41">The book is somewhat scarce, and most modern writers have been
content to borrow the lines which Lysons copies.  The title runs as

<p>  Several pages are occupied with an account of her

<p>
WHEN we speak at the present day of  <soCalled>crown property,</soCalled>
the phrase bears a very different meaning from that
which it bore under the Tudors. The first effect of the
suppression of the monasteries was to throw an enormous amount of land into the possession of the crown.
If such an accession of wealth came, by any conceivable
accident or arrangement, into the hands of the crown
as things are now constituted, the result might be a
lightening of public burdens, a relief of pauperism, a
remission of taxation. We often hear an ignorant person
complain when some rich man has died without heirs
and intestate, that his money has <soCalled>gone to the crown</soCalled>
little thinking that  <soCalled>the crown,</soCalled> in this sense, means the
grumbler himself, and all the other taxpayers who are
benefited by an increase of the national income. But to
Henry VIII., and to Somerset and Northumberland, his
successors in power, a crown estate was as much the
property of the king as the chain round his neck or the
ring on his finger.  Under queen Mary the tendency
was not so much to treat the monastic estates as the
private property of the sovereign as to regard them in
the light of a trust to be returned to their ancient owners
at the first opportunity. Under Elizabeth, again, something more like the modern view prevailed.  When
crown lands were given away it was for a consideration.
Many of the existing private estates in the suburbs of







<pb n="166" id="p.166"/>

<placeName key="London">London</placeName> were purchased from the government of this
queen, and were paid for in sums commensurate at that
time with their real value. Under James the old system
revived, but even the thrifty Elizabeth had not left the
crown property as large as it was when Henry VIII.
died, and the grants made by the Stuarts were few, in
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>, at least.</p>
<p>  The enormous extent of the ecclesiastical estates in
the suburbs, and their seizure by the crown, have
proved circumstances of the happiest kind for us of the
time of queen Victoria. It is to them we owe the
parks. All these <soCalled>lungs of <placeName key="London">London</placeName></soCalled> were at one time
or another church or abbey land. In those parts of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> where the church lands remained to the church
no parks were made. St. Paul's, in name at least, still
holds St. Giles's and St. George's; Gray's Inn and Tottenham Court are prebendal manors, as are Camden
Town and Somers Town, and other over-populous
districts with changed names. They were not alienated
by king Henry, but by their ecclesiastical owners.<note place="foot" n="1">For a list of the prebendal manors, see Appendix E.</note></p>
<p>  Further west we have two manors in the parish of St.
Marylebone, one of which belonged to the nuns of
Barking, and the other to the knights of St. John. The
next parish, Paddington, belonged to Westminster Abbey,
and, having formed part of the endowment of the short-lived bishopric of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, became, and still, in
name, remains the property of the see of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.
Next we have Westbourne, still the property of Westminster Abbey. Further west again we come to <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, the estate of the abbot of Abingdon. Half
the great manor of <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> belonged to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
and is still the property of the dean and chapter.
Crossing the Thames we find a momentary break in this






                         <pb n="167" id="p.167"/>

almost continuous ring of ecclesiastical land.    Kennington was, and is, a crown manor, and annexed to the
duchy of Cornwall, but Lambeth was the archbishop's,
Walworth belonged to the cathedral church of Canterbury, and Bermondsey, on the south-east, to the abbey
of St. Saviour, there established. Crossing the Thames
again we find Stepney, the immense manor of the see of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>; and so have completed a circuit, at a fairly
uniform distance, of the ring of estates which at the
present day are the site of the principal suburbs.</p>
<p>  The gradual alienation of their estates by the canons
of St. Paul's forms the subject of a curious chapter in
ecclesiastical history.  The present nominal arrangement of the stalls seems to have come into force about
the middle of the twelfth century.  A meeting was held
at St. Paul's in <date value="1150">1150</date> as to <quote>bread and beer,</quote><note place="foot" n="2">'Newcourt, Repertorium,' i. 173. Oddly enough he spells cervisio
as servicio; but the meaning is plain.</note> and
apparently some manors which had been appropriated to
the food of the canons were now divided into residential
estates.  There is a certain monotony in the subsequent
history of these estates. They were leased away by the
incumbents, who gradually ceased to have any interest
in what is still nominally their property. </p>
<p>  The Middlesex manors belonging to the prebends of
St. Paul's are all to the north or north-west of the city.<note place="foot" n="3">They are Eald street, Holborn, Holywell, Cantlers, Mora, St. Pancras,
Portpool, Ruggemere, Tottenhall, Wenlakesbarn, Newington, Willesden,
Brondesbury, Brownswood, Chamberlainwood, Harlesden, Mapesbury,
Neasdon, Oxgate, and Twyford.</note> It may be worth while to trace the history of some of
them, though it is often hardly possible to identify them,
so changed are the modern names, so entirely are the
original lords forgotten. The prebendal manor of Holywell, for example, which comprised the great district





<pb n="168" id="p.168"/>

now covered by Finsbury, was, in <date value="1315">1315</date>, leased away by
its incumbent<note place="foot" n="4">Robert de Baldok. <quote>The lease, which has been renewed from
time to time, will expire in the year <date value="1867">1867</date>,</quote> says Mr. Aungier, 'French
Chron.' (Cam. Soc.), p. 53.</note>  to the mayor and commonalty of the
city for the annual rent of twenty shillings. The corporation have had to surrender it to the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, the lease having run out and died
a natural death in <date value="1867">1867</date>. I do not know that the
occupant of the stall now labelled " Finsbury" receives
as much as his pound a year. Ealdstreet yields no
income to its holder, though the manor, which evidently
from its name was on the Roman road, may be identified
with the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Old Street,
St. Luke's, is probably called after the prebend. The
Moor, at Moorgate, was a manor in the parish of St.
Giles Cripplegate, as was Wenlakesbarn, or Wenlocksbarn.  We must not suppose that these prebendal
manors, though I have called them, for convenience,
incumbencies, were in any sense parochial charges.
They were merely, when they emerge upon the page of
history, estates. It is possible that when they were first
founded some spiritual charge was annexed to them:
but in the twelfth century there is no trace of anything
but the ownership of the land.</p>
<p>  These prebendal manors originally no doubt came up
to the very walls of the city. But at a remote period,
when land was not very valuable, and life insecure without
special protection, a series of monasteries sprung up just
outside the walls. St. Bartholomew, for instance, was
built on waste ground, as we are told. But, waste or
cultivated, the ground was stolen from a prebend,
perhaps that of Holborn.<note place="foot" n="5">See account of the foundation, vol. i. chap. iv.</note>  There is a notice in the

Domesday Book, of a small holding near Newgate,
called  <soCalled>No man's land.</soCalled> This became part of the site
of the Charterhouse,<note place="foot" n="6">Vol. i. chap. viii. There is a full and careful account of the foundation
by Archdeacon Hale in the ' Transactions of the <placeName key="London">London</placeName> and Middlesex
Archaeological Society,' iii. 309.</note> and was anciently reckoned in the
parish of St. Sepulchre, which was partly within and
partly without the city boundary.  The two modern
parishes of St. Bartholomew, the Great, and the Less,
were taken out of St. Sepulchre at the dissolution. But
the site of the Charterhouse became, and continues,
extra-parochial. Sir Walter Manny and bishop Northburgh united to found the Carthusian monastery, and its
church was consecrated by bishop Stratford, Northburgh's successor. Several small holdings were united,
and the names are interesting though it would be difficult to identify them. Pardon Churchyard was a burying
ground belonging to the knights of Clerkenwell. Spittle
Croft was a field belonging to the <soCalled>spital</soCalled> of St. Bartholomew. There was also Newchurch Haw, and further
north lay Hervye's Croft. In <date value="1429">1429</date> William Rendre,
citizen and barber, let to the monks for eighty years, at
the rent of a red rose, an acre of land which contained a
spring, and a map showing the sources of the water
supply of the house is still extant.<note place="foot" n="7">In the Charterhouse. See Mr. Hale's paper, as above.</note> Rendre's acre is
very minutely described: it was pastureland, and lay in
a field called <soCalled>Conduit Shote,</soCalled> near <soCalled>Trillemylle Brook,</soCalled>
in the parish of <soCalled>St. Andrew de Holborne,</soCalled> and was
bounded on the north and west by the pasture of the
Carthusians, on the south by that of the prior and
convent of St. Bartholomew, and on the east by the king's
highway leading <quote>de Holborne versus Kentish town.</quote></p>
<p>  The Carthusians were, perhaps, more cruelly treated





<pb n="170" id="p.170"/>

by Henry VIII. than any other monks. The number
of their houses in England was only nine, but they
claimed the credit of having numbered St. Hugh,
bishop of Lincoln, among their ranks. They preserved
to the last their reputation for consistent and Christian

</note> They strongly opposed the new
doctrine of the king's supremacy, and even their submission in <date value="1535">1535</date> was only followed by the arraignment
of prior Houghton for having spoken too freely on the
subject. Two of his monks were brought up with him,
and a form of trial was gone through. Their old friend
More saw them going to execution from his prison in the
Tower, and remarked on their cheerful demeanour. The
utmost barbarity then prescribed by the law was inflicted
on them, and Houghton's mangled body was set up over
the gate of his monastery. Three more of the monks
were similarly treated after a month's respite.  Even
this second exhibition of severity left some of the brethren
unconvinced. Cromwell's visitor, Fylott, recommended
that it was <quote>very necessarie to minysh the numbre</quote> of
the monks, at least by so many as will not give up the
pope and accept the king's supremacy.<note place="foot" n="9">'Chronicles of the Charterhouse,' p. 26.</note>  In <date value="1537">1537</date> a new
prior was appointed to succeed Houghton, in reality that
he might surrender the house to the king, and the oaths
were offered to the remaining monks. Ten of their
number absolutely refused. Their brethren surrendered
and received pensions, but these ten were conveyed to
Newgate, chained in an unwholesome dungeon, and so
cruelly treated by Cromwell's agent, Thomas Bedyll,
that in a few days half of them died. A letter from

                        <pb n="171" id="p.171"/>

Bedyll to his master is extant.  It reveals a depth of
inhumanity unusual even under Henry VIII.   <quote>The
monks,</quote> he says, <quote>be almost despatched by the hand of
God,</quote> which in this case meant misery and starvation
purposely inflicted, and he adds a list of five who had
died, of two who were <quote>even at the point of death,</quote> of
two who were sick, and says, <quote>there be one hole.</quote> One
of the two sick men was eventually the sole survivor,
and after lying for four years in prison he was hanged.
A portion of Bedyll's letter is taken up with commendations of the prior who had surrendered the house; and
especially says of him <quote>He is a man of such charity as
I have not seen the like.</quote> Bedyll seems to have been
a judge of charity. The other monks went to Bruges,
and continued steadfast to their vows.  On  Mary's
accession they returned, and at her death departed again,
but Elizabeth evidently respected their consistent life,
for she gave them a safe conduct.</p>
<p>  The subsequent fate of the house was somewhat
different from that of most of the <placeName key="London">London</placeName> monasteries.
It became, indeed, for a time the palace of a series of
noblemen. The duke of Norfolk whom Mary Stuart
lured to his death made it his headquarters, and built
several commodious chambers, and a tennis court. The
solitary cells of the Carthusians were unfit for ordinary
life, but it is remarkable that so much old work remains.
The chapel is mainly as it was built, and the cloisters
may be easily recognised. The duke's eldest son, the
earl of Arundel, held " Howard House" till his attainder
in <date value="1590">1590</date>, and it was afterwards granted to his brother the
earl of Suffolk. In <date value="1611">1611</date> it was bought by Thomas
Sutton, and made the central feature of the noble foundation with which he endowed his fellow-citizens. For
reasons with which many people disagreed the Charterhouse






<pb n="172" id="p.172"/>

school has lately been removed to Godalming,
and one of Thomas Sutton's objects is thus defeated.
The advantages of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> for schools are obvious. To
mention one of them-there is no other place where boys
are so healthy, and there is no place where intellectual
life is so powerfully awakened.  Leech and Thackeray
were educated at the Charterhouse, and hundreds of
other men who have done credit to our country. The
company of merchant taylors, wiser than the governors
of the Charterhouse, when their old school in Suffolk
Lane, Dowgate,<note place="foot" n="10">See views of the old building in Mr. J. J. Stevenson's 'House Architecture,' i. 319.</note> was destroyed by the Metropolitan
Railway, took the discarded site of the Carthusians, and
moved their scholars to it. It is difficult to say whether
any of the old spirit was removed with the school to the
Surrey hills, but the Merchant Taylors' School has
naturally fallen heir to the greater part of it. The
traditions of Addison and Wesley were too fragile to
travel. Those of Thackeray are perhaps better preserved
by the hospital than by the school, which he nicknames
in some of his novels "the Slaughterhouse." There are
about fifty pensioners, called "Poor Brethren" in the
hospital, the maximum number allowed by the statutes
being eighty. Many of them are military men, and
Colonel Newcome has been identified with more than
one.</p>
<p>  The Hospitallers of <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName> always kept up
friendly relations with their more strictly monastic
neighbours in the Charterhouse.  There are many
records of negotiations respecting the water supply, a
question the importance of which in the middle ages
cannot be overrated. The two priories of <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName>
had been so long in possession that it is difficult now to




                          <pb n="173" id="p.173"/>

say to what parish the land originally belonged.  On the
whole it may be assumed as probably correct that the
whole modern parish of St. James, <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName>, was formerly in <placeName key="Islington">Islington</placeName>, as was part of the parish of St. John,
the rest having been taken from St. Sepulchre's.<note place="foot" n="11">Almost everything bearing on the question is printed by Mr. Tomlins
in his 'Perambulation of Islington.' His conclusions seem sometimes
incorrect, but as he gives all his proofs in full it is easy for the reader to
reason for himself. O that there were more like him !</note> For
Clerkenwell as it is now constituted owes its existence
entirely to the nunnery of St. Mary and the priory of
St. John. Indeed an outlying estate of the nunnery at
Muswell Hill used to be reckoned in the parish of St.
James; and likewise the possessions of the knights in
Hackney Marsh were claimed for St. John's.</p>
<p>  In the Domesday Book there is no mention of Clerkenwell; but the canons of St. Paul's, Geoffrey de Mandeville, Ralph the brother of Algar and Deorman, or
Derman, of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, hold all the lands in Islington.
Deorman's estate has been identified as Highbury.<note place="foot" n="12">See vol. i. page 86.</note>
Ralph held Tolentone, or Tollington.   The estate of
Mandeville came in two portions to the knights of St.
John, and may now be identified with <placeName key="Pentonville">Pentonville</placeName> and
with <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName> itself, except what was taken out of
St. Sepulchre's. The estate of Deorman came eventually
to the nunnery, and so the only lay family which continued for any time to hold land near <placeName key="London">London</placeName> was
extinguished.</p>
<p>  Both the nunnery and the house of the knights are
usually said to have been founded by Jordan Briset in
<date value="1100">1100</date>. With regard to the priory this may be true. With
regard to the house of the Hospitallers it is almost
certainly an error.  The order of St. John was only
instituted on the capture of Jerusalem in the previous


<pb n="174" id="p.174"/>

year. Jordan placed the nunnery on fourteen acres of
land close to what we know as Clerkenwell Green; and
the priory grew and prospered rapidly, obtaining gifts of
land both in the immediate neighbourhood and in other
parts of England. The prioresses had many transactions
as to their estates with their wealthy neighbours the
knights; and when the house was suppressed their
income was 262&#x00A3;. 19s.<note place="foot" n="13">Malcolm, iii. 202.</note>  Their church stood where St.
James's stands now, and was full of goodly monuments.
It was granted to various private persons who let it to
the people as a parish church, and at length in <date value="1656">1656</date> the
parishioners purchased it and elected a " curate " to carry
on the services. An act of parliament, passed in <date value="1788">1788</date>,
placed things on a more legal footing, and a new church,
which is very conspicuous, especially from the Fleet
valley and Farringdon Street, was built. The living is
now termed a vicarage, but the householders of the
parish elect the vicar, as of old.</p>
<p>  The site of the nunnery and the adjacent lands were
granted away by the crown very soon after the dissolution. They came at length to the Cavendish family, and
their representative, the duke of Newcastle, resided in
his house here in the reign of Charles II. Two or three
streets still commemorate the name. The Clerken Well
was long identified with a pump in Ray Street, formerly
Rag Street.<note place="foot" n="14">The pump is figured in Wilkinson, ii. 131.</note>  The fraternity of parish clerks are said to
have resorted annually to this well to perform a miracle
play, and the name of the place is commonly derived
from the circumstance. Clerkenwell Close still indicates
the place occupied by the domestic buildings of the
Benedictine priory.</p>
<p>  The modern church was consecrated in <date value="1792">1792</date>, and



                           <pb n="175" id="p.175"/>

stands as nearly as possible on the site of the nuns'
chapel. In the vaults are buried the ex-lord prior Weston,
who died of a broken heart, it was said, at the dissolution.
though the unusually large pension of <date value="1000">1000</date>&#x00A3;. a year had
been granted to him. The last prioress, Isabella Sackville, also lies here. In the churchyard, among other
eminent folk, rests Weever the antiquary. His grave
cannot now be identified. He died in <date value="1632">1632</date>. His epitaph
said of him-
<quote rend="blockquote">          "He laboured in a learned strain
          <lb/>To make men long since dead to live again."
</quote></p>
<p>  It does not appear that the lines he wrote for his own
epitaph were placed on his grave:-
              <quote rend="blockquote">" Lancashire gave me breath,
              <lb/>And Cambridge education,
              <lb/>Middlesex gave me death,
              <lb/>And this church my humation,
              <lb/>And Christ to me hath given
              <lb/>A place with Him in Heaven."
</quote>
The society of antiquaries sought in vain for Weever's
tomb when the church was rebuilt. It was near the
west end. The preface to his 'Funeral Monuments' is
dated from his house in Clerkenwell Close.</p>
<p>  Immediately south of the precincts of the Benedictine
nuns we enter by the narrow Jerusalem Passage into
the spacious St. John's Square, which was once the
courtyard of the house of the knights of the Hospital.
There is something unaccountable in the fact that the
date of the foundation of the house is unknown. It is
usually given as <date value="1100">1100</date>, and Jordan Briset is mentioned as
the founder. We may safely reject both assertions. The
confusion between the two priories of <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName> is illustrated
by the contradictions as to the burial of Jordan
and his wife Muriel.  Sometimes they are said to have




<pb n="176" id="p.176"/>

been buried in St. John's, sometimes in St. James's; sometimes they are separated, and one is assigned to the
church of the knights and the other to that of the nuns.<note place="foot" n="15">The register of St. John claimed them both (Malcome, iii. 201).
    Weever and Stow agree that they were buried in the chapterhouse of the
  nuns. Dugdale separates them. See Newcourt, i. 657.</note>
The only fact which can be relied on is that the church
of the knights of St. John was consecrated in <date value="1185">1185</date> by
Heraclius, patriarch of Jerusalem, who was in England
at the time preaching a crusade. He had consecrated
the church of St. Mary for the Templars in the previous
month, and appears to have been exceedingly active in
obtaining recruits, though the councillors of king Henry,
greatly to the indignation of the patriarch, would not
  allow him to leave England. Richard, his son, assumed
 the cross.  <quote>I maye not wende out of my lond,</quote> said the
  king to Heraclius, according to Fabian, <quote>for myn owne
  sonnes wyll aryse agayne me whan I were absent.</quote>
  <quote>No wonder,</quote> answered the patriarch, <quote>for of the devyll

  <quote>departed from the kynge in great ire.</quote></p>
<p>     In a very short time the priory of the knights of

of the house were reckoned to amount to <date value="2385">2385</date>&#x00A3;. 12s. 8d.
Queen Mary restored the knights to their ancient house,
and Sir Thomas Tresham became the last lord prior.
The house had been retained by the crown, and during
the reigns of Henry VIII. and his successors it was
sometimes used as a royal residence. But the church
was half ruined by the protector Somerset to obtain
materials for the great house he projected in the Strand:
and in the beginning of king James's reign it belonged
to lord Burghley, afterwards second earl of Exeter.
In <date value="1706">1706</date> it was bought by Simon Michell, who repaired it,
and, in <date value="1723">1723</date>, sold it to the Commissioners for Fifty New
Churches, who made it a parish church, and in December
of the same year it was formally consecrated, and is now
a rectory in private patronage.</p>
<p>  There are few relics of antiquity apparent in the
exterior of St. John's church. But the ancient crypt
remains and is a most interesting example of mixed
Norman and Early English architecture.   It was
formerly filled with coffins, but they have been removed
to the side aisles and bricked in, and the central vaulting is to be seen without interruption.</p>
<p>  Many eminent people have lived in St. John's
Square since the dissolution, but it is now the headquarters of the clock and watch manufacture, and also
largely occupied by printing houses.  Burnet resided
long in a house on the west side opposite the church.
<persName key="Wilkes, John">John Wilkes</persName> was born in the square, where his father
was a distiller: but his house was pulled down in <date value="1812">1812</date>.
The earls and marquises of Northampton have long
been reckoned lords of the manor, and the site of their
house, Northampton Square, lies to the north-east, near
Goswell Street.

<p>  The Gate is famous as the residence of Edward Cave,
who published here the first number of the 'Gentleman's
Magazine,' in <date value="1731">1731</date>. There is a handsome chamber
over the archway, and the whole of what remains of the
old building has of late years been rescued from destruction and the desecration of a tavern, and put in good
repair by a benevolent society of gentlemen, who call
themselves the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, and
claim to represent, it is difficult to understand on what
grounds, the English branch of the order.</p>
<p>  Near the southern end of St. John's Street, and close
to the great meat market lately made for the convenience of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> by the public spirit of the corporation, is the site of Hicks Hall, a sessions house built in

A sketch of its history will not be out of place here, the
more so as of late years it has become an integral part
of the great <soCalled>metropolitan area.</soCalled> <placeName key="Islington">Islington</placeName> is one of
the largest parishes in Middlesex, being, says Lysons,
three miles and one furlong in length, two miles and

both, as well as Upper and Lower Holloway, Canonbury, Highbury, Barnsbury, Stroud Green, and many
other <soCalled>hamlets.</soCalled> At the earliest period of which we
have any account a comparatively small portion remained
in the possession of the canons of St. Paul. Domesday
Book mentions three separate estates belonging to them
comprising in all eight hides, to only one of which is
any special name given.  This is Stanestaplc, which
may be identified with that part of the parish known as
Stapleton Hall, near Stroud Green. Another portion,
from having been let to the Berners or Barnes family,
became known as Barnsbury. Another part having it is
supposed been leased to the Mounteney family, came to
Jordan Briset with his wife, Muriel de Munteigni, or
Mounteney, and was given to the priory of St. Mary at
<placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName>. Some other smaller holdings came to the
knights of St. John, and in the end the church of
St. Paul had very little of Islington left. Even Canonbury, which might be supposed prebendal, if anything,
was the property of the prior of St. Bartholomew, having
been given by Ralph de Berners before the middle of
the thirteenth century. The prebendal manor, indeed,
dwindled to very small dimensions before <date value="1850">1850</date> when it was
ordered to be sold by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.
It was situated on the east side of Lower Street.

house was pulled down in <date value="1695">1695</date>. It had been inhabited
in the early part of the seventeenth century by Thomas
Sutton, the munificent founder of the Charterhouse
School and Hospital. The old church of St. Mary is a
quaint gothic structure,  <soCalled>restored</soCalled>  not very successfully
by the late Sir Charles Barry, in <date value="1829">1829</date>: but a new
church has been erected near it, from the designs of
Sir Gilbert Scott, the parishioners very wisely declining
to have the old church pulled down, as has been done

many curious monuments, including one to the memory
of <persName key="Dudley, John">John Dudley</persName>, whose widow married Thomas Sutton.
Dudley belonged to the same family as the great
duke of Northumberland, and a magnificent shield of
quarterings is on his tomb. In the churchyard is the
burial-place of Mrs. Barbauld and Dr. Aitkin and a
curious monument of the Pickett family, one of whom,
Elizabeth Pickett, in <date value="1781">1781</date>, was accidentally burnt to
death at the early age of twenty-three by her clothes
taking fire while she was ironing. Her epitaph contains
a sensible warning :-"Reader, if you should ever
witness such an afflicting scene, recollect that the only
method to extinguish the flame, is to stifle it by an
immediate covering."<note place="foot" n="22">Johnson's 'History of Stoke Newington,' p. 176.</note>   The parish remained rural
till very lately, but is now occupied by the better class
of villas, and presents a comparatively pleasant appearance from the number and size of well-planted open
spaces, among them  Abney Park Cemetery, which is
called after the late lessees. Isaac Watts came to Stoke
Newington as a guest of the Abneys and having lived
with them. for many years, died here and lies buried in

<p>  West of the city were the manors of Portpool, on the
north side of the Holborn road, and St. Andrew's on
the south. The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn are
owners if not lords of the manor of Portpool.   St.
Andrew's is cut up into small holdings, having in the
time of Richard II. been the property of John, lord
Strange of Knockyn,<note place="foot" n="23">' Lond. and Midd. Archaeo. Transactions,' i. 124. It is a pity that this

ruinous, and a new building was erected by Wren, who,

the baptisms is that of Benjamin Disraeli.</p>
<p>  The Holborn Viaduct has spoiled whatever there was

<p>  The local names which survive in Islington are very
interesting.  Highbury marks the site of the "castle"

was prebendary of <placeName key="Islington">Islington</placeName>.   Barnsbury similarly
shows us where the Berners family lived, a family
whose name still exists in the peerage. They held in
Islington the half of one knight's fee from the bishop

and literary lord Berners,<note place="foot" n="26">He is called on the titlepage of his ' Golden Boke,' John Bourchier,

to Sir Reginald Bray, in whose family it remained till
lord Sandys sold it in <date value="1539">1539</date> to Robert Fowler, whose
descendants in the female line possess it still. Canonbury, sometimes contracted into Canbury, is called after
the canons, not of St. Paul's, but of St. Bartholomew's.
It was surrendered to Henry VIII. in <date value="1539">1539</date>, and then
belonged successively to Cromwell, to Northumberland,

another curious letter extant in which lady Compton
describes the kind of state with which her household
was to be ordered, the number of gentlewomen, maidservants, laundresses, gentlemen, footmen, coaches and
horses, she thought necessary to support her dignity,
including 600&#x00A3;. a year for the performance of charitable
works.   The great lord Bacon rented Canonbury
House in <date value="1616">1616</date>, and after him the lord  keeper

Canonbury Tower, is still standing.</p>
<p>  Islington still contains some old houses and retains
the names of " the upper street," and " the lower street,"
now written with capital letters and without the article.
The church stands in Upper Street, and is dedicated,
almost as a matter of course, to St. Mary.  It was
rebuilt in the eighteenth century and cannot be called
beautiful, though its steeple is imitated from that of
Bow Church in Cheapside. The patronage was long in
the hands of the nuns of Bromley-by-Bow, and afterwards passed into the possession of a number of private
persons, but is now vested in trustees. There are a few
monuments of interest in the church including two brasses
of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>  Stoke Newington is another of the prebendal manors
north of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. The parish is comparatively small,
and very irregular in outline, some portions being completely detached.<note place="foot" n="29">A coloured map of Newington is in Johnson's' History and Antiquities
of the Parish,' published in <date value="1820">1820</date>.
</note> The prebendaries very early leased
it away, and a very small income seems now to be
attached to the stall in St. Paul's. In fact, a private

they will perhaps form with St. Andrew's a strange and
picturesque group. At present they are strange, indeed,
in their juxtaposition, but are not otherwise attractive.</p>
<p>  Besides the prebendal manor, there was also a smaller
estate, which requires something more than a passing
mention. Ely Place still exists on the north side of
<placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, and in it the chapel for which William of Louth,
bishop of Ely, in <date value="1298">1298</date>, made provision in his will.
This is all that remains of a residence given to the see
by John Kirkby,<note place="foot" n="30">Miss Phillimore says, in her life of ' Sir Christopher Wren,' that
 <quote>Ely House was an ancient possession of the see, the gift of William de
Ludd, who in the reign of Edward I. gave the house and endowed it with
his manor of Ouldbourne, a name which soon grew into Holbourn,</quote>" p. 118.
As the authority for this statement, ' Newcourt,' ii. 273, is cited; but this
page contains the conclusion of an account of Foulness in Essex. As, however, I have great faith in Newcourt, I looked in his account of St. Andrew's
Holborn, where I found some justification for Miss Phillimore's curious
statement :- <quote>Ely House, belonging to the Bishops of Ely, and given to
them by William de Luda, Bishop of that see, in the reign of Edward I.,
by the name of his Mannor of Ouldbourne, with the appurtenances.</quote> For
this information Newcourt refers to Stow. I have also great faith in Stow,
while I could hardly believe Newcourt to have misquoted him; but on
turning to his account of Holborn, or Oldborne, as he prefers to call it,
I find the innocent cause of all this tissue of errors :- <quote>William de Luda,
Bishop of Elye, deceased <date value="1297">1297</date>, gave this house by the name of his manor,
with the appurtenances, in Oldborne,</quote> &amp;c. &amp;c. The manor of William and
the appurtenances of the manor in Holborn is a somewhat different thing
from the house, <quote>endowed with his manor of Ouldbourne,</quote> of which
Miss Phillimore writes. I must apologise for making so large a note on
so small a matter, but this is a typical example of the way in which <placeName key="London">London</placeName>
history is too often compiled.

the Temple resented the intrusion of the bishop, who
had, however, some legal claim, and in the end recovered
damages for the refusal to admit him. Three centuries
later a similar intrusion drove the bishop into a corner
of his palace, and the case of Sir Christopher Hatton

and Bishop Cox is very like that of bishop Balsham and
the master of the Temple. Queen Elizabeth's famous
letter<note place="foot" n="31">The authenticity of this letter is doubtful.</note> to the <quote>proud prelate</quote> brought the bishop to
reason, but even the romantic rent of twenty bushels of
roses from " Hatton Garden " did not compensate him.</p>
<p>  Ely Place, although it was the  <soCalled>inn</soCalled>  or town-house of
the bishops, seems to have been always at the service of
any one who wanted a large and commodious hall for
entertainment or ceremony. Archbishop Arundel, while
he held the see of Ely, did much to improve it, and
Stow remembered to have seen his arms over a great
<quote>port, gate-house, or front, towards the street or highway.</quote><note place="foot" n="32">The gate and the garden are clearly seen in Newcourt and Faithorne's
'Delineation of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> and <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,' recently reprinted.</note>  This was the palace in which John of Gaunt
spent the later years of his life. It was nine years after
Arundel came to Ely that the rebels burnt the Savoy.
The duke of Lancaster took refuge with his kinsman the
bishop,<note place="foot" n="33">They descended in the same degree from Henry III., and John of
Gaunt's first duchess was Arundel's first cousin.</note> and probably the house was large enough for
both. Here, in the reign of Edward IV., the serjeants
at law held their feast, when a curious contest for precedence occurred. Among the invited was Sir Matthew
Philip, mayor of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, a member of the goldsmiths'
company, and distinguished by his military prowess, as
he had been knighted on the field of battle during the
wars of the Roses. Another of the guests was the lord
treasurer, lord Grey de Ruthyn, who insisted on taking
the first place, whereupon the mayor and aldermen left
the feast and went back into the city, <quote>and the new
serjeants and others were right sorry therefore.</quote><note place="foot" n="34">The story is told at some length by Stow, p. 144, together with details
of other feasts here.
</note> The







<pb n="186" id="p.186"/>

mayor consoled his aldermen by a feast at his own
house, <quote>howbeit he and all the citizens were wonderfully
displeased.</quote>  It may be a question whether the mayor
had a right to sit above the lord treasurer, and whether
Ely House lies within or without the city liberties.
Possibly, as Stow hints, he considered it within them,
but the police reckon it without at the present day.
The gardens of Ely House must have been remarkably
productive. In addition to bushels of roses we read of
strawberries, and a famous passage in Shakespeare's
Richard III.' is a quotation, more or less accurate, of an
anecdote in Hollingshead :-
        <quote rend="blockquote">My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn,
          <lb/>I saw good strawberries in your garden there.</quote>
</p>
<p>  As an episcopal residence, Ely Place must have been
rather an encumbrance to the see. To judge from the
magnificence of the chapel, together with what we read
of royal entertainments in the hall, of courts and cloisters
and colonnades, it must have been one of the most
magnificent private houses in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. Perhaps it was
to help in keeping it up that it was so often lent. We
can easily believe that some of the bishops gave up the
state apartments without leaving their own.  Henry
Ratcliffe, earl of Sussex, was staying here at the time of
Henry VIII.'s death. Here <persName key="Dudley, John">John Dudley</persName> was living in
<date value="1549">1549</date>, and here the combination was formed against
Somerset which led Dudley along the regular path of
ambitious statesmen under the Tudors-to the protectorship, a dukedom, and the scaffold upon Tower
Hill. At length this hospitality of the bishops was
carried too far. Sir Christopher Hatton<note place="foot" n="35">The story is in all the hooks, but best in Malcolm's 'Londinium
Redivivum.'
</note>  was not satisfied





                    <pb n="187" id="p.187"/>

to take the house for a term. Bishop Cox died in
<date value="1581">1581</date>, and the see was vacant for eighteen years, during
which Sir Christopher got a firm hold, and bishop
Heton in vain opposed the grant. There were too many
examples all around of similar grants. Where were the
manors of Portpoole, of Holborn itself, of Rugmere?
Were they still in ecclesiastical hands? Why should
this stately mansion be an exception? Besides, Sir
Christopher was prepared to improve the property. The
bishop was poor, and did not want so great a house; he
might retain his lodgings by the chapel. The roofs
were very extensive, the gardens were enormous, there
was a constant outlay needed, and Sir Christopher was
willing to spend his money freely. He soon ran up a debt
to the queen which he could not pay. Queen Elizabeth's
heartless demand for the money, her subsequent repentance, her strange visit to Ely Place, when Hatton lay
sick and sorrowful, and, as it turned out, actually dying,
are all duly recorded, with circumstantial minuteness, in
many books: but we find Sir Christopher's nephew and
heir here in the following reign ; and are told of the performance of a mystery play, the last in England, in the
hall before Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, the same
ambassador who pursued Raleigh to his death.</p>
<p>  It was Gondomar who, with his bait of a Spanish
marriage, sent prince Charles on his celebrated expedition. The party was carefully organised; the prince
was to be royally attended. His spiritual as well as his
bodily wants were to be provided for, and Dr. Maw,
afterwards bishop of Bath, and Dr. Matthew Wren were
designated to accompany him and guard him from the
assaults of Popery.  But Charles and Buckingham
started by themselves, and the whole nation was  <quote>persuaded that the prince's faith would be tampered with,</quote>






<pb n="188" id="p.188"/>

and his person endangered. The chaplains were speedily
despatched, but had James's subjects seen the instructions with which he furnished them they would not have
been so well satisfied of his safety from the ghostly
enemy. The chaplains were provided with vestments,
with ornaments and hangings for the altar, with altar
lights and Latin prayer books, and were directed to hold
frequent services and to order their behaviour <quote>so near
the Roman form as can lawfully be done</quote>; and the
king added, <quote>It hath ever been my way to go with the
Church of Rome usque ad aras.</quote> With a characteristic
quotation James dismissed them, and they reached
Madrid in safety, but the apartments assigned to the
prince in the palace were not furnished with a chapel,
and so there was <quote>no public service, only bed-chamber
prayers.</quote><note place="foot" n="36">Miss Phillimore's ' Wren,' p. 8.</note> </p>
<p>  After Wren's return he received some preferment at
once: but, though he continued in favour with the
prince, he did not rise very high till the new reign commenced. Charles took him with him to Scotland when
he went to be crowned at Scone, and soon afterwards
made him dean of Windsor and registrar of the Garter.
When <persName key="Wren, Matthew">Matthew Wren</persName> went up higher his brother, Christopher, the father of the architect, succeeded him at
Windsor; a happy event, as it turned out, since in the
troublous times of the great civil war the new registrar
buried the records of the illustrious order, and so preserved them for posterity when the jewels were lost. In
<date value="1634">1634</date> <persName key="Wren, Matthew">Matthew Wren</persName> became bishop of Hereford, and
was soon after translated or promoted to Norwich and
Ely successively. Bishop Heton had been succeeded by
Lancelot Andrewes, Wren's old tutor, and he by three
other bishops, none of whom had managed to oust the







                       <pb n="189" id="p.189"/>

Hattons from Ely Place. Bishop White was deep in
the lawsuit when he died. The same difficulty had
delayed the proceedings in every case. The bishops were
poor men. The Hattons had laid out money on the
house. How were they to be repaid ? The new bishop
was not a man to be deterred from what he considered
his public duty by any hesitation as to his private purse.
He brought his action into the Court of Requests, and
produced the money. Lady Elizabeth Hatton, seeing
now which way the decision must go, commenced to
pull down the lead-work and to cut down the trees.
Wren obtained an injunction against her. But the blood
of the Nevils and Cecils was up. She had defied her
husband and turned him out of doors, though he was a
chief justice. A mere bishop was nothing to her. She
disobeyed the injunction. But bishop Wren was not
a man to be trifled with. Lady Elizabeth very speedily
found herself actually arrested and committed to the
Fleet. We should like to have particulars, but none
have come down to us. Was she really incarcerated, or
did a payment of fees and the observance of certain
formalities suffice? We may be sure that whatever was
the strictest course of the law was followed; and the
reader might expect to hear immediately of the restoration of their old manor-house to the bishops, and the
triumph of right over usurpation. But it was otherwise
ordained. The bishop had offended the Parliament by
proceedings of much greater public importance than the
ejectment of lady <persName key="Hatton, Elizabeth">Elizabeth Hatton</persName><note place="foot" n="37">She seems never to have assumed her second husband's name. He
was not a knight when she married him. Most writers who mention her
call her simply lady Hatton.</note>  from Ely House.
In July, <date value="1641">1641</date>, he was accused of setting up altar-rails,
ordering the reading of the Book of Sports, turning out




<pb n="190" id="p.190"/>

nonconformist ministers, preaching in a surplice, and
other "innovations," and very soon not lady Elizabeth but her opponent went to prison. Bishop Wren
was sent to the Tower, and with a brief interval, in
<date value="1642">1642</date>, he continued there till Ely Place had been almost
destroyed, till lady <persName key="Hatton, Elizabeth">Elizabeth Hatton</persName> was long dead,
till Charles and Laud had been beheaded; in short, till
all he most venerated and best loved had disappeared,
including his own wife and the Church itself for which
he suffered.</p>
<p>  In spite of his retrograde views on some subjects, Wren
remains one of the most interesting figures in the long
tragedy of the Great Rebellion. When release came
at last, and the son of the king he had loved perhaps
too well was restored to the throne, he quietly began
again his episcopal work where he had left off twenty
years before; and one of his first acts was to <quote>exhibit
his bill in Chancery (as he had done before the war in
the Court of Requests) against the Lord Hatton and
others for the redemption</quote>  of Ely House. Everything
had changed except the stout-hearted bishop. It was
hard for bishop Heton to contend against the chancellor, or for bishop White to contend against Sir
<persName key="Coke, Edward">Edward Coke</persName>, who had married lady Elizabeth,<note place="foot" n="38">She was the daughter of the earl of Exeter. Her pride, quarrelsome
temper, and marriages, are the subject of many pleasant passages in the
memoirs of the time: most of them may be found summarised in Thornbury's 'Old and New <placeName key="London">London</placeName>,' vol. ii.
</note> and
become chief justice in <date value="1613">1613</date>. But the chief justice was
dead: lady Elizabeth, who, in <date value="1638">1638</date>, had gone to prison
rather than yield to his order of the court, and who
enjoyed a brief triumph in the early days of the Rebellion,
followed her husbands in <date value="1646">1646</date>.</p>
<p>  During the Commonwealth the house was made first




                       <pb n="191" id="p.191"/>

into a prison and then into a hospital for wounded
soldiers and their families. It was connected a second
time with the Savoy, when, in <date value="1660">1660</date>, just before the
restoration, a sum of money was voted to both. But
lord Hatton was at least nominally still in possession,
and, when the bishop's bill came before the Court of
Chancery, he was actually engaged in converting the
noble garden into streets. Lady Elizabeth, before the
Commonwealth and the imprisonment of bishop Wren,
had commenced to dilapidate the house, and had cut
down the fruit trees. The whole district, now densely
populated, was first built over at this time; for Chancery
proceedings were proverbially slow, and the bishop
found little except the chapel and his own apartments
intact. Even the gate-house was pulled down-though
the gate still remains, or its successor-and, no doubt,
those parts of the domestic buildings which had been
occupied by the Hattons shared its fate, including the
splendid hall, where John of Gaunt had feasted, where
queen Elizabeth had danced, and where Gondomar had
intrigued.</p>
<p>  Wren's temper may be judged by an anecdote recorded
in Miss Phillimore's life of his more famous nephew.
During the Commonwealth, and while <persName key="Wren, Matthew">Matthew Wren</persName>,
the bishop, was in the Tower, expecting the fate of Laud,
young <persName key="Wren, Christopher">Christopher Wren</persName>, the philosopher, became acquainted with <persName key="Claypole, Richard">Richard Claypole</persName>. He was the husband
of <persName key="Cromwell, Elizabeth">Elizabeth Cromwell</persName>, the Protector's favourite daughter.
Wren frequently dined with the Claypoles, and on one
occasion met Oliver himself at their table.  <quote>Your
uncle,</quote> said Cromwell to the young man, <quote>has been
long confined in the Tower.</quote> <quote>He has so, sir,</quote> said
Wren, <quote>but he bears his affliction with great patience
and resignation.</quote> <quote>He may come out an' he will,</quote> said






<pb n="192" id="p.192"/>

the Protector. <quote>Will your Highness permit me to take
him this from your own mouth?</quote> asked the nephew.
Cromwell assented briefly, and Christopher hastened
with the good news to the Tower. But the bishop
would make no terms with  <quote>that miscreant.</quote> He refused
to submit in any way to the <quote>detestable tyranny</quote> of
the Protector, and remained in his prison till the arrival
of Monk. Two days after the Parliament had voted
<date value="1700">1700</date>&#x00A3; for the maimed soldiers in Ely House and the
Savoy, and for providing them with <quote>a preaching
minister,</quote> the gates of the Tower were opened, and
<quote> Dr. Wren, Bishop of Ely, was discharged from his
imprisonment,</quote> which had lasted more than eighteen
years.  In the following February Evelyn went to
service in the old chapel and records that <quote>after the
sermon the Bishop of Ely gave us the blessing very
pontifically.</quote></p>
<p>  Ely House and the Savoy were once more associated
in the conferences which led to the revision of the Book
of Common Prayer, and in which bishop Wren took a
prominent part. The general drift of his suggestions
may easily be surmised, and many of them were adopted.
The bishop survived to see the new book in general use.
A tradition at the Savoy, of which Sheldon was then
master, asserts that the revised Common Prayer was
first read there; but St. Etheldreda's was not far behind,
we may be sure. Bishop Wren constantly resided in the
house, and there are numerous references to the chapel
in contemporary memoirs. Three episcopal consecrations took place in it during bishop Wren's lifetime, one
immediately after his death,<note place="foot" n="39">Stubbs, 'Episcopal Succession.' The dates are <date value="1661">1661</date>, <date value="1662">1662</date>, <date value="1662">1662</date>,

here to a Mr. Draper somewhat more quaintly than is
the wont in his diary; for he says he gave her a portion
of &#x00A3;4000, and <quote>prays God Almighty to give her his
blessing.</quote>" The one is evidently considered the complement of the other.</p>
<p>  But before <persName key="Evelyn, Susanna">Susanna Evelyn</persName>, with 4000&#x00A3; and a blessing, became Mrs. Draper, a new bishop was in <persName key="Wren, Matthew">Matthew
Wren</persName>'s room. When he emerged from the Tower his
first care had been to build a chapel at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he had been a scholar under
Lancelot Andrewes. In choosing the architect to carry
out his work, bishop Wren's nepotism has conferred a
benefit on posterity. <persName key="Wren, Christopher">Christopher Wren</persName>'s first architectural work should have been respected even in this
"restoring " age. But the lengthening of the chapel of
Pembroke, so as to destroy Wren's proportions, and the
stripping of the walls, are, after all, but small things in
comparison with what the most ancient, but now, also,
alas! the newest of Cambridge colleges, has undergone
amid the boasted light and taste of our own day. The
bishop of Ely appropriately consecrated his chapel in
<date value="1665">1665</date>, on St. Matthew's Day. He was then seventy-nine,
but had still two years' work left in him. He survived the
plague, and witnessed the fire which was to afford his
nephew such fame, and dying at last in his house in
Holborn, in April, <date value="1667">1667</date>, his body was conveyed to Cambridge, and was buried in his new chapel there with
great pomp. He had never been able to shake off the
Hattons.  They covered the garden with wretched
buildings under his very eyes. The law moved very
slowly in those days, the bishop had many things of
greater importance on his hands, and the contest was
one in which time and close attention were most required. The death of bishop Wren may be said to have






<pb n="194" id="p.194"/>

settled the question, for though his successors protested
they did little else.</p>
<p>  At length, in <date value="1772">1772</date>, an act was obtained, enabling the
see to dispose of its claims and possessions. The remains
of the house and the reserved grounds were conveyed to
the crown for &#x00A3;6500 and an annuity of &#x00A3;200 to the
Bishop of Ely; and Clarendon House, in Dover Street,
Piccadilly, was bought for the see. It may easily be
distinguished by its stone front and the mitre carved
above the door, and is now one of the few official
episcopal residences left in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</p>
<p>  A <quote>very eminent architect and builder,</quote> whose name
was Cole, bought the site, and pulled away everything
except the chapel. Ely Place, sacred now to lawyers
and diamond merchants, was built, and the chapel was
let, according to the custom of the day. At the beginning of the present century it was held on lease by a
lady, the widow of a clergyman called Faulkner. She
provided a weekly preacher, and made what she could
out of the chapel. There is an amusing reference in
Cowper's 'Task'<note place="foot" n="40">Quoted in a volume by an anonymous author, 'A Notice of Ely
Chapel, Holborn,' published by Parker in <date value="1840">1840</date>, in which a good deal of
original information may be found.
</note> to the way in which the services were
carried on. It is evident that the clerk, probably the
only permanent official, had an inordinate influence.</p>
<p>  In <date value="1781">1781</date> the question arose, to which I have already
referred, as to whether Ely Place was in St. Andrew's or
not. In a trial before lord Mansfield about poor rates,
the judge thus stated it to the jury:-- <quote>The question
for you to try is simply, whether the palace of the Bishop
of Ely, in Holborn, sold to the public and by them to
the plaintiff (Mr. Cole), lies within the parish of St.
Andrew, Holborn, or is extra-parochial.</quote>  The jury





                            <pb n="195" id="p.195"/>

found for Mr. Cole, and, though poor rates were soon
after enforced, the latest maps leave Ely Place and
Hatton Garden outside the city boundaries.<note place="foot" n="41">See Collingridge's ' City of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> Directory,' <date value="1882">1882</date>.</note></p>
<p>  In <date value="1814">1814</date> the tenancy of Mrs. Britannia Faulkner
expired, and a new lease of the chapel was granted to a
Mr.Wilcox, but, in 8 5, the representatives of the National
Society for the Education of the Poor, then in its infancy,
made it their headquarters, and Mr. Coleridge, afterwards
bishop of Barbadoes, became chaplain. When the
society removed to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> the chapel was closed,
after a brief struggle for existence. In <date value="1843">1843</date> it was
assigned to a Welsh congregation, which dwindled and
flickered for thirty years before it was finally extinguished.  In <date value="1874">1874</date> a committee of eminent Roman
Catholics set churchmen an example and put them to
the blush by buying it and by laying out a considerable
sum in what cannot be considered an injudicious attempt
at restoration. Many features of interest were of course
lost, but, except for a certain tawdriness which seems
inseparable from a Romanist chapel, the general effect
is good, and by no means devoid of the appearance of
age. The ten side windows are very large and handsome, but the stained glass with which some of them
and the large east window are filled leaves much to
be desired, and some modern statues on the ancient
brackets look strangely out of place.<note place="foot" n="42">The chapel is 91 feet long and 39 feet wide.</note>  The crypt, long
desecrated as a wine vault, has been cleared and converted into a chapel, or series of chapels and confessionals. The curious row of pillars-all rebuilt-down

support are well worth seeing.</p>

character. Saffron Hill is one of the streets on the site
of the garden, which, as it lay behind the house, cannot
have been wholly in the place occupied by the present
street called Hatton Garden. To judge by Faithorne's
view or map, Kirby Street<note place="foot" n="43">Was Kirby Street called after Bishop Kirkby ?</note> would appear to be, so to
speak, the middle walk of the garden. Field Lane outside led down to the Fleet.</p>
<p>It is a question whether the little manor of the bishops
of Ely lay within the manor of Holborn or that of
Portpool. Both were within the original parish of St.
Andrew, and it seems likely that the highway, as in other
cases, formed the later boundary. The manor of Portpool
very early lost its prebendal character. In <date value="1241">1241</date> there
was a controversy between the monastery of St. Bartholomew's, Smithfield, and Roger Orset, who had the stall
of Portpool, and was precentor of St. Paul's.  They
claimed a piece of land which he alleged, and proved, to
be in his manor. It is called in the record by the puzzling
name of Alfrichebun, which may be in modern language
All-freshburn, and refer to one of the numerous little
streams which ran into the Fleet. Sixty-three years later
Portpool is spoken of as the property of the Greys, one of
whom, Reginald, let it or part of it for a " hospitium " or
inn, early in the reign of Edward III. Gray's Inn has
ever since been on the same site.  This Grey or Gray
family seems to have been that of Wilton. In the reign
of Henry VII. they conveyed the manor of Portpool to
the fellows and students of the honourable society.</p>
<p>  At the western extremity of the old parish is the
modern district of St. George the Martyr, Queen Square.<note place="foot" n="44">A history of this little parish has recently been compiled by Mr. J.
  Lewis Miller.

 It is sometimes, but very erroneously, described as in
 Bloomsbury; and reckoned a chapel of ease to St.
 George's in Hart Street. But it is a rectory taken out
 of St. Andrew's, Holborn, and is in a different manor
 and parish altogether.  It contains some interesting
 relics of old architecture, dear especially to the lovers of
 the so-called <soCalled>Queen Anne</soCalled> style. In <date value="1742">1742</date> the writer
 of a 'Survey of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>' observes that <quote>this parish
 being of a modern erection, it has few or no antiquities
 therein.</quote> A hundred and fifty years have transformed it
 into one of the older relics of western <placeName key="London">London</placeName>; and the
 antiquary may often be met prowling about the street
 corners and peering into the archways to find wrought-
 iron railings, bold brick cornices, shell-shaped doorways,
 pedimented windows, and all the other signs of the kind
 of building in fashion while Wren was yet alive. Queen
 Square was left open on the north side, it is said, in
 order that the inhabitants might enjoy the view of the
 Hampstead heights, and the open country between.
 Red Lion Square, which is also in this parish, is called
 from its having been the paddock of an inn, the Red
 Lion, still commemorated in a neighbouring signboard.
 At the Blue Boar, where now the Inns of Court Hotel
 has risen on the south side of the street, which is nearly
 opposite, <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Oliver Cromwell</persName> is said to have discovered,
 sewed up in a saddle, the documents compromising
 Charles I., which were used to bring him to the scaffold;
 and at the Red Lion the body of the same Oliver was
 deposited in its cerecloth the night before it was dragged
 to Tyburn to undergo the pitiful spite of the triumphant
 Royalists. The story has been frequently repeated that
the body never got further from Holborn than the Red
Lion Paddock, and a large and handsome obelisk in the
centre of the square <quote>was pretended to have covered the







<pb n="198" id="p.198"/>

bones of <persName key="Cromwell, Oliver">Oliver Cromwell</persName>, whereas the whole embellishment was promoted by a subscription of the inhabitants,
at the suggestion of Mr. Dillingham, a neighbouring
apothecary,</quote> says Malcolm.<note place="foot" n="45">Vol. ii. 306.</note>  But Mr. Dillingham's
suggestion does not in itself refute the tradition which
certainly obtained at one time considerable credit.</p>
<p>  Among the newer buildings in the district should be
mentioned the very handsome church in Red Lion
Square, built through the exertions of a private clergyman, Mr. Webber; and the very conspicuous but
hideous Hospital for Children, near Great Ormond
Street: an institution whose excellence as a charity is
no excuse for the remarkable and disfiguring ugliness
which makes its presence a misfortune to the neighbourhood. With the admirable examples of a simple and
picturesque style with which the whole parish of St.
George abounds before his eyes, the architect of the
hospital has achieved a feat very similar to that which
has placed St. Thomas's Hospital opposite the Houses
of Parliament and beside Lambeth Palace.</p>
<p>   Great Ormond Street is dated by its name.  In the
reign of George II. it was pronounced <quote>one of the finest
situations about town,</quote> on account of its north side
looking upon the open fields. Lamb, the charitable
individual, who, in <date value="1577">1577</date>, conducted water in a leaden
pipe from these fields to Snow Hill, has left his name in
Lamb's Conduit Street. Theobald's Road and Kingsgate Street recall the frequent journeys of James I.
to his hunting seat in Hertfordshire and the race
course at Newmarket. Powis Place in Great Ormond
Street is on the site of a house built by William Herbert,
marquis of Powis, the head of an eminent Jacobite family.
It was the centre of intrigues for the restoration of the



                         <pb n="199" id="p.199"/>

Stuarts during the reigns of William  and Anne.  In
<date value="1714">1714</date> it was burnt while in the occupation of the French
ambassador. In the popular belief he was engaged in
making the arrangements to be carried out on the demise
of the queen, which, in fact, occurred that same year. The
historian may reckon the fire at Powis House among the
political causes of the time. Louis XIV. magnificently
rebuilt the house, as his dignity <quote>would not suffer a fire
office to pay for the neglect of the domestic of his representative.</quote> There is not much of this kind of dignity
left in the world now.  Powis House was pulled down a
hundred years ago.<note place="foot" n="46">See Miller's ' Church and Parish of St. George the Martyr, Holborn.'
for further particulars. A view of the house is in 'Vitruvius Britannicus.'
</note>   The site is a perfect nest of
hospitals-the Homoeopathic standing also where, in
No. 50, Great Ormond Street, the Macaulay family long
resided, of which there is a touching reminiscence
recorded in the great historian's diary. In August <date value="1857">1857</date>,
he writes: <quote>I sent the carriage home and walked to the
Museum: passing through Great Ormond Street, I saw
a bill upon No. 50; I knocked, was let in, and went over
the house with a strange mixture of feelings. It is more
than twenty-six years since I was in it. The dining-room, and the adjoining room in which I once slept, are
scarcely changed; the same colouring on the wall, but
more dingy. My father's study much the same; the
drawing-rooms, too, except the papering; my bedroom
just what it was. My mother's bedroom-I had never
been in it since her death. I went away sad.</quote>

<p>THE modern west end of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> may be said to
commence with Rugmere: yet few, probably, of the
sixty thousand inhabitants of that great prebendal
manor have the slightest idea where it lies, or that they
are in it. We have all sorts of pretty stories about the
name of Bloomsbury. The wildest guesses are made as
to its origin and meaning. Some say it was Lomesbury
at first; others would connect it with some tradition of
gardens and flowers. That St. Giles's belonged to it;
that it was all comprised in an estate attached to a stall
in the cathedral of St. Paul's; that its name of Rugmere
probably referred to a pond, or pool, or marsh, on the
summit of the hill<note place="foot" n="\i">Already described in chap. i.</note> or ridge which separated the valley
of the Fleet from that of the Tyburn; that the name
Bloomsbury is evidently of personal origin, and must
refer to an owner or occupier-all these are facts, plain
enough, indeed, but never referred to in the pleasant
collections of anecdotes which sometimes do duty for
histories of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</p>
<p>  Rugmere, in Domesday, is described as a manor in
Ossulston, belonging to Ralph, a canon of St. Paul's.
It was assessed for two hides. It was worth thirty-five
shillings (a year), and had been worth forty in the time
of king Edward the Confessor. It was then, and had
been, in the demesne of the canons of St. Paul's. There is






                       <pb n="201" id="p.201"/>

not a word as to any sub-manor, nor mention of a division
between Bloomsbury and St. Giles's. When, a few years
ago, an eminent clergyman was appointed to the prebendal stall of Rugmere, a question as to where Rugmere might be went unanswered round the papers.
There was a Ralph, called Fitz Algod, canon of
Rugmere in <date value="1132">1132</date>, probably not the same as the
Ralph of Domesday.   Fitz Algod was succeeded by
his son William,<note place="foot" n="\i">Newcourt, i. 206.</note> and he by another Ralph, of Chilton,
archdeacon of Middlesex, who was alive in I 92.
Another canon of Rugmere, John de Crachale, a chaplain
to the good Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln,
was one of those privileged to hear the outburst of
heavenly music, near Buckden, on the night of the
bishop's death.<note place="foot" n="\i">' Roberti Grossteste Epistolse,' edited by Mr. Luard for the Rolls Series,
p. lxxxiii.</note></p>
<p>  If we look at any old map of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>-any map, that
is, made before the beginning of the present century-
we may observe that the old road, diverted, as I have
elsewhere shown, from the line of the Watling Street at
the Marble Arch, runs in an eastward direction towards
Newgate. It was a Roman road, and was, as usual with
the Romans, made as nearly straight as possible. That
is, from the Marble Arch, whence, as I have endeavoured
to show, it used to run straight to the Thames at
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, it now runs straight to the Thames at
London Bridge. But on examining the course of the
road with care, we see that at a certain point it made a
slight circuit to the south. We have long been accustomed
to the straight, or nearly straight line of Oxford Street,
and forget that it was only in the present reign that " New
Oxford Street"-the piece connecting the old street,



<pb n="202" id="p.202"/>

which ran to the Tottenham Court Road, with Holborn-
was made; and that, previously, on reaching a place
where there was a pond and a pound, and at one time
a gibbet, it would have turned a little to the right into
High Street, St. Giles's; and at High Holborn, after
describing a semicircle, have returned into the straight
Roman line of road again.</p>
<p>  The reason for this deflection is not known; but it is
not speculating too deeply to suggest that here, where
St. Giles's Pond remained almost till our own day, was
the Rugmere which gave its name to the prebendal
manor, and that the road made a circuit to avoid it. We
know for certain that there was a  <soCalled>mere</soCalled> at this place,
or very near it. We know that it was on the ridge, and
we know that the ridge is highest just here. It is but
reasonable to seek for some cause to account for the
bend in the usually inflexible course of a Roman road;
and no reason seems so good as this.</p>
<p>  But we may go further, and ask, What has become of
the mere? The first fact we have in the history of
Bloomsbury answers the question. Bloom, whose Bury
may be said still to exist, was one William Blemund, or
de Bleomund, or Blemot-the name occurs in all these
forms-who made a great fosse, called Blemund's Dyke,
or ditch, which drained the mere. This long-forgotten
worthy lived in the reign of king John, and his name
occurs in the deeds and charters connected with the
hospital of St. Giles, to which I shall have occasion to
refer a little further on. Blemund's Dyke divided the
northern half of Rugmere from the southern; but
Bloomsbury and St. Giles's are both parts of the original
manor of the prebendary of St. Paul's.</p>
<p>This great estate was bounded on the south by the
manor of the Savoy, on the west by St. Marylebone, on




                             <pb n="203" id="p.203"/>

the north by Tottenhall, on the east by Portpoole and
St. Andrew's, Holborn. When the hospital at St. Giles's
corner was founded in <date value="1117">1117</date>, a "Manor of St. Giles"
was apparently separated for its benefit.  Before the
passing of the Act " Quia emptores " such a separation
was easy. In a hundred years the rest of the original
manor, that part namely, which lay to the north of the
high road, now Oxford Street, was apparently alienated
like the southern part.  Blemund's ditch, referred to
above, passed behind the northern row of houses in
Holborn, but is now forgotten. The name survives in
"Bloomsbury."   The manor house of Rugmere was
isolated in the parish of St. Pancras.<note place="foot" n="\i">It is probably on this account that most writers make Rugmere a
manor in St. Pancras, like Tottenhall.</note></p>
<p>  The sub-manor of Bloomsbury passed through the
hands of many owners before it came in <date value="1617">1617</date> to <persName key="Wriothesley, Henry">Henry
Wriothesley</persName>, earl of Southampton, for the price of 6oo&#x00A3;.
In <date value="1668">1668</date>, the treasurer, Thomas, fourth earl, died, leaving
Bloomsbury to his co-heiress, the justly famous lady
Rachel, widow of lord Vaughan son of the earl of
Carbery, who, by her marriage with William, lord
Russell, conveyed to the Bedford family an estate of
which the value at the present day can only be reckoned
in millions.</p>
<p>  The original church was apparently at the place occupied in the twelfth century by the hospital of St. Giles,
the same site on which the modern church stands. It
was rebuilt in <date value="1734">1734</date>. Other parochial institutions were
to be found near the same place. At the corner of
the Tyburn Road, now Oxford Street, was the pound.
Near the pound was the <soCalled>cage,</soCalled><note place="foot" n="\i">At this corner a tavern bore the sign of the " Hog in Pound," till
  <date value="1881">1881</date>. A bank has been built upon the site.</note> apparently a lock-up

2s. For a shroud for a poor woman that died in the Cage 2s. 6d.</quote> Dobie,
p. 126.</note>  In <date value="1413">1413</date> between the wall of
the hospital and the pound, a gibbet was erected for
the execution of criminals.  It had previously stood
in Smithfield, though a double execution took place
far westward, at the afterwards famous Tyburn, more
than five-and-twenty years earlier.<note place="foot" n="\i">See vol. i., chap. vii.</note>  The modern church
was built in <date value="1734">1734</date>, but stands on the site of the hospital
chapel, which probably included an aisle for parochial
worshippers, as in other cases. It was succeeded by
a second church built in <date value="1623">1623</date>: in fact there can have
been but a scanty congregation at first, and the church
had to be enlarged to suit the gradual growth of the
population.</p>
<p>  The manor was granted, together with the buildings of
the Hospital of St. Giles or Lazar House, by Henry VIII.,
in <date value="1545">1545</date>, to <persName key="Dudley, John">John Dudley</persName>, who was then known as lord
Lisle, and afterwards as duke of Northumberland, and
Protector of the Realm in the minority of Edward VI.
Dudley fitted up the old buildings for his own residence,
but shortly after conveyed the whole of the premises to
Sir Wymond Carew, who, however, seems to have been
merely a trustee, and reconveyed or let it to the Dudley
family. The duchess of Dudley, the widow of an illegitimate son of queen Elizabeth's earl of Leicester, resided in
it till her death, at the age of ninety, in <date value="1669">1669</date>. She was a
great benefactor to the parish, and her monument is still
to be seen in the church. Meanwhile, the whole manor
was divided amongst various owners. Drury Lane commemorates the Drury family, whose town house was at






                             <pb n="205" id="p.205"/>

the Strand end of that thoroughfare. Great Wild Street
bears a name corrupted from that of the family of
Weld of Lulworth, who had long a residence here, in
what was called the Aldwych, or Oldwick, an open
space. Part of the name still survives in Wych Street.
The south-eastern corner of the parish abutted on
Temple Bar, and comprised what was known as Ficket's
Field, the jousting ground of the Templars. It is
now the so-called "Carey Street site " of the New Law
Courts.</p>
<p>  Lincoln's Inn Fields were also in the manor, and
chiefly claim notice here because the "square," though
an oblong, is said to equal the area covered by the
Great Pyramid of Geezeh. It was laid out, and one
side, the western, built by Inigo Jones, parts of whose
buildings still remain. The most beautiful of his houses
which are now to be seen in St. Giles's form two shops
on the southern side of Great Queen Street, near the
Freemasons' Tavern-probably part of a residence he is
known to have built here for lord Herbert of Cherbury,
about the year 161O.<note place="foot" n="\i">There are views of these houses and others in Parton's ' St. Giles,' as
well as some highly fanciful bird's-eye views and maps of the parish. See
curious notice of Parton in Smith's 'Book for a Rainy Day,' p. 180.</note> The area of Lincoln's Inn Fields
is always sacred to the memory of William, lord Russell,
who was beheaded there in <date value="1683">1683</date>. Other executions of
state criminals had taken place here, as that of Babington
and his six companions, in the reign of queen Elizabeth;
and, probably, lord Cobham, two hundred and fifty
years before.</p>
<p>  The parcelling out of a manor among a number of
owners has always led to the same bad results. St. Giles's
was long and is still, to some extent, another word for





<pb n="206" id="p.206"/>

an assembly of miserable tenements and poverty-stricken
tenants.  Lisson Grove, which we shall shortly have
occasion to notice more at length, though situated
between four of the most wealthy and fashionable of
our western suburbs, offers another example.  It is
interesting to contrast the history of St. George's, the
northern half of the prebendal manor of Rugmere, with
that of its less fortunate if more interesting neighbour.
Much has been done of late years to purge St. Giles's,
but only with the result of driving the lowest class into
other and remoter dens. Changing the names of streets
will not of itself improve their character, yet, until the
Peabody Gift, little attention was paid by those in
authority to the necessity of providing the poor with
suitable houses. In St. Giles's, what with the continuation of "New" Oxford Street east from Tottenham
Court Road to Holborn, the widening of Old Belton
Street, and its change into Endell Street, connecting
Broad Street and Long Acre; what with the change
of Queen Street into Museum Street, and Dyott Street
into George Street, and Brewer Street into Thorney
Street, and many other alterations of the kind, it would
puzzle any one who knew it at the beginning of the
present reign to recognise it now. Its local associations
are in many places obliterated; but Bowl Alley yet
preserves the memory of the convict's last drink as he
went up the long hill to Tyburn. The grave is still
pointed out where Derwentwater's headless body reposed for a time before its removal to Dilston ;<note place="foot" n="\i">It has lately been removed to Thorndon in Essex.</note> and the
register reminds us that it was in the parish of St. Giles
that the Great Plague of <date value="1665">1665</date> originated.</p>
<p>  The contrast between the fates of Bloomsbury and St.
Giles is like that which Hood draws between Margaret




                               <pb n="207" id="p.207"/>

</note> At first, for a short time, Bloomsbury was
a <soCalled>noble</soCalled> suburb, then it became <soCalled>respectable,</soCalled> and
respectable it has remained. While it was <soCalled>noble,</soCalled> a
few great mansions with extensive pleasure grounds, connected by country lanes, and separated by dairy farms
and tile-roofed cottages, existed, instead of the squalid
lanes and courts with which already St. Giles's was filled.
Nearest to the great western thoroughfare was Montagu
House, erected by Hooke for the first Duke of Montagu,
<soCalled>after the French manner.</soCalled>  It was burnt down in <date value="1686">1686</date>,
when, as lady Rachel Russell relates in one of her
delightful letters, the westerly wind carried sparks and
flames to the neighbouring Southampton House, and endangered its inmates, lady Rachel herself and her son,
the second duke of Bedford, then a child. Montagu
House was rebuilt, but only partially inhabited, and the
duke's coheirs joined in selling it to the nation at the
moderate price of 10,000&#x00A3;., for the reception of the Sloane
collection. The last remains of the old house, with its
pointed roofs, its deep cornices, its double lodges, and
other quaint and picturesque appendages, <soCalled>after the
French manner,</soCalled> were removed in <date value="1845">1845</date>. Two years later
the portico of the new museum was finished.</p>
<p>  The growth of the collections in the British Museum
has been very rapid. Montagu House was first employed in <date value="1753">1753</date>, when room had to be found for the
library and curiosities of Sir <persName key="Sloane, Hans">Hans Sloane</persName>, who directed
his executors to ask the merely nominal price of 20,000&#x00A3;.
for them. This sum was raised by a lottery, and a






<pb n="208" id="p.208"/>

member of Sir <persName key="Sloane, Hans">Hans Sloane</persName>'s family has ever since sat on
the board of trustees. In fact the museum is, like most
institutions of the kind in England, more or less a private
enterprise: but a large number of public functionaries
are trustees by virtue of their office. The purchase of the
Harleian manuscripts, also for a nominal sum, and the
gift by George II. of the library which successive kings
of England had accumulated, to the number of about
twenty-eight thousand printed or written volumes, raised
the library to a position of great importance. The new
buildings were commenced soon after the beginning of
the present century, and the acquisition of the Elgin
marbles for so small a sum as 35,000&#x00A3;. drew popular
attention to the museum, which immediately became an
object of pride to every Englishman. Yet with characteristic parsimony, the authorities have never seen fit
to provide these matchless sculptures with any better
pedestals than the wooden cases in which they came
from Greece.</p>
<p>  The first great Egyptian acquisition consisted in the
objects taken with the French army in 18O1. A grant
was obtained from Parliament to provide accommodation
for them, and in <date value="1804">1804</date> the Rosetta stone and several
great sarcophagi were exhibited. Naturally, the French
Egyptologists<note place="foot" n="\i">M. Pierret, in his 'Dictionnaire Archaeologique,' for example, and
later, M. Fontane, in 'Les Egyptes,' are prominent examples of this silly
jealousy, so unworthy of a great nation.</note>  not only ignore the fact that the Rosetta
stone is in the British Museum, but also forget that the
earliest success in reading the hieroglyphic characters
was obtained by a <placeName key="London">London</placeName> physician named Young,
who made out some of the proper names on the stone,
but owing to the pressure of professional duties, did not

Wilkinson, a little later, if they did not add much
to our knowledge, at least added largely to the number
of Egyptian objects, many of them, no doubt, worthless,
since we do not know whence they came, or, consequently, to what period they belong. But undoubtedly,
except in monuments of the early or pyramid period,
the British Museum ranks high as regards its Egyptian
collections, and especially papyrus rolls. The Assyrian
and Babylonian, and the coin and Greek vase collections
are unquestionably the best in any contemporary museum,
but owing to faults of system or of management, or of
economy, there are several departments still sadly deficient. Among these must be mentioned that of ancient
jewelry, and that of medieval and oriental armour.</p>
<p>  The zoological section has hitherto been most ridiculously mixed up with the various departments of antiquities. The stuffed beasts and birds and other objects of
the kind are shortly to migrate to a building erected for
them, unfortunately on a very remote and in many
respects inconvenient site. Some of the most important
parts of the collection will then for the first time become
visible to such of the general public as have leisure to
visit this distant suburb by daylight.  An adequate
print-room, and an exhibition of drawings by the great
masters are still badly wanted. It is not generally
known that the British nation is possessed of the finest
collection in the world of these priceless works: and
certainly, as a recent writer observes, no other nation
would keep them concealed.</p>
<p>  The present building is imposing in character: but
where space was of such value, it was ridiculous both to
set it so far back from the street front, and to spend
space and money on a perfectly useless peristyle. The
Ionic columns are so tall that they do not protect the






<pb n="210" id="p.210"/>

passenger from the rain, nor are they ever wanted to
shield him from the sunshine, but they were erected in
the height of the Grecian fashion, and give the building
a certain dignity wanting both to the National Gallery,
the South Kensington Museum, and the New Museum
of Natural History, with which they obviously compete.
It is a pity that the offer at a moderate price said to
have been made by the duke of Bedford of the day, of
the houses between the Museum and Oxford Street, was
not accepted. It would certainly be interesting, to say
the least, to be able to get Hawksmoor's church and
Smirke's portico into one view.</p>
<p>  Southampton House, with its great garden, stood where
now the northern side of Bloomsbury Square gives entrance to Bedford Place. It was built when Bedford
House in the Strand was removed, and stood not quite a
hundred years, for in <date value="1800">1800</date> it was pulled down, dismantled, and the contents sold. Evelyn says it contained
a pretty cedar chapel, but was too low, and the garden
too bare. Between the northern end of the garden and
the distant hills of Hampstead and Highgate there was,
in those days, but little to catch the eye, and that little
not of a very attractive kind. A few hundred yards off
was a chimney-sweeper's cottage, and where is now Little
Guildford Street, Baltimore House, the residence of a
nobleman, whose character was such that when, in <date value="1768">1768</date>,
he was tried for the forcible abduction and ill-treatment
of an unfortunate young milliner named Woodcock, he
only escaped owing to <quote>an informality in Miss Woodcock's deposition, arising evidently from the agitation of
her mind.</quote> The surroundings of this amiable earl's
residence were not incongruous. The Long Fields, as
they were called, which stretched away to the northward
and westward, were famous as a meeting-place for duellists,

and a <quote>resort of depraved wretches, whose amusements consisted chiefly in fighting pitched battles and
other disorderly sports, especially on the Sabbath day.</quote><note place="foot" n="\i">Dobie, p. 176. He adds some interesting particulars of <quote>The former
residence of the illustrious martyr of liberty, Lord William Russell</quote> (sic).
His account is quoted without acknowledgment by almost every writer on
Bloomsbury and its associations.</note>
At the north-east end of what is now       Upper Montagu
Street was the  <soCalled>Forty Footsteps Field,</soCalled> celebrated by
Miss Porter as the      scene of a sanguinary encounter
between two brothers in whose tracks no grass would
grow.   This   superstition  is frequently   alluded  to  by
writers of the end of the eighteenth century, and one of
them records regretfully his last visit, in <date value="1800">1800</date>, before
bricks and mortar finally covered the haunted site.</p>
<p>  The tide of bricks and mortar overwhelmed <placeName key="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</placeName> with remarkable rapidity. Though the north side
of Queen Square is said to have been left open, in order
that the distant view of the hills might not be interrupted,
the building speculators,<note place="foot" n="\i">The greatest of these speculators was James Burton, whose villa in the
Regent's Park is figured in Britton and Pugin (p. 88, vol. i.), and who from
small beginnings acquired an immense fortune while still comparatively
young. He devoted the remainder of his life to getting rid of it, his
prudence not having been nourished by success, and in various schemes
more or less hazardous he contrived to reduce himself to a competence.
He is commemorated in Burton Crescent; but to his son, Decimus, who
survived till <date value="1881">1881</date>, modern <placeName key="London">London</placeName> is indebted for some of its best, as well
as some of its worst, architectural effects.</note>  who, about <date value="1792">1792</date>, commenced
operations here, contrived within a period of eleven years
to add no fewer than <date value="1198">1198</date> houses to the parish, for
<placeName key="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</placeName> had now become a parish of itself, being
furnished with one of the fifty new churches built under
the Act of 171O. There was already a chapel in Queen
Square-distinguished as St. George the Martyr; the
greater part of the parish afterwards annexed to it being
taken not out of St. Giles's, but St. Andrew's, Holborn.



<pb n="212" id="p.212"/>

The new church of St. George, <placeName key="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</placeName>, was built on
a site granted or sold by lady Rachel Russell, and known
as Plough Yard. Hawksmoor's design has been ridiculed
so long that even now, when the lions and unicorns have
descended from their giddy perch at the feet of King
George near the summit of the steeple, it requires some
hardihood to praise it. Yet, since some houses on' the
north and east sides have been pulled down, and a view
opened of the body of the church, I must confess that
to my eyes it is exceedingly picturesque; while the
magnificent portico, and the quaint spire, an avowed copy
from the classical descriptions of the Mausoleum, form a
group only rivalled by St. Martin's in the Fields. Had
St. Martin's a steeple at the side, instead of overthe portico,
it might compete more successfully with St. George's.
The statue of the king on the summit is undoubtedly an
absurdity, and gave rise to many an epigram and scornful jest. Walpole <quote>wonders how the devil they got there,</quote>
speaking of the now deposed supporters. <quote>The king of
Great Britain,</quote> said another rhymer, <quote>was reckoned the
head of the Church by all Protestants, but in Bloomsbury
he was head of the steeple as well</quote>; and a variation,
quoted by Cunningham, alludes to Henry VIII., who
<quote>left the pope in the lurch.</quote></p>
<p>  Unlike St. Giles's, the parochial history of St. George's is
of the most uneventful kind, but it would be easy to compile long lists of eminent inhabitants : literary, legal, and
artistic people have crowded its precincts. Lord Mansfield
lived in Southampton Square when his library was burnt
by the Gordon rioters in <date value="1780">1780</date>. Charles Dickens had a
house in Tavistock Square for many years. Sir Antonio
Panizzi lived almost in sight of his beloved museum.
Among the very earliest tenants of the district as it was
seen by Evelyn, when he called it a noble piazza and a






                         <pb n="213" id="p.213"/>

little town, was Richard Baxter, whose wife  <quote>entered into
the saints' everlasting rest</quote> here in <date value="1681">1681</date>. Dr. Dodd,
celebrated for his sermons and his forgery, was an
<quote>eminent inhabitant,</quote> as was the victim of his fraud,
Lord Chesterfield.  <placeName key="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</placeName> retains its respectability to the present day.  Rugmere has vanished;
St. Giles's has lost caste; but <placeName key="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</placeName> is prebendal
still.</p>
<p>  The fate of the other prebendal manors was very similar. In St. Pancras there was, at the time of the Domesday survey, a separate manor, held, like St. Pancras itself,
by a canon of St. Paul's. This was, in all probability,
the same which, passing into the hands of the Cantlo or
Cantilupe family, acquired its name, and as Cantlers, with
the further corruption of Kentish Town, subsists still.
It is now subject, it is said, to a nominal rent to the prebendary, but is practically the property of the Pratt
family, having come to Charles Pratt, earl Camden, by
his marriage with the daughter and coheir of Nicholas
Jeffreys, about the middle of the last century. Somers
Town, another <soCalled>hamlet</soCalled> of St. Pancras, is, similarly, the
property of the family of which earl Somers is the
head.</p>
<p>  The old church of St. Pancras was one of the most
typical of Middlesex churches-small, low, mean, but
ancient: built originally, no doubt, of wood, mended and
patched with a little freestone begged from the builders of
St. Paul's, added to when there came to be a few more
parishioners, discarded for a mock Grecian temple in the
City Road, and finally rebuilt in <date value="1848">1848</date> in an absurd
Norman style under the name of restoration. It is now
almost surrounded with a vast network of railways, and
its churchyard and the adjoining cemetery belonging to
St. Giles's are turned into an ornamental garden; yet a



<pb n="214" id="p.214"/>

visit to Old St. Pancras is not without interest. There is
a tradition which should not be passed by without notice,
that St. Pancras was the mother church of St. Paul's: a
reference probably to the old chapel of St. Pancras at
Canterbury, in which the first Christian mass in England
was celebrated by St. Austin.<note place="foot" n="\i">See Britton and Pugin, 'Edifices of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>,' i. 146. The chapel of
St. Pancras at Canterbury was a pig-stye when I last visited its venerable
and sacred ruins.
</note> There is another tradition
to the effect that the mass was sung here later than in
any other church after its abolition by Henry VIII., and
the lonely situation of the church then and later favours
its truth. Writing soon after, Norden says, <quote>Pancras
Church standeth all alone, as utterly forsaken, old and
weatherbeaten.</quote>  He adds that folks from Kennistonne
(Kentish Town) now and then visit it, but not often,
having a chapel of their own. Till very lately, service
was only performed in the old church once a month, and
on other days at the Kentish Town chapel.</p>
<p>  The church contains few monuments of interest, but a
broken canopy remains of the tombs of the Greys, lords
of Portpoole, who are also commemorated in the name
of Gray's Inn. The churchyard was long a favourite
burial-place for Roman Catholics, for which several
reasons were assigned, one being that at a church
dedicated to the same saint in France, masses were
celebrated for the repose of the dead buried here.
Three of the monuments may be noticed. One marks
the grave of Mary Woolstonecraft Godwin, who died in
Somers Town in <date value="1797">1797</date>. Another, dated <date value="1805">1805</date>, is sacred
to the memory of Walker, author of the 'Pronouncing
Dictionary.' It has been <soCalled>restored</soCalled>  at the expense of
lady Burdett Coutts, and stands in a distant part of
the ground, approached under a railway arch. In a





                             <pb n="215" id="p.215"/>

prominent situation is the entrance to the vault of Sir
<persName key="Soane, John">John Soane</persName>, his wife and his son.<note place="foot" n="\i">'Epitaphs of Middlesex,' by F. T. Cansick.</note></p>
<p>  The new parish church is in the Euston Road, and
was extravagantly admired when it was built in <date value="1822">1822</date>.
It was one of the first results of the acquisition of the
Elgin Marbles in <date value="1816">1816</date>.  The world of taste was absorbed in imitating Greek art. The publication of several
books on the ruins of Athens, and especially the magnificent folios of Stuart and Revett, fired the ardour of
architects. Wren was discarded as completely as gothic,
and the new church of St. Pancras was designed as a
gigantic imitation-with improvements-of a little building on the hill of the Acropolis. The improvements
consisted in making the design uniform, in adding a
tower, and in projecting a semicircular apse from the
eastern end. The futility of attempting to use a Greek
temple for modern religious purposes is perhaps better
exemplified in this than in any other of the numerous
designs of the kind which sprung up in all directions.
The Inwoods, who furnished the design, made the tower
to consist of a series of circular temples set one above
the other, without meaning or purpose, except to attain
an elevation of 200 feet. A caryatid portico exactly
balanced by another, and neither having any use, complete a church as absurdly unsuitable as any in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>
for the ordinary purposes of Protestant worship. No one
thinks of using Greek temples as churches now, but we
still try to build in the gothic of the thirteenth century.
The new parish church at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> is another example
of failure, and for the same reason as the new church of
St. Pancras. Sooner or later reflecting and painstaking
architects will have to fall back on the principles of Wren,
if not upon the style he preferred: but so far they have







<pb n="216" id="p.216"/>

found it easier to take some classical building for abject
reproduction, or else to try, in the nineteenth century,
and with all the conditions altered, to imitate the comparative irregularity of the middle ages. The new church
of St. Pancras, in short, is only a degree more instructive
than the still newer old church, because the gothic architect has put no mind into his work, while the imitators
of the Erechtheum at least did what was thought the
best at the time.</p>
<p>  Tottenhall, the manor house of which was at the head
of Tottenham Court Road, where the entrance-gate posts
are still visible, is mentioned as Totehele in Domesday;
and has been leased and re-leased till the original owner
is forgotten. The first lessee whose name I have met is
John de Caleton, in <date value="1343">1343</date>. Charles II., to whom the lease
had come, gave it, in satisfaction of a debt, to Sir Henry
Wood, in <date value="1661">1661</date>. Soon after, it was the property of lady
Arlington, whose daughter, the duchess of Grafton, next
held it.<note place="foot" n="\i">Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington, one of the Cabal ministry, had an
only daughter, lady Isabella, who married the first duke of Grafton,
the son of Barbara, duchess of Cleveland, by, as was reputed, king
Charles II.</note>  Her descendant, lord Southampton, is the
present owner; and his family and titles are commemorated by Fitzroy Square and other local names well
known to artists.</p>
<p>  Fitzroy Square seems to lie out of the usual thoroughfares, and is forgotten by the regular sightseer. It was
begun in or about <date value="1790">1790</date>, and the two sides completed are
a very happy example of the skill and taste of the Adam
brothers. The north and west sides were not finished
when the peace came, and with it a reaction in prices
which put a stop to many schemes more ambitious than
the building of Fitzroy Square; it retains a strangely




                        <pb n="217" id="p.217"/>

double aspect of squalor and magnificence. Tottenhall,
or Tottenham Court, long a noted tavern, with tea-gardens
of doubtful repute adjoining, was, until the middle of the
last century, quite as suburban as Fulham is now; and
another public-house, at the next corner beyond the
Tabernacle, was reputed even sixty or seventy years ago
<soCalled>the last house in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</soCalled><note place="foot" n="\i">Hone, ' Year Book;' Thackeray's 'Virginians,' ii. 228.</note> The neighbourhood has
not profited so much as some others from being the
property of a noble family, and cannot be said ever to
have been in fashion, though Whitefield, the preacher,
drew great people out of town to hear him, and Tottenham Court Chapel, which he built, remained for many
years a very prominent memorial of the success of his
ministry. In it were buried two men remarkable in their
several ways, Toplady, the author of " Rock of Ages,"
and Bacon, the sculptor.  But the restless vulgarity
which has modernised, be-plastered and be-stuccoed
Whitefield's simple and picturesque octagon is sad as
well as disgusting.</p>
<p>   It would be easy to fill a volume with the history of
the prebendal manors of St. Paul's; but we may pass on
now to notice the next parish westward of Tottenhall.
Here we have no longer the canons of St. Paul's, but do
not find that other owners managed much better. There
is probably no district of suburban <placeName key="London">London</placeName> which has
undergone greater vicissitudes of condition, ownership,
and even name, than Tyburn.</p>
<p>   As we drive along the crowded and busy Oxford
 Street, leaving on our left the end of Bond Street, we
 descend a slight slope before we pass Stratford Place on
 our right. The slope, it is easy to see, was not always so
 slight, and the lanes on either hand lead down at a steep
 incline. At two corners, on the north side, we perceive the







<pb n="218" id="p.218"/>

same name, Marylebone Lane. It seems to be divided
into two branches, embracing a triangular piece of
ground. It is not easy at the present day to realise that
once a lonely road between grass meadows here dipped
into a hollow, and crossed a brawling brook by a bridge
under the shadow of a little country church. Whether
or no the division of the double lane betokens a similar
division of the brook, along whose banks it ran, and so
gives us a clue to the name, it is at least certain that
at the end of the fourteenth century Tyburn already bore
an evil reputation, a reputation not, we may be sure,
improved when <soCalled>gentle Mortimer</soCalled> and his companion
were brought for execution to the bleak heath on the
hill beyond in <date value="1330">1330</date>. The little church was St. John's,
Tyburn. Twice over it was robbed by marauders, who
escaped in security owing to the remoteness of the
situation: and, in <date value="1400">1400</date>, Robert Braybrook, bishop of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>, gave leave to have it removed and a new
church, nearer the village, and half-a-mile higher up the
bourne, built and consecrated as St. Mary's, so-called, of
course, from the abbey of St. Mary of Barking, by which
the manor was owned. There were already close by the
churches of St. Mary Abbots, St. Mary, Islington, and
others; so this was distinguished as St. Mary <soCalled>le
bourne.</soCalled> The vestry-room still remains near the site of
St. John's.  When the present parochial offices were
erected in <date value="1829">1829</date>, on a spot which had formerly been the
parish pound, bones and other signs of interment were
erroneously attributed, not to the former existence of the
graveyard, but to that of the gibbet.</p>
<p>  The name Tyburn has not been explained. I have
hazarded a guess above as to its possible origin, but am
far from thinking it more than a possibility. In an
ancient charter at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> we find the earliest form




                             <pb n="219" id="p.219"/>

of the word. This is a deed of gift or confirmation
to the Abbey, and though not contemporary, may contain a correct copy of the boundaries of St. Margaret's.
It purports to be dated in 951, and to confirm a grant
made by Offa.   Tyburn is called in it "Teoburne."
Mr. Waller derives the name from the division of its
later course into two streams.<note place="foot" n="\i">J. G. Waller, 'The Tybourne and the Westbourne,' read before the
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> and Middlesex Archaeological Society.</note> In Domesday it is
Tiburne, and <quote>always lay, and lies, in the church of
Barking </quote>; that is, it belonged from time immemorial to
the abbey at that place. It was then, and long after,
wholly agricultural. There was pasture for cattle, and
woods of beech or oak for the feeding of pigs. In the
time of the Confessor it had been worth a hundred shillings, but was now valued at fifty.</p>
<p>  Such was Tyburn at the Norman Conquest. The
brook from which the name was derived divided it from
the manor of Lylleston, or Lisson, the second portion of
the same parish. Its course may easily be traced still
in the windings of Marylebone Lane, which probably
marks the site of an ancient village on the left, or eastern
bank. I have already endeavoured, with the help of Mr.
Waller's map and description, to show what that course
was with respect to the modern conditions.<note place="foot" n="\i">See vol. i. chap. i.</note> </p>
  <p>When St. John's church was removed and St. Mary's
built, the village, so to speak, turned its back on the
Via Dolorosa of the gallows, and dropping the old name
became known by that of the new church, a name it has
borne ever since.  Henceforth Tyburn was identified
with the gallows, and moved with them further and
further west, until at length they rested finally near the
modern site of the Marble Arch, while the thoroughfare






<pb n="220" id="p.220"/>

we call Oxford Street was the Tyburn Road, and Park
Lane, which led up from <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, was Tyburn
Lane.</p>
<p>  The corporation of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> acquired, by lease or
otherwise, some fields on either side of the brook, near
the spot at which Oxford Street is crossed. As early
as <date value="1237">1237</date> leave was obtained by Gilbert Sandford to
convey water to the city from Tyburn in leaden pipes.<note place="foot" n="\i">Waller, ut supra.</note>
Here, in <date value="1239">1239</date>, water-pipes were laid down, and as many
as nine "conduits " or reservoirs<note place="foot" n="\i">It is often stated that Conduit Street takes its name from one of these
reservoirs. This must be an error. Water does not usually run up hill.
If there was a conduit and a conduit mead here they must have belonged
to a different system-perhaps for the supply of St. James's or <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</note> were dotted about on
the neighbouring slopes. At an annual visit the mayor
and aldermen inspected their springs, and a dinner,
without which no civic occasion would have been complete, was eaten in a banqueting-house erected on the
site of Stratford Place. On the 18th September, <date value="1562">1562</date>,
for example, we read in Strype that the lord mayor,
aldermen, and many worshipful persons attended to see
the conduit heads; then, turning aside into the wild
woodland of Marylebone, they hunted a hare; next they
dined, and after dinner hunted a fox, when  <quote>there was
great cry for a mile, and at length the hounds killed him
at the end of St. Giles's, with great hollowing and blowing of horns at his death.</quote></p>
<p>  The introduction of the New River in <date value="1620">1620</date> rendered
Tyburn water unnecessary to the city, and before the
middle of the century the conduits were leased away.
The suburbs north of the Strand had by this time grown
large enough to require a regular supply, and a comparatively large reservoir for the districts about Covent

no longer wanted, and were arched over. The banqueting-house was pulled down, and its site let on lease.
Edward Stratford, afterwards earl of Aldborough, took
the ground and projected a magnificent architectural
scheme: but only Stratford Place itself was built, and
even that was not completed for many years.     The
banqueting-house stood near the highway in Mill Hill
Field,<note place="foot" n="\i">There is still a Mill Hill Place, a lane off Wimpole Street; the real
conduit mead was on the other side of the brook in Lylleston, and will
be noticed further on.</note>  and we hear of a lonely tavern, where now
Welbeck Street joins Wigmore Street, at which pedestrians stopped to look to their pistols before crossing the
fields to the village of "Lisson Green." Stratford Place,
commenced in <date value="1744">1744</date>, was not finished for about half a
century. General Strode, an eccentric soldier who set a
statue of the duke of Cumberland in Cavendish Square,
placed a column opposite Aldborough House to  <quote>commemorate the naval victories of Great Britain,</quote> with a
magniloquent inscription, in which a hope is expressed
that the column may stand for ever, " <foreign lang="LA">in secula stet</foreign>," and
the glory of Britain increase. In <date value="1805">1805</date> the foundations
gave way and the perennial monument was removed,
having stood just six years.</p>
<p>  The building of Stratford Place, which stands partly
across the brook, caused various complications: and to
this day Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, runs up to
the back of the houses on the east side, and begins again
to the west.</p>

Mildmay, who remembered having shot a woodcock on
the site of Conduit Street, he is probably mistaken in
referring to the neighbourhood of Bond Street, but there
is little now to remind us of green fields or running water
in either place. Every few years one of the walled-up
cisterns is discovered under the foundations of old
houses. A stone used to mark the site of one near the
point at which Marylebone Lane crosses Wigmore Street;
another was found as far off as the top of North Audley

the thirteenth century we find Robert de Vere in possession of Tyburn. His daughter carried it to the earls
of Warren and Surrey, from whom it passed to their
heirs, the earls of Arundel. On the death of Richard
Fitzalan, fourth earl, in <date value="1397">1397</date>, it was partitioned among
his coheirs. Some of the best families in England seem
to have had a share in the newly-named St. Marylebone.
Berkeleys, Neviles, and Howards divided three-quarters
of it, and one quarter seems to have gone to Henry V.,
as heir of the earls of Derby. About the end of the
fifteenth century, however, three of the four were united
by Thomas Hobson, who bought them up one by one.</p>
<p>  I should like to know something more about Thomas
Hobson. When I come to speak of the adjoining manor
of Lylleston I shall have occasion to mention him or his
son and namesake again. At one time he seems to have
owned an estate which stretched from the Edgware Road
to Rathbone Place, an estate which, at the present day,
would have made him one of the richest subjects in

Europe. He might have founded a great ducal family.
I dare say his descendants are still extant. Perhaps one
of them was the Cambridge carrier whose dog is celebrated for his pride. Perhaps another, or the same,
offered undergraduates Hobson's choice of horses. The
name is not more ignoble than that of Smithson, and
might have been improved. It is nearly as good as
Ogle, or Holles. It is full as old as Cavendish. We
shall meet with several of these names among the ducal
owners of Tyburn: but not with that of Hobson, for his
son, in <date value="1544">1544</date>, exchanged the manor with Henry VIII. for
lands elsewhere, and the Hobson family sank once more
into its pristine obscurity.</p>
<p>  Queen Elizabeth let the lands of Tyburn, first to one
lessee then to another, at a rental of 161. 11s. 8d., and in
<date value="1611">1611</date>, James I. sold them to Edward Forset, one of
queen Elizabeth's tenants, for 829&#x00A3;. 3s. 4d.  Forset's
daughter and coheiress was Arabella, wife of Thomas
Austen, and in <date value="1710">1710</date> Sir John Austen, her son, sold
Tyburn, or Marylebone, to John Holles, duke of Newcastle, for 17,500&#x00A3;. The rental had by this time increased
to 900&#x00A3;. a year: being about the rental of a single house
in Cavendish Square at the present day. In all these
transactions Marylebone Park was specially reserved by
the crown.  A number of sub-leases fell in about the
end of the last century, and the suggestion of John
White, the architect of the Portland estate, that the
park, which was then half farm, half village-common,
subject to encroachments and all the usual forms of
ill-usage, should be taken up and properly laid out, was
acted upon, with the fine expanse of the Regent's Park
as a result. Some of the minor leaseholders are commemorated by street names, as Peter Hinde, who farmed
the park in <date value="1754">1754</date>. There were three separate farms,






<pb n="224" id="p.224"/>

and the last of the leases, which had been purchased by
the duke of Portland, did not fall in till <date value="1811">1811</date>. Foley
House, the residence of lord Foley, who projected a
mansion on such a scale that the two stone houses on
the north side of Cavendish Square are said to have
been intended for lodges, stopped the way from Regent
Street to the new park, and caused the laying out of Portland Place at its present extravagant width of 120 feet in
order not to interrupt the view. The Langham Hotel,
built on the site of Foley House, has fallen heir to this
advantageous situation. Foley Street, originally Ogle
Street, having fallen into disrepute, has become Langham
Street.</p>
<p>  But by far the largest part of the old manor is that
which Sir John Austen sold to the duke of Newcastle.
Here and there the duke's successors made additional
purchases, and at the beginning of the present century
the estate extended from Primrose Hill to Oxford
Street; and from the brook, at Marylebone Lane, with
the short interruption of the city conduit estate, eastward to Hanway Court. In shape, therefore, it is something like a T reversed, and comprises almost every
possible variety of town residence, from palaces to
tenements.</p>
<p>  The duke of Newcastle was illustrious chiefly for his
wealth in days when wealth meant political power and
social advancement.  He is buried in the statesmen's
transept in Westminster Abbey, under a cenotaph by
Gibbs which is well worthy of his architectural fame.
Gibbs himself, who better deserved Westminster Abbey,
is buried in the little church which was then deemed
sufficient for the inhabitants of the duke's great manor.
The duke's titles and offices are set forth at considerable
length on his monument, but the cause of them all is

only alluded to-- <quote>His personal merit gave a lustre that
needed not the addition of the great wealth he possessed.</quote> Burnet calls him  <quote>the richest subject that had
been in the kingdom for some ages,</quote> and it must be
allowed that his daughter, <quote>the lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles Harley,</quote> as she describes herself, spared no
expense on the sculpture.</p>
<p>  Lady Henrietta was his only child, and on his death,
in <date value="1711">1711</date>, inherited Tyburn. The same year her husband,
by the elevation of his father, Robert Harley, to the
earldoms of Oxford and Mortimer, became lord
Harley, and in <date value="1724">1724</date> succeeded him in the higher titles.</p>
<p>  Within the last few years a quaint if not very beautiful memorial of this second earl, Edward, and his rich
wife, has been removed. The vane of the central building of Oxford Market bore their initials, and the date
<date value="1721">1721</date>. Oxford Mansion, a series of flats, occupies the
site now. The northern row of houses in the Tyburn
Road was completed the year after lord Oxford succeeded to his father's title, and the new thoroughfare
was named in his honour, Oxford Street. It then extended from Marylebone Lane to Tottenham Court
Road, or exactly from one end to the other of the manor
of Tyburn. <soCalled>New</soCalled> Oxford Street was made through
the <soCalled>rookeries</soCalled> thirty years ago, but in Bloomsbury,
and serves to connect the older part of the road with
Holborn by a more direct course than that through High
Street, St. Giles's. Finally, the western part of the street
-from Marylebone Lane to the foot of Edgware Road-
leading through the manor of Lylleston, was completed,
and after having long been Oxford Road, became a
street also.<note place="foot" n="\i">Rathbone Place was built by Captain Rathbone, a lessee, in <date value="1718">1718</date>:

<p>  Like his father, earl Edward was a great collector of
old books. The Harleian MSS. seem never to have
been kept in the manor-house of St. Marylebone, as
some have asserted.  In fact, I do not think the
Holles or Harley family ever lived in the manorhouse. It stood near the top of High Street, and was
occupied by the lessee for the time being of the park
farms. The gardens were celebrated for their beauty,
and formed a public resort as early as the time
of Pepys, who praises them; but in the time of Gay
they had already acquired a doubtful reputation. Yet
here some of Handel's music was performed for the first
time. A letter, quoted by Thomas Smith,<note place="foot" n="\i">Smith's 'Parish of St. Marylebone,' p. 33.</note> contains an
amusing anecdote, in which the great composer appears
in a more amiable light than usual. He was walking in
the gardens with an old clergyman named Fountayne,
who lived at that time in the manor-house, when the
band struck up a new piece. <quote>Come,</quote> said Handel,
 <quote>let us sit down and listen to this piece, I want to know
your opinion of it.</quote> After some time Mr. Fountayne
observed, <quote>It is not worth listening to; it's very poor
stuff.</quote> <quote>You are right, Mr. Fountayne,</quote> said Handel,
 <quote>it is very poor stuff-I thought so myself when I had
finished it.</quote> On the site of the gardens stands Beaumont
Street, and near it, in High Street, is a large furniture
repository. This was the library of the Harley family.</p>
<p>  This celebrated collection was the result of perseverance and liberality exerted by the two first earls
during a long series of years. The second earl, in particular, spared neither pains nor expense in its formation,
and that he was no mere collector of the kind fashionable
a century later may be judged from his letters to the
agents adroad and at home who found him treasures, as






                             <pb n="227" id="p.227"/>

well as from the notes which still remain in so many of
the books. Great as the collection was, and priceless as
it would be now, the trustees of the British Museum
acquired it for 10,000&#x00A3;., and the arms of the Harleys,
with their angelic supporters, are familiar to thousands
who have cause to remember gratefully the husband of
the heiress of St. Marylebone.</p>
<p>  Her only daughter, Margaret, married William Bentinck, second duke of Portland, and the present duke is
the owner of the estate.</p>
<p>  The wife of John Holles, duke of Newcastle, was an
heiress of the Cavendishes of Welbeck. The Harleys
were originally of Wigmore Castle. We are thus furnished with a clue to the names of the streets in the
eastern part of the parish. Henrietta and Margaret
Streets are called after the successive heiresses ; Welbeck
and Wigmore Streets after their country seats; Harley
and Holles Streets after their fortunate husbands.
Oxford Square has become Cavendish Square.</p>
<p>  One street, the least and latest named of all, deserves
a separate notice. <persName key="Gibbon, Edward">Edward Gibbon</persName>'s house, in <date value="1776">1776</date>, was
in Bentinck Street: he dates the preface to the 'Decline
and Fall' June 1st, in that year, from No. 7, which, in a
letter to his friend, lord Sheffield, he calls <quote>the best
house in the world.</quote> His library was at the back, as
we gather from an expression in another letter. Writing
from Lausanne, he says his books have been arranged in
a room <quote>full as good as that in Bentinck Street, with
this difference, indeed, that instead of looking on a stone
court twelve feet square, I command an unbounded
prospect.</quote></p>
<p>  The western manor of this great parish, like the
eastern, was, at the time of the Domesday Survey, in
religious hands. It is enumerated among lands given in




<pb n="228" id="p.228"/>

alms, "<foreign lang="LA">in elemosina data</foreign>," when it was held by a lady
named Eideva. It had belonged T.R.E. to Edward, the
son of Suain, a vassal of the king. As early as <date value="1338">1338</date> it
was in the possession of the Knights of St. John at
<placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName>, and contained, as we are told,<note place="foot" n="\i">Hospitallers, Camden Soc., <date value="1857">1857</date>, by Lambert B. Larking. So completely had the name of Lylleston fallen into oblivion, that Mr. Larking, in
his index, adds "query Littleton ? " and makes no attempt to identify it
with Tyburn.
</note> twenty
acres of meadow and a hundred acres of wood,
the rest, we may infer, being barren heath or furze.
Even so late as two centuries ago it was almost bare
of houses, except near the middle, where Lisson-
properly Lylleston-Green closely adjoined Paddington, and both formed a kind of village on the Edgware Road. Sir William of Clyf held it from the
Hospitallers, and paid 10&#x00A3;. a year rent. He had a villa
on it, and probably hawked and hunted, and drew the
long bow in the forest, as freely as if St. John's Wood
was a hundred miles from <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.     His house was
probably on the spot centuries later covered by the
manor-house, now converted into Queen Charlotte's
Hospital. We hear no more of Lylleston for a century
and a half; but in the meantime the gallows had
travelled out from Tyburn and were probably well
established at the south-western corner of the estate,
or opposite the modern site of the Marble Arch;
for in <date value="1512">1512</date>, when the lord prior <persName key="Docwra, Thomas">Thomas Docwra</persName>,
granted a lease for fifty years to John and Johan
Blennerhasset, at least two gibbets are mentioned. The
farm thus granted for fifty years was exactly conterminous with the present Portman estate.   Lisson
Green, Lisson Grove, and St. John's Wood were not
included in it : but we have a list of the fields which is





                              <pb n="229" id="p.229"/>

very interesting to the modern topographer.<note place="foot" n="\i">Among them were Great Gibbet Field, Little Gibbet Field, Hawkfield, Brockstand, Tassal Croft, Boys Croft, Furze Croft, and Shepcott
Haws. Each of these names has its meaning. Hawkfield and Tassel Croft
refer to falconry. Boys is, of course, the French bois, a wood. Shepcott
is a fold. Brockstand is the badger's stane or stone. The rest are
obvious,</note> These
lands had been in the occupation of Thomas Hobson,
and were let for 8&#x00A3;. a year. The names of the fields
are most valuable. From them we learn not only that
people were hanged here, but that they were hanged in
chains: that the district was used for field sports: that
much of it was under wood, and some of it bushy.
Such was the corner farm on which many of the best
streets in <placeName key="London">London</placeName> now stand. It comprised in all about
270 acres, and may be reckoned one of the wealthiest
estates in England.  The exact situation of the six
fields can no longer be ascertained, but we cannot be
far wrong in supposing that the gibbets stood near the
highway, perhaps between Quebec Street and Orchard
Street, and the  <soCalled>Furzes</soCalled>  and  Haws, near a depression,
formerly, perhaps, almost a ravine, which crosses behind
Montagu House, and runs parallel to Upper Berkeley
Street, a little to the northward.</p>
<p>  As we have seen already Thomas Hobson missed his
chances of founding a great family but they were eagerly
seized on by chief justice Portman, who, in <date value="1532">1532</date>, bought
from the executors of the Blennerhassets the reversion
of their house, and afterwards, in the reign of queen
Mary, obtained the land in fee simple.</p>
<p>  To trace the further descent to the present owners
would be but tedious, except in so far as it explains the
street nomenclature of the district. The male line terminated with a grandson of Sir William Portman, and the
estate went to one of the Seymours, a descendant of the




<pb n="230" id="p.230"/>

great Protector.  It reverted, however, eventually, to
<persName key="Berkeley, William">William Berkeley</persName>, whose mother, a Speke, had been a
niece of the last Portman. Thus we have Berkeley
Street, Seymour Street, and Portman Square. From
Orchard Portman, in Somerset, and Bryanstone, in
Dorset, we get another batch of names, while two
Quebec Streets and two Adam Streets<note place="foot" n="\i">One now re-named Seymour Place.</note> furnish us with
the general date of the buildings (<date value="1759">1759</date>), and the name
of the architects.</p>
<p>  The farm in the occupation of Sir William of Clyf
was at least double the size of that which was rented
by Thomas Hobson, who, in fact, had only the southwestern corner, which was all he transmitted to his
successors the Portmans. The rest of Clyfs leasehold
comprised at least four later holdings, all of which
must be mentioned. The Eyre estate, partly on the
slope of Hampstead Hill, but chiefly within the manor
of Lylleston, consisting of 340 acres, was granted by
Charles II. in satisfaction of a debt to lord Wotton.
Another estate, lying along the Edgware Road, was
bequeathed by John Lyon to Harrow School. A third
was that portion of the City Conduit estate, which
lay on the western side of the brook. This was the
real  <soCalled>Conduit Mead,</soCalled> to which I referred above. It was
long the property of a family named Edwardes, and from
its interrupting the communication east and west between
the Cavendish Square and Portman Square districts is
frequently mentioned in the parish annals.  By the
threat of an Act of Parliament, the tenant was eventually
brought to reason, and Wigmore Street was continued as
Edwardes Street,<note place="foot" n="\i">Now merged in Lower Seymour Street.</note> Lower Seymour Street, the south side
of Portman Square, and Upper Seymour Street to





                         <pb n="231" id="p.231"/>

Edgware Road. This was about <date value="1780">1780</date>, and the neighbouring Manchester Square was completed about the
same time. The Spanish chapel close by was built for
the accommodation of the Spanish ambassador, who
rented Manchester House;<note place="foot" n="\i">Now Hertford House, the residence of Sir Richard Wallace.</note> and the spiritual wants of
the parishioners of all denominations are well supplied,
so far as church room is concerned.</p>
<p>  The church of the whole parish of St. Marylebone,
removed from the lonely corner at Tyburn, was planted
in High Street, and still, substantially, stands, though
more or less completely rebuilt at different times, as " the
parish chapel." There is not much of the picturesque
left in it, but the interior has been immortalised by
Hogarth as the scene of the Rake's Marriage. The living
went through all the usual vicissitudes, but the abbey of
Barking does not seem ever to have held the advowson.
At one time it belonged to cardinal Wolsey, at another
to Thomas Hobson-who, by the way, paid the clergyman 13 shillings a year-and having eventually come to
the Forsets, went at last to the dukes of Portland, and
was bought, under an Act of Parliament, by the government in <date value="1821">1821</date>. In <date value="1650">1650</date> the minister had 15&#x00A3;. a year;
but as the population increased it is to be hoped the
emoluments were higher. A manuscript diary, which
occurs appropriately enough among the Harleian Collection, contains a notice of Mr. Randolph Ford, who served
the parish between <date value="1711">1711</date> and <date value="1724">1724</date>, from which it appears
that on a single day his duties were as follows:-He
began the day by marrying six couples-perhaps
Hogarth's Rake among them-then he read service and
preached, churching six women afterwards.  In the
afternoon he read and preached again, but it was not till
then that the real work of the day can be said to have





<pb n="232" id="p.232"/>

commenced, for we are told that he christened thirty-
two children, six of them at home, and proceeded to
bury thirteen corpses, reading the whole service over
each of them separately. From his address in the register
book it appears that this indefatigable clergyman lived
<quote>at the Highlander, Little Suffolk Street, <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>,</quote>
and had probably, therefore, a long walk before and after
his day's labours.</p>
<p>  In Hogarth's print a spider has spun a web over the
poor-box, and that his view is probably accurate may be
judged from  his reproduction of the lines by which
Edward Forset, whom I have mentioned already more
than once, pointed out his burial-place :
<quote rend="blockquote">  THESE : PEWES : VNSCRVD : AND : TAN : IN : SVNDER
  IN : STONE : THERS: GRAVEN : WHAT : IS : VNDER
  <lb/>TO :WIT : A: VALT : FOR : BVRIAL : THERE : IS

  <p>The new church was built in <date value="1817">1817</date>, after many delays,
and though one contemporary writer calls it " one of the
handsomest structures of the kind in the metropolis," it
is eminently commonplace, and not worthy to compare
for a moment with Hawksmoor's long-despised St.
George's.  In a century architectural taste had not
greatly improved; but the chapels of ease of this parish,
which are older, are not more beautiful. St. Peter's,
Vere Street, formerly Oxford Chapel, had the advantage
of Gibbs for its architect, but is a very poor specimen of
the <soCalled>Queen Anne</soCalled>  style; and is chiefly remarkable now
as the scene, for many years, of the labours of Frederick
Denison  Maurice.   The interior has recently been
<soCalled>restored</soCalled> in the so-called queen Anne style.<note place="foot" n="\i">This is, I believe, the first application of this style to a purpose for
  which gothic has so long been used. Quebec Chapel and Brunswick

other chapels in the eastern part of the parish are
St. James's, in Westmorland Street, formerly Welbeck
Chapel; and St. Paul's, of which I have spoken
above. There are modern district churches also, built
about the same time as the new St. Marylebone;
and a small chapel situated in Margaret Street, first
used in <date value="1789">1789</date>, was on the site of a church now celebrated as one of the most magnificent buildings of its
kind in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</p>
<p>  The church of All Souls, Langham Place, has been
alternately admired and criticised, till all that can now
be said about it is that the design suits the situation
admirably, and that if it is absolutely necessary to fit a
gothic spire to a heathen temple in order to make
a Christian church of it, Nash's very original device
will do as well as another. The church was consecrated
in <date value="1824">1824</date>.</p>
<p>  In the western half of the parish is also a large
number of new churches, of which very few require
notice.  The old chapels, in Baker Street (Portman
Chapel), Upper Berkeley Street (Brunswick Chapel),
and Quebec Street (Quebec Chapel), are chiefly remarkable for the way in which the interiors have been
modernised without undue interference with the original
fabric. At Quebec Chapel the overflowing congregations
brought together by the late dean Alford and the
present bishop (Magee) of Peterborough, are still remembered. St. Thomas's, Orchard Street, is a new and
handsome gothic structure, and so is the church in
Nutford Place, erected on the site of a cholera hospital,
which during the great epidemic of <date value="1849">1849</date> was never required for the parish, there not having been a single
case in St. Marylebone. It is appropriately dedicated
to <quote>St. Luke, the beloved physician.</quote>






<pb n="234" id="p.234"/>

  St. Mary's, Bryanston Square, which is now the mother
church of this division of the parish, was built by Smirke
in <date value="1824">1824</date>, and shows how, with Nash's round temple for a
portico, a handsome tower or spire of suitable style may
be erected.  <soCalled>Froggy Dibdin,</soCalled> the bibliographer, was the
first incumbent.</p>
<p>  It would be impossible to make anything like a complete list of the eminent inhabitants of the parish of
St. Marylebone. I have already spoken of Gibbon, but
he is only one of a large number of literary men who
have lived in it at one time or another. Sir Arthur
Helps died in Lower Berkeley Street, where he was on
a visit, in <date value="1875">1875</date>. Talleyrand once lived in Manchester
Square. Mrs. Siddons died in Upper Baker Street, in
the last house on the east side, almost facing into
Regent's Park.  <soCalled> George Eliot</soCalled> lived for many years at
South Bank. Landseer died at his house in St. John's
Wood Road, in <date value="1873">1873</date>. Sir Thomas Picton, who fell at
Waterloo, had a house in Edwardes Street.</p>
<p>  Of the illustrious dead buried in the old church, I
may mention besides James Gibbs, the architect, who
died in <date value="1754">1754</date>, Humphrey Wanley, the Harley librarian
(d. <date value="1726">1726</date>). Dr. Johnson's friend Baretti (d. <date value="1789">1789</date>), and
<persName key="Wesley, Charles">Charles Wesley</persName>, the hymn-writer (d. <date value="1788">1788</date>). In the
parish cemetery, Paddington Street, a large number of
remarkable people were buried before its final closure:
from Canning's father; Hoyle, who wrote on games; and
<quote> the gallant, good Riou,</quote> one of Nelson's captains, killed
at Copenhagen; down to Mr. Rawlinson, <quote>First Master
Cook to his most beloved and revered Royal Master,
George III.,</quote> and Mr. John Castles, <quote>late of the Great
Grotto, whose great ingenuity in shell-work gained him
universal applause.</quote></p>
<p>  If the name of Tyburn can be said to survive at all, it






                         <pb n="235" id="p.235"/>

is in a district far west of the original manor, as I have
endeavoured to show. Tyburnia at the present day is
the city of palaces north of the park, along the Bayswater Road, and is all within the parish of Paddington.
An iron tablet in the park railing facing Edgware Road
marks the site of a turnpike, and dates its removal:-
<quote>Here stood Tyburn Gate, <date value="1829">1829</date>.</quote></p>
<p>  It is difficult, even with the help of the prints, maps,
and drawings of the Crace and other collections to form
an idea of the aspect of this corner a hundred years ago,
or to recall the scenes of horror which took place at
executions on the bare hill to the westward.  But,
instead of the great street of Edgware Road, with its
double row of large shops, instead of the tall houses of
Connaught Place, instead of the seemingly endless vista
of terraces and gardens facing the park there were no
houses on the left hand, looking along Edgware Road,
and none on the right, looking along the Uxbridge Road.
There was a wall, by no means uniform or regular,
dividing the park from the road; and about half-way to
Kensington Gardens was the ranger's lodge, opening
with a pair of gates nearly opposite the modern Albion
Street.  The inclosure for the burial-ground of St.
George's stood out as a prominent feature in the landscape-a landscape which showed, here and there a
farmhouse or a strawyard; here and there a lonely
tavern with a swinging sign and a water-trough; and for
the rest was made up of a long slope down to the Bayswater, or Westbourne, with, in the foreground, crossed
by footpaths, a bare triangular space decorated only by
the awful presence of the gallows.</p>

Square and Stanhope Place is often asserted to
be actually on the site occupied by the gallows-an idle
tradition, as the gallows were not always on the same
spot, and were certainly, during the last few years, only
erected for each execution, and then on the roadway
itself. Another idle story is, that remains indicating the
burial of bodies under the gallows were found at the
corner of Connaught Place. In one publication it was
asserted that a cartload of bones was removed and
buried in a pit dug in the mews; and that this cartload
"doubtless" contained the bones of Cromwell.<note place="foot" n="\i">I followed this tradition implicitly in my' In and Out of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>'; and
was kindly set right by the best authority, the owner and occupier of
Arklow House itself. The words <quote>numerous bones</quote> were used by a
writer in ' Notes and Queries,' 9th May, <date value="1860">1860</date>, p. 400.</note> As a
matter of fact no such discovery was ever made. When
the houses in Connaught Place were built, a careful
search was instituted lest any such fragments should
exist. A single bone, which may be a portion of the
lower jaw of a human being, was found, and is carefully
preserved. But that was all. There are few parts of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>, especially along the course of an ancient
Roman road, where remains of some kind, and generally
sepulchral, may not be found.</p>
<p>  This corner, and the inclosing sides, north-west by
Edgware Road to Kensal Green, and west by the

<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, near what used to be the Gravel Pits, but
has now become Notting Hill Gate, is the parish of
Paddington, and includes the two manors of Paddington
and Westbourne. They were divided by the little stream
which was the original source of the Serpentine, but is
now lost to sight in an underground sewer.   Brook

the history of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, we have had occasion to
show how Westbourne was probably at a very early
period separated from the original  <quote>manor of the church
of St. Peter,</quote> and that it may be identified with the
holding of Bainiard. Of <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName> we only know that
if it was separated from the manor of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> at
some time between the Domesday survey and the
middle of the twelfth century, it was restored to its
original owners through the care of abbot Walter, who
in <date value="1191">1191</date>, bought it from Richard and William de
Padinton, and left it to the abbey for the good of his
soul, and to provide <quote>fine manchets, cakes, crumpets,
cracknells, and wafers,</quote> with a gallon of wine for each
monk, and other indulgences, on the anniversary of his
death.<note place="foot" n="\i">There is a doubtful charter in Kemble's 'Codex Diplomaticus,
(mccxxiii.), in which St. Dunstan has the credit of adding Paddington to
the possessions of the Abbey. The two statements are not inconsistent, as
Richard and William may have been leaseholders, but it is improbable.</note></p>
<p>  By what means the manor of Westbourne came to
belong to the abbey of Westminster I have not been
able to ascertain. In <date value="1222">1222</date>, a decree was made in order
to terminate a dispute between the abbey and the see of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>. In this decree Westburne and Padyngtoun are
named together among the possessions of the abbey, or
to speak more exactly, are said to <quote>belong to the parish
of St. Margaret.</quote></p>
<p>  When the religious houses were suppressed Henry VIII.
made <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName> part of the endowment of the new see
of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.<note place="foot" n="\i">See chap. xvi.</note> This was in <date value="1541">1541</date>, and the manors,
though now both in ecclesiastical hands, were never
united again, as, when the new bishopric was abolished,
<placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName> went towards the endowment of the see of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName>, while Westbourne remained to the dean and




<pb n="238" id="p.238"/>

chapter of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, who had received it from
Henry VIII. and have retained it ever since.</p>
<p>  The bishops now exercise their rights through the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners; but a very determined
attempt was made by a dignitary, no less respectable
than archbishop Sheldon, to alienate <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName>, as
the canons of St. Paul's had alienated their estates. At
the time of the Commonwealth, <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName>, like other
church estates, was sold; but at the Restoration, Sheldon,
then bishop of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, claimed it for his use, and
obtaining it, gave it on a long lease to his sons, Joseph
and Daniel. His family are said to have enjoyed the
revenues of the manor for above eighty years. Although
holding under so unjust an arrangement, the Sheldons
deserved well of the place, and when the old church, a
kind of chapel, originally, to St. Margaret's, became
ruinous, they built a new one. This new church, which
was consecrated in <date value="1678">1678</date>, was dedicated to St. James.
The older one is sometimes supposed to have been
dedicated to St. Katherine, but on insufficient evidence.<note place="foot" n="\i">The history of <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName>, little as there is to tell, is unusually
involved, owing to the carelessness of the historians. Timbs says the
Sheldons built their church in the reign of Charles I.; but this statement
is capped by another writer, who, after assigning the right date to
St. James's, goes on to say it was decorated in accordance with the wishes
of queen Elizabeth, and confounds the burial-ground with that in
Paddington Street, St. Marylebone, and Paddington Green with Westbourne Green.
</note>
The existing church of St. Mary, Paddington Green, was
built by local subscription in <date value="1788">1788</date>, and is described
shortly afterwards as <quote>seated on an eminence, finely
embosomed in venerable elms.</quote> After some years, even
this new church became too small for the rapidly
growing parish; and there are now not only some half-
dozen district churches, but the church at Paddington

                      <pb n="239" id="p.239"/>

Green has been deposed from its ascendancy. The parish
for the fourth time changed its patron and reverted
to its former saint, when the new and handsome but
terribly stiff perpendicular church of St. James was
erected in <date value="1845">1845</date>, and made parochial. This revival or
awakening of religious enthusiasm in Paddington took
place at an unfortunate moment in the history of architecture. The least objectionable of the new churches
is that in the square known as Lancaster Gate. It is
absurdly and incongruously placed among stucco palaces
of an Italian style, but from the Serpentine bridge,
where the spire alone can be seen reflected in the water,
through a vista of trees, it forms a pleasing feature
of one of the few <soCalled>bits</soCalled> of landscape in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. On
the whole, I am inclined to prefer the quaint classicality of old St. Mary's to the mock gothic of any of its
successors.</p>
<p>  Until lately Paddington has had few eminent inhabitants-nay, few inhabitants of any kind. The bishops,
after whom so many of the streets and roads are called,
never lived in their manor-house on the east side of the
green; and a few years ago the house itself was pulled
down. By a curious chance, however, though many of
the great folk of the world did not affect Paddington in
their lives, it has been the burial-place of more remarkable people than even Westminster Abbey itself. In
<date value="1764">1764</date>, the churchwardens of St. George's, Hanover Square,
lord Boston and Mr. Long of Rood Ashton, in Wiltshire, bought for their newly-established parish a plot of
land for a burial-ground.  It was situated a long way
out of town on the bare hillside, westward of the place
of execution, at the corner of Edgware Road. It must
have presented a sufficiently forbidding aspect when
first inclosed. Now it looks rather pleasant, and green







<pb n="240" id="p.240"/>

with trees and flower-beds, when viewed from the
backs of the houses on the west side of Connaught
Square, or the south side of Connaught Street.<note place="foot" n="\i">Formerly Upper Berkeley Street West. The churchwardens took it
from Sir Thomas Frederick, who had a lease for three lives from the
bishop. It is described as "five acres in Tyburn field." 'Malcolm,'
iv. 236.</note>  Here
were buried some whom the world will not easily forget,
though they may never even have seen their last resting-
place in the time of their mortal lives. In <date value="1768">1768</date>, <persName key="Sterne, Laurence">Laurence
Sterne</persName>'s body was brought to it from the lodging-house<note place="foot" n="\i">No. 41, <soCalled>a silk bag shop,</soCalled> now Agnew &#x0026; Co.'s, the picture dealers.</note>
in Bond Street, where he died; and was buried without
so much as a gravestone. Some years later two Freemasons, out of admiration for his genius, set up a stone
against the western wall with a long inscription; but it
would be rash to say it stands at the actual place of his
interment. In the <soCalled>reserved portion</soCalled> of the ground,
where rich people were able to protect their bodies from
contamination with meaner mould, are some interesting
monuments; and among them the urn of a lady who
was cremated in accordance with the provisions of her
will in <date value="1808">1808</date>. The cemetery is entered under an archway which passes between a chapel and the house of
the keeper.  In the chapel are some curious tablets,
including that of the famous Mrs. Molony (d. <date value="1839">1839</date>), who
<quote>was cousin to Burke, commonly called the sublime,</quote>
who was <quote rend="blockquote">a superb drawer in water-colours, which was
much admired in the exhibition,</quote> and of whom     Mr.
Edward Molony, of Castle Molony, her husband, asserts
that <quote rend="blockquote">of such are the kingdom of heaven.</quote><note place="foot" n="\i">The whole inscription may be found in Mr. Ravenshaw's ' Antiente

a tablet to the memory of Sir Thomas Picton, whose

Street, was buried in the little vault under this chapel.
After the death and funeral of the duke of Wellington,
it was removed to St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>
<p>  At the most distant spot that can possibly be found
within the limits of the parish is the great cemetery of
Kensal Green, the bleakest, dampest, most melancholy
of all the burial-grounds of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.  Many a body
brought here to the grave has been the cause of other
deaths. The mourners at one funeral have been the
mourned at another. It would be impossible to enumerate the names of all the memorable dead who sleep
in this heavy clay; but here are Sydney Smith and
Thackeray, Mulready and John Leech, cardinal Wiseman and the duke of Sussex. Two other names only
will I mention. Who that has read the 'Tales of a
Grandfather' can forget <quote>Hugh Littlejohn, Esq.,</quote> to
whom they are dedicated ? Who that has felt himself
no nearer to heaven <quote>than when he was a boy</quote> can

<p>  The West Bourne, or as we sometimes find it written
Wesborn, divided the manor from that of <placeName key="Paddington">Paddington</placeName>,
both lying originally, as we have seen, in the same
parish. The extension of building over the western
manor has only taken place within living memory,
although an old village or two stood on the slope
between the brook and the boundary of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>
parish, near the top of the hill. Westbourne Green is
now wholly obliterated by railways, the great Paddington
station, properly in Westbourne, and the numberless
lines running into it or from it, to the city and to

Addison Road, meeting on the very spot which was so
long the village common. At the beginning of the
present century, and long after, it was remarkable for its
rural appearance. Westbourne Farm was the country
residence of Mrs. Siddons, and Westbourne Place was a
villa built for a city merchant by Isaac Ware, of whom
a contemporary declares that though originally only a
sweep, he was a born architect. Be this as it may, both
villa and farm have long been destroyed, and Westbourne Green is consumpta per ferro, razed literally with
the level ground, and covered with hundreds of lines of
iron railway. Westbourne Green Lane survives, but is
now known as Queen's Road, Bayswater. A few trees
and a nursery garden or two remain, but all the rest is
railway station, shops, and taverns.  To judge from
the changes the lane has undergone in a few years, it
will soon form a line of street as continuous and unbroken as Edgware Road, or Westbourne Grove itself.
The whole district has grown up in a short time round
one or two older centres, such as Orme Square, built in
<date value="1815">1815</date>, or the original Bayswater, a hamlet near what is
now Gloucester Terrace.  The site of St. Stephen's
church was, till <date value="1842">1842</date>, a racing ground, known as the
Hippodrome; and Christ Church, Lancaster Gate,
stands as nearly as possible where the old ponds of
Baynard's Watering became successively Bear's Watering, Bayswater, and Hopwood's nursery. A little further
west was the villa of lord Craven, inaccurately described
as  <quote>at the Gravel Pits,</quote> which has given its name to a
round dozen of modern streets, squares, gardens, places,
and terraces. The ground is marked in old maps as the
<soCalled>Pest Field.</soCalled> The good earl of Craven, in the time of
the Great Plague, had given a site in Soho both for a
burial ground and for a kind of cottage hospital, as we






                         <pb n="243" id="p.243"/>

 should call it, for the use of the suburbs. The pest field
 was situated between Golden Square and the <soCalled>Tyburn
 Road,</soCalled> now Oxford Street; but some time about the
 beginning of the last century it was decided to close the
 burial ground and build over the whole area. The then
 remote and desolate Upton Farm, <quote>near the Kensington
 Gravel Pits,</quote> was accordingly purchased for the representative of lord Craven, in lieu of any rights or contingent rights he might have over the Pest Field; but
 according to the terms of the exchange, the new Pest
 Field, previously Upton Farm, was, in case of plague, to
 be given up for the burial of victims from the parish of
 St. Anne. In some old maps Pest Field stands on the
 Bayswater Road, a little to the west of the old Bayswater Conduit.</p>
<p> When the princess Anne gave birth to the little son
 whose story has been so quaintly told by Jenkin Lewis,
 his servant,<note place="foot" n="\i">Reprint, <date value="1881">1881</date> (Stanford), p. 36.</note> <quote>her Highness sought after a house near
 town fit for his nursery; and, pitching upon <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>
 as a place of good air, she chose my lord Craven's house,
 at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> gravel pits, which his lordship readily
 lent her for that purpose. The young prince continued
 there about twelve months, thriving apace; and went
 out every day when dry, in the afternoon, in his little
 coach which the duchess of Ormond presented him
 with, and often times in the forenoon; nor was the
 severity of the winter's cold a pretence for his staying
 within. The horses, which were no larger than a good
 mastiff, were under the guidance of Dick Drury, his
 coachman.</quote> Lord Craven's house proving too small for

us of the stout old earl. He had fought for the daughter
of James; he had seen one king beheaded and another
exiled; he had lost an estate under the commonwealth,
and gained an earldom at the Restoration; he was universally believed to have married the widowed queen of
Bohemia, and to have comforted her declining years in
a princely retirement at Hampton in Berkshire, while
the mention of the Pest Field reminds us that he, with
the duke of Albemarle, remained in town during the
Great Plague of <date value="1665">1665</date>, succouring and directing when
every one else had fled or become crazy with fear. And
now in his old age we see him stooping over the cradle of
the poor decrepit child in whom the hopes of the nation
and the dynasty were so fallaciously centered. When
the little prince died, in <date value="1700">1700</date>, the good earl had already
gone to his well-earned repose; but if he had lived three
years longer he would have seen the succession to the
English throne settled on the daughter of the beloved
queen, whose widower he remained for six and thirty
years.</p>
<p>  The name of <soCalled>Dick Drury,</soCalled> the prince's coachman,
may point to the earl's connection with Drury Lane, or
may be accidental; but his liberality in offering his
house rent free to the princess, whom, in truth, he may
have looked on as a niece, was not imitated by the
owner of Campden House, to which the child was
removed in <date value="1691">1691</date>.</p>
<p>  From Craven Hill and its gardens to Orme Square
the ground rises gradually, so that when the border of
the parish of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> is reached, we are ninety-five
feet above the mean sea level. Naturally, this slope
facing Kensington Gardens is looked upon as one of the
best situations for fine houses, and is accordingly by
degrees assuming an appearance to be compared only






                                 <pb n="245" id="p.245"/>

 with that of Park Lane. But many small houses, shops
 two storey villas, and taverns still remain; and it is a
 question how far really substantial buildings can be
 erected unless upon longer leases than are at present
 granted by the dean and chapter.</p>
<p>   Bark Place, like Orme Square, takes its name from
 an old lessee, while Petersburgh Place and Moscow
 Road are said to commemorate the visit of the czar
 after the conclusion of peace in <date value="1815">1815</date>, when this district
 was first covered with houses.</p>
<p>   High as is the ground of Orme Square, it is over-
 topped by the neighbouring hill on whose north side is
 Notting Hill Gate, and at whose southern foot is the
 ancient village of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>.<note place="foot" n="\i">The meaning and derivation of "Kensington" are not easily discovered. It is usual to speak as if Kensing was a corruption of Cyning,
and as if <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> means King's Town. But the Chenesit of Domesday
is against this interpretation; and there is no parallel, so far as I know, for
turning Cyning into Kensing. On the whole I am inclined to see in
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> the name of a mark, and there are Kemsings in other places,
which afford a better derivation than can be made from Cyning.
</note></p>
<p>   It is customary to speak of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> as <soCalled>the old
court suburb,</soCalled> and if the name is correctly derived from
the Anglo-Saxon Conning, or Cyning, there may be
good ground for connecting it with royalty. But so far
back as direct history goes, <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> has had nothing
to do with kings and queens. Swift talks of <quote>kingly
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName></quote>; and other writers innumerable have followed him. In the Domesday Book, however, we find
no mention of kings among the owners, except when we
are told that Edwin, a vassal of king Edward the Confessor, owned the manor and could sell it, showing that it
was his absolute freehold.   At the time of the survey
it was held by Aubrey de Ver, not of the king, but of
the bishop of Coutances. It would thus appear that this






<pb n="246" id="p.246"/>

manor was singularly independent of royalty at the
earliest<note place="foot" n="1*">There is a Chenestun in a charter (Kemble, 992) of the reign of
Caedwalla of Wessex, but it has not been identified.</note>  period at which we have any mention of it;
and it may be added that <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> has maintained to
the present day its ancient condition in this respect.</p>
<p>  Aubrey "de Ver," as he is called in the Domesday
Book, became the ancestor of the Veres, earls of Oxford,
and the manor of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> remained theirs for many
generations, although Edward IV. gave it to his brother
Richard, and it was held for a time by Sir Reginald
Bray. But a very large slice of the manor was granted
about <date value="1107">1107</date> to the abbot of Abingdon, near Oxford,
by the first Aubrey, <quote>for the soul's health</quote> of his
eldest son, and as the church was included in the gift,
and actually stands on this part of the land, the parish
obtained the name it has ever since borne of St. Mary
Abbot's.<note place="foot" n="\i">Oddly enough, one of the most voluminous and ambitious of modern
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> historians devotes three long chapters to Kensington without a
mention of the abbot of Abingdon.
</note> The Abingdon estate became itself a submanor, and perhaps the manor house, now known as
Holland House, is the most celebrated building in
Kensington. The earl's manor house was, as the name
imports, in Earl's Court Road, and we shall probably
not go far wrong if we identify it with the house long
occupied by the great John Hunter, and lately standing
near Earl's Court Station.</p>
<p>  Of the other, or Holland House, we have heard almost
too much of late years. To believe Macaulay no house
ever contained within its walls so many eminent men at
the same time. Certainly, one of the most influential of
the many mutual-admiration societies, which are to be
found mentioned in English history, occasionally met in



                         <pb n="247" id="p.247"/>

its dining-room. But though Wilkie may here have gazed
at a picture by Reynolds, and Mackintosh have <quote>turned
over Thomas Aquinas,</quote> and Talleyrand have related an
adventure with Lannes,<note place="foot" n="\i">'Macaulay's Essays,' ii. 180.</note> there have been greater men
assembled together under one roof than Wilkie, Mackintosh, and Talleyrand, even if we throw in Macaulay,
with Marshall Lannes, Reynolds, and the saint. Many
of us, looking back through a longer perspective, may
think some of the club meetings in Soho, such as that
lashed by Goldsmith in his " Retaliation," would bear
comparison with the best party ever assembled at
Holland House, though among them were several
eminent Whigs, together with Sydney Smith, Byron,
<persName key="More, Thomas">Thomas Moore</persName>, and Thomas Campbell. Lady Holland
appears to have been a very disagreeable person, of
character so questionable that ladies could not appear
at her table; and though she was the great and typical
<soCalled>Mrs. Leo Hunter</soCalled> of her day-hospitable, clever, and
managing-it is impossible to admire her.</p>
<p>  There are fortunately older and better memories about
Holland House. The third lord Holland, Macaulay's
contemporary, was the son of Stephen, second lord, who
died early, and nephew of Charles James Fox. When
Fox was young, his lovely aunt, lady Sarah Lennox,
here received her many admirers, made hay upon the
lawn, petted her squirrel, grieved over the birds her
nephew killed,<note place="foot" n="\i">According to the picture by Reynolds.</note> nearly broke a king's heart, and cried
for the loss of a crown as if it had been a plaything. It
would be easy to linger over this charming figure.<note place="foot" n="\i">There is a chapter on lady Sarah in my 'In and Out of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.'</note> </p>
<p>  Casting our eyes a little further back still we come to
another remarkable name. Before the time of Henry




<pb n="248" id="p.248"/>

Fox, the first baron, who having bought the house took
his title from it, the family of Rich, earls of Warwick
and Holland, had owned it. The last earl but two left
a widow, Charlotte, the daughter of a Welsh baronet.
In <date value="1716">1716</date> she married Joseph Addison, and in Holland
House, three years later, the Spectator looked his last on
the world. Here he is said to have shown his stepson
how a Christian can die, and we may hope the young
earl took advantage of the example, for he only outlived
Addison a couple of years.</p>
<p>  The Rich family boasted of a martyr in the royal
cause.  The earl of Holland obtained the house by
a fortunate marriage and had been concerned with
"Steenie" in the Spanish project. He had first defied
Charles, who imprisoned him, and afterwards Cromwell
by whose orders he was beheaded. He took his minor
title from Kensington, and his earldom from the  <quote>parts of
Holland,</quote> in Lincolnshire. He died before Westminster
Hall in a satin doublet and silver lace, at the very place
where thirty years before Raleigh had met the same
fate. He enjoyed good company to the last, for the duke
of Hamilton preceded him to the block, and lord Capel
followed him. He was the least worthy of the three,
and his family do not seem to have mourned for him
long, for we find Holland House mentioned soon after
as one of the places in which private theatricals were
performed during the mirthless days of the protectorate.</p>
<p>  Sir Walter Cope had obtained from James I. all the
abbot's manor, and there is every reason to suppose that
he built his new house on the old site. On the other
hand, while manorial customs prevailed, it was to a
house near the present vicarage that the inhabitants of
St. Mary Abbot's resorted to do suit and service; and
it is not impossible that the abbot of Abingdon did not






                          <pb n="249" id="p.249"/>

live very far from the church. Be this as it may, Sir
Walter spared neither money nor good taste, and the
result is a house of which it can only be said that it is
among the most picturesque of <placeName key="London">London</placeName> suburban
dwellings. It is said that Thorpe was the architect, but
Inigo Jones and Nicholas Stone also left their mark on
it, and though there have been modern alterations, even to
the extent of changing the face of the house, it remains
substantially as it was in the reign of the first Stuart.</p>
<p>  Among Sir Walter Cope's associates was a rich city
merchant, of obscure birth, named  Hicks.  To this
worthy, so runs the tale, Sir Walter lost at the gaming
table a few acres of the hill which rose between his own
house and the church. Sir <persName key="Hicks, Baptist">Baptist Hicks</persName> took advantage
of the site to erect a villa by no means unworthy of its
great neighbour, and planting an avenue of elms from
his hall-door to the village High Street, finished it with
a pair of brick gate-posts, surmounted by the hounds
which on his elevation to a peerage formed his supporters.
Like Sir Walter Sir Baptist had no son, and Campden
House, as he named it, went to his elder daughter, on
whose husband, Edward Noel, the title was entailed,
together with the manor of Chipping Campden, in
Gloucestershire, from which it was derived.</p>
<p>  The Noels lived at Campden House after the death of
Sir Baptist in <date value="1629">1629</date>. His will contains so many charitable
bequests that Stow's continuator devotes a whole chapter
to it, and to <quote>an epitaph made in his Memoriall,</quote> which
commences with
<quote rend="blockquote">                  Faith true

inferred. His bequest to Kensington consisted of a sum
of 200&#x00A3;.  <quote>to be yearly employed for the good and benefit
of the poor.</quote> This legacy was invested in the purchase
of <quote>two closes, containing fourteen acres, called Chare
Crofts, situated near Sheppard's Bush Green, in the
parish of Fulham.</quote> Chare Crofts bring in now 480&#x00A3;. a
year, and the trustees have some 10,000&#x00A3;. in consols.
Lady Campden, the widow of the second viscount, also
left a legacy to the parish, with which the authorities
bought, in <date value="1644">1644</date>, <quote>a close, called Butt's Field, containing
5 acres, 2 roods, and 30 perches, and also 3 roods to be
taken out of Middle Quayle Field.</quote><note place="foot" n="\i">Report of the Vestry, 181O, p. 41.</note> These lands
adjoined Hogmore, or Hogmire Lane, now Gloucester
Road and Palace Gate, and bring in some 360&#x00A3;., while
about 40,000&#x00A3;. have accumulated.</p>
<p>  The Noels became extinct, in the male line, early in
the eighteenth century, but the trustee of the last of them,
a Mr. Bertie, is said to have asked the princess Anne
such a rent for Campden House <quote>that it was imagined
any other person might have purchased it for less.</quote><note place="foot" n="\i">Lewis, p. 36 (reprint).</note>
Yet the house was too small for the princess and her
son, and a building now known as Little Campden
House was added on the western side.</p>
<p>  The poor little prince is carefully described by his
faithful servant; even his height and weight and the size
of his head are recorded. We read of his medicines, his
blisters, his very mild birchings, his new clothes and stiff
waistcoat, his tumbles, and his refusal to say his prayers.
William III. appears in a new and amiable light, caressing
his little nephew. He named him duke of Gloucester,
a title never formally used, and when he was six
years of age, <quote>as a Garter was vacant by the death of
Lord Stafford, the King came to Campden House and






                            <pb n="251" id="p.251"/>

told the princess she should have St. James's Palace to
reside in, and that he would bestow the Order of the
Garter on the Duke: he also informed her Highness
why he had not done it before. Accordingly on the
4th of January, <date value="1696">1696</date>, the Bishop of Salisbury came to
tell the Duke that he should have the Garter within two
days; and asked him if the thoughts of it did not make
him glad ? 'I am gladder of the King's favour to me,'
he said without being prompted to it.</quote><note place="foot" n="\i">Lewis, p. 97.</note></p>
<p>  The child was devoted to military pursuits. Every one
has heard of his boy regiment. His attendants made
him fortifications in the grounds of Campden House, and
when the king visited him he fired a salute from real
guns with real powder. His boy regiment was partly recruited from <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> was not yet perhaps
sufficiently populous to furnish more than a couple of
score or so. They assembled on holidays and were put
through their exercises by the little duke, who enforced
strict discipline and administered the military punishments in vogue at that date. Yet we hear of complaints
of their insolence when dismissed from parade. When
they were coming from <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, or going home, they
were often very rude and would <quote>fall on many people.</quote>
It was a proud day for the little duke when William
came to review them. <quote>My dear King,</quote> he exclaimed,
<quote>you shall have both my companies with you to
Flanders.</quote></p>
<p>   The duke died in <date value="1700">1700</date> at Windsor, and Campden
 House was next occupied by the dowager countess of
 Burlington<note place="foot" n="\i">She was the daughter of Henry Noel, second son of the third Viscount
 Campden, and widow of Charles Boyle, Earl of Burlington, who died in

 "Architect Earl." He may have imbibed some of his



<pb n="252" id="p.252"/>

architectural taste from contemplating the beauties of
the old house, with its mullioned windows richly dight in
stained glass, and its magnificent oak carvings.</p>
<p>   In <date value="1719">1719</date> it was sold to Nicholas Lechmere, who became a peer in <date value="1721">1721</date>, and died childless in <date value="1727">1727</date>, being
 now chiefly remembered for a lampoon of Swift's<note place="foot" n="\i">"Duke upon Duke."</note>
 which he provoked. The house went into Chancery and
 appears to have been unoccupied till <date value="1735">1735</date>, when it was
 decreed by the Court to Edmund Lechmere, M.P. for
 Worcestershire. He did not keep it long; and the next
 owner, Stephen Pitt, a relation in all probability of the
 Chatham family,<note place="foot" n="\i">Anne Pitt died at her house in Pitt Place, Kensington Gravel Pits, in

 let the older building to some ladies who kept an
  <quote>eminent boarding school for young ladies.</quote></p>
<p>   Pitt married the daughter and heiress of a man
named Orbell who would probably be forgotten by
posterity but for the fact that the great Sir Isaac
Newton used to come to <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> for change of air,
and died at last in Orbell's Buildings in <date value="1727">1727</date>. Orbell's
Buildings are now called Bullingham House, and a
tablet let into the wall records Newton's name.<note place="foot" n="\i">Some confusion as to the exact place of Newton's death was resolved
by a letter from Mr. Jopling in ' Notes and Queries,' 3rd Series, i. 29.</note> The
Bullinghams were an old <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> family, one of
whom was bishop of Gloucester in the reign of queen
Elizabeth, and was buried in the old church. When
Orbell died in <date value="1734">1734</date>, Pitt inherited or already possessed
a considerable estate on the hill, and to him we may
attribute many alterations, such as the shortening of the
old avenue, the removal of "The Dogs," and perhaps
the building of a mock ruin at the corner of the wall
next Sheffield Terrace. When the underground railway

was made, a tunnel ran through the garden, which is not
however, apparently much injured by it. In <date value="1862">1862</date>, being
at the time in the occupation of a Mr. Woolley, the
house was completely gutted by fire,<note place="foot" n="\i">There is some account of this fire in the amusing memoirs of Serjeant
Ballantine, i. 270.
</note> but rebuilt immediately.   It now belongs to Mr. Elder, by whom the
grounds are well kept up, and materially help Campden
Hill to retain its ancient look of umbrageous verdure.
In the east wall is the old gateway, now built up, which
opened towards Kensington Palace, when William III.
lived there, and when there was nothing but a gardener's
cottage between the two houses. The wall now faces
Sheffield Gardens, which with other local names reminds
us of the existence of a villa on this hill belonging to
lord Sheffield, the friend of Gibbon.</p>
<p>  The Pratts, from whom the marquis Camden is descended, were an old <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> family. The great
Chancellor may have had Campden Hill, or as it was
then usually spelled Camden Hill, in his mind, when he
chose that name for his peerage, though it is always attributed to his veneration for Camden, the antiquary,
whose house at Chislehurst he had bought.<note place="foot" n="\i">In my edition of Jenkyn Lewis there is mention of a Mr. Prat, who
was tutor to the duke of Gloucester (p. 9), and I have endeavoured to
connect him with the Pratts of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>.  I have since discovered,
through the kindness of Mrs. Wilkinson, a descendant of his, that I was
mistaken. Samuel Prat, in whom I have another cause for interest
because he was chaplain of the Savoy, always spelled the name with one
T, as did his descendants to the present day. He is buried in St. George's
Chapel at Windsor. He was created D.D. at Cambridge, by the king's
desire, in <date value="1697">1697</date>. He wrote a Latin Grammar and published some sermons.

Twickenham, chaplain of the Savoy, canon of Windsor, and in <date value="1697">1697</date>, dean
of Rochester. A memorial ring for the little duke and a prayer book
which belonged to queen Anne are still in possession of the Prat family.</note> </p>

<p>  The north-western and south-eastern extremities of
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> have so little to do with the central
village that it is sometimes difficult to remember that
Notting Hill and Brompton are equally within the old
parochial boundary; though the palace is within that of
St. Margaret, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. The Notting Hill extremity
presents few features of interest. It is for the most part
cut up into small holdings, some free, some leased.
Ladbroke Grove commemorates its builder, and Ladbroke Square has somewhat absurdly been renamed
Kensington Park. St. John's Church stands on the site
of the Notting Hill farmhouse, described by Faulkner
in <date value="1820">1820</date> as an ancient brick building, surrounded by
spacious barns. This church, which is in a poor style of
gothic, was for a brief period the incumbency of the
lamented Craufurd Tait, only son of the late archbishop
of Canterbury.</p>
<p>  The summit of Campden Hill is very conspicuous
from St. John's Church, as it rises 120 feet above the
sea-level and is crowned with a chimney 200 feet high,
belonging to the Grand Junction Water Works. Close
to the chimney is a cluster of villas, including a ridiculous
plastered tower in <soCalled>the Norman style,</soCalled> and some plain
old-fashioned houses locally known as the Dukeries. In
one of them, Holly Lodge, lord Macaulay died in <date value="1859">1859</date>.</p>
<p>  In Church Street, and also in Lower Phillimore Place
(called after its builder, who died in <date value="1819">1819</date>), Sir David
Wilkie long resided. John Leech died in a house on
what is called The Terrace. In fact, to attempt any
enumeration of the eminent inhabitants would be absurd.
As we pass towards Brompton, however, two at least
should be noticed. If we turn out of High Street by
Young Street (called also after one Young, who built it),
we reach Kensington Square. The last house but one
in the street, now unfortunately and purposelessly renumbered,






                          <pb n="255" id="p.255"/>

 on the right hand, was long the residence of
 Thackeray, whose later years were passed in a new
 house within the avenue of Palace Gardens.   The
 square was built as a speculation when king William
 first came to reside at the palace, and contains still some
 charming little <soCalled>bits</soCalled> of the Wren period, one of the
 best being a now divided tenement at the south-eastern
 corner. Through a narrow lane leading from this corner
 we reach a labyrinth of small streets, some of them old,
 some new, and crossing it as best we can emerge in
 Cornwall Gardens. Here, covering the ground now
 occupied by the gardens, and by Gloucester Road
 Station, was Glo'ster or Onslow Villa, in which lived
 George Canning, and here his son, the future governor-
 general, was born, and another son, who lies buried in
 Kensington Churchyard with a touching epitaph by the
 great statesman.</p>
 <p>We thus reach Brompton, famous once upon a time
 for its gardens, but now covered with a new quarter of
 fashionable houses, even its own name being suppressed
 as vulgar and <soCalled>South Kensington</soCalled> substituted. It is
 not necessary here to describe the ever-changing glories
 of the famous local institutions, the three museums, the
 portrait gallery, and the Hall of Science and Art, all of
 which, as some believe, might better have been placed
 where they would be accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>It will be sufficient to say that the science and art
 museum is under the control of the Education Department, and, since its establishment, in <date value="1857">1857</date>, has proved a
 serious rival to both the British Museum and the National
 Gallery. It is understood that the unseemly spectacle
 of rival public galleries bidding each other up in an art
 sale is not to be witnessed again, but it is unquestionable
that the early managers of the institution did much not
only to bring it into disfavour with many people, but, by






<pb n="256" id="p.256"/>

the way in which they sheltered themselves behind the
lamented Prince Consort, added greatly to the unpopularity of his efforts to further culture in this country.
Meanwhile a new town has grown up round the Albert
Hall and the South Kensington Museum. They are still
inaccessible to a large number of the class for whose
benefit they were opened, but on the whole it must be
conceded that, in general arrangements, in careful cataloguing, in the provision of comfortable reading and
refreshment rooms, and many other particulars, they set
a good example to older museums.</p>
<p>   Two houses designed by Mr. Norman Shaw, and so
 contrived, unfortunately, that like two negatives they
 destroy one another, are at the corner of Exhibition
 Road, facing the park. In old times this corner was
 Kensington Gore, and very lately the remains of lady
 Blessington's house were still to be seen. Here Wilberforce resided for many years, and here, if I mistake not,
 his son the bishop of Oxford was born.
 There is something more than tradition to connect the
 name of Cromwell with <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, but only tradition
 to connect it with Brompton. It is true <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>
 was much affected by Cromwell's friends.  General
 Lambert is mentioned in the parish register as lord
 Lambert, and there is also the name of Sir William
 Strickland, another of Oliver's peers, and of Sir Thomas
 Foot, a third, as well as of Sir Edward Dering, the
 eccentric Kentish baronet, whose precise political position
 at any particular time it would be difficult to assign.
 The register contains one entry which refers directly to
 the family of the protector. In <date value="1653">1653</date> "<quote>Mr. Henry
 Cromwell</quote> was married to Elizabeth Russell. The
 entry proves nothing. It points to the probability that
the family of Elizabeth Russell lived in the parish. But





                              <pb n="257" id="p.257"/>

tradition will have it that he, and also that his father,
the great Oliver, lived in a house near what is now the
South Kensington Museum, and accordingly a street,
one of the longest and widest in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, Cromwell
Road, is called after them. In an enumeration of the
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> parochial charities<note place="foot" n="\i">'Vestry Report,' <date value="1810">1810</date>, p. 92.</note> is an account of a  <soCalled>deed

nor was it said how the 45&#x00A3;. was obtained, nor for what
purpose, but the land, on which are now some houses in
High Street, Notting Hill Gate, has long been called
Cromwell's Gift.</p>
<p>  This is not very clear or satisfactory evidence; nor
have we much more respecting another <soCalled>eminent

among <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> worthies. The fourth earl of Exeter,
<soCalled>John Cecill, son and heir apparent</soCalled> of John, lord
Burleigh, was born at Mr. Sheffield's, and baptised in
the parish church in <date value="1674">1674</date>. But the great lord Burleigh
is known to have lived at Brompton Hall, and his
house was still pointed out, but doubtfully, fifty years
ago. The Brompton part of the parish has, in fact,
been so long broken up into small holdings that a
mere enumeration of the successive owners of estates
would include some very remarkable names.<note place="foot" n="\i">For such an enumeration see Croker's 'Walk from <placeName key="London">London</placeName> to

<p>  Kensington Church, as I remember it in my boyhood,
was one of the few really picturesque buildings of the
kind near <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. It was, of course, by no means
worthy of a parish which can boast of such aristocratic
residents and neighbours as the <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> of to-day,
but it harmonised well with what is left of old Kensington Square; and the cupola on the palace, and
the old vestry-hall and its blue-coat children, now
sent in disgrace to the back entrance; and with Colby
House, and Kensington House, formerly known as Little
Bedlam. Almost all these relics have disappeared. One
of the most hideous buildings in Europe occupies the
site of Colby House. No lunatic in the old house could
have imagined, in his wildest dreams, the pretentious
ugliness of the mansion fitly called <soCalled>Grant's Folly.</soCalled><note place="foot" n="\i">Kensington House is said, truly or falsely, to have been erected for a
Mr. Grant, a <placeName key="London">London</placeName> merchant, who, however, has not that I am aware
ever resided in it.
</note>
It is now being pulled down, but that will not replace
Colby House and its companion. The town hall is
new and commonplace, the officials having unfortunately
refused a <soCalled>Queen Anne</soCalled> design for it.    The old
church, with its quaint curved gable to the street corner,
and its well weathered red brick, has also disappeared.
Why the parish authorities did not follow the good
example of St. Marylebone, and build their new church
on a new site, say at the top of the hill, the finest
situation in the world for such a building, and now
occupied by the little tower and spire of St. George's, I
cannot but wonder. However, all is gone, the reading
desk and pulpit, with the initials of William and Mary,
and the royal pew with its curtain, and the seat occupied
by Macaulay, and the rails where the duchess of Kent
was churched after the birth of queen Victoria.</p>





                           <pb n="259" id="p.259"/>

<p>  The new church is very handsome, and boasts of the
highest spire in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>; indeed, it is said, the highest
pointed spire on any parish church in England. Including the metal cross on the top it is within an inch or
two of measuring 300 feet, and is not only a very conspicuous but a very pleasing object when seen from
Kensington Gardens, reflected, perhaps, in the Round
Pond, and with the glow of a sunset behind it. Sir
Gilbert Scott who designed the church did not live to
see the spire completed.</p>
<p>  There are many churches in different parts of the
parish. Holy Trinity, Brompton, has long been reckoned
a parish church. It was designed <quote>in a neat gothic
style,</quote> and built in <date value="1829">1829</date>. Close to it, overshadowing it,
in fact, is the rising dome of a new church for the
Oratorians of St. Philip Neri, of which the Oratory at
Birmingham, over which cardinal Newman has so long
presided, is the head.  Faber, the hymn writer, was
before his death the superior of the Brompton establishment. The new church will be a very prominent example
of the Italian style when it is completed. The Roman
Catholics have many other churches in <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, the
largest being the so-called Pro-Cathedral in a court off
High Street. It is too short for its great height, owing
to its lofty clerestory, and is very conspicuous from the
exterior; but the interior is unsatisfactory. The late
Dr. Rock was priest of this church, and is remembered
with regret by all who knew him, and especially by
those who had occasion to test his unrivalled knowledge
of some of the more obscure departments of medieval
art.</p>
<p>  Divided from southern <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, or Brompton, only
by the width of the Fulham Road, and bounded on the
other side by the course of the Thames, <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> has







<pb n="260" id="p.260"/>

long been a very urban suburb. The manor is called
Chelched in "Domesday," with an alternative reading,
Cercehede. It belonged to Edward de Sarisberie, and
before the Conquest to Wlwene, <quote>a vassal of king
Edward,</quote> who <quote>could sell it to whom he pleased.</quote>
The further descent of the manor is involved in obscurity
for some centuries, but, in <date value="1368">1368</date>, Robert de Heyle leased
it to the abbey of Westminster for his own life. In
the reign of Henry VII. it belonged to the great Sir
Reginald Bray, the architect of St. George's Chapel at
Windsor.  His niece, lady Sandys, inherited it; but
had to exchange it for other lands with Henry VIII.
The king settled it on Katherine Parr, his sixth wife.
She was succeeded by her sister-in-law, the widow of
the protector Somerset, who was a Stanhope; and
through her mother, a Bourchier, descended from
Thomas of Woodstock, one of the sons of Edward III.
On her children, to the prejudice of her stepson, Sir
<persName key="Seymour, Edward">Edward Seymour</persName>, the dukedom of Somerset was settled
when the protector conferred that honour upon himself
in <date value="1547">1547</date>. It thus came to pass that a later Sir <persName key="Seymour, Edward">Edward
Seymour</persName> could tell William of Orange that the duke of
Somerset belonged to his family, when the prince, at his
landing, had asked him if he belonged to the duke's family.</p>
<p>  The manor was also held by a relative of the duchess,
the first lord Stanhope of Harrington, and by Katharine,
lady Howard; but in the time of Charles I. it had
reverted to the Crown, and was granted to that duke
of Hamilton, or Duke Hamilton, as his contemporaries
called him, whom we have already seen accompanying
the lord of the adjoining manor of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> to the
scaffold at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. In the Hamilton family the
manor remained for a time, till it was bought by lord
Newhaven, whose surname survives in Cheyne Walk and

<p>  In  <date value="1712">1712</date>  Sir Hans    Sloane bought the manor of
<placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> from the Cheyne family; and his daughter
and coheiress, Elizabeth, married the famous general
Cadogan, a colonel of horse guards in Marlborough's
wars, whose descendant, earl Cadogan, is now lord of
the manor and viscount "Chelsey." Sir Hans is commemorated in Hans Place and Sloane Square; the
Cadogans in Cadogan Place and Cadogan Square; and
the Lawrences, who lived in the old manor house, by
grant from Henry VIII., in Lawrence Street, near the
old church.</p>
<p>  Such is the written history of the manor. It would

place could have been found for Sir <persName key="More, Thomas">Thomas More</persName>'s
residence. It was, no doubt, when visiting More at
<placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> that Henry VIII. cast his covetous eyes on the
manor. He gave the old manor house to the Lawrences,
as I have said, and built another close to the water's
edge.<note place="foot" n="\i">Anne of Cleves died in <date value="1557">1557</date>, at the <quote>King and Queen's majesty's

was More's house.
</note> Adjoining it was long a residence of the bishop

by Sir John Danvers in the reign of Charles I., and was
wholly removed in <date value="1696">1696</date>, when Danvers Street was built
on the site. Beaufort Street commemorates Beaufort

the Cremorne Gardens, so long a nuisance to the

residence of an old viscountess Cremorne for many
years; Lindsey House was the villa of the Berties,
earls of Lindsey, and has given place to streets called
after them; and, in short, it may be said of <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>
in the seventeenth century, that it was to the <placeName key="London">London</placeName>
of that day what the Strand had been in the reign of
Richard II.</p>
<p>  All the figures which pass and repass along the bank
of the river at <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> are less distinct and less interesting than that of Sir <persName key="More, Thomas">Thomas More</persName>. Had his jealous
master but allowed him, he might here have ended his
days in peace. We see him one day walking in his
garden with Erasmus, or sitting to Holbein, another
bearing the heavy honour of Henry's arm about his
neck. On Sunday he goes into the choir and sings in a
surplice, <quote>like a parish clerk,</quote> as the duke of Norfolk
observed contemptuously. When he has resigned his

office, it is his wife that suffers, as so often in such
cases,<note place="foot" n="\i">One is tempted to refer to Sir Cloudesly Shovel's proposal that the
king should knight his wife.</note> and the attendant no longer goes to her pew to
announce the departure of " My Lord." In everything he
is simple and unaffected to the verge of affectation, but
when we come to read an anecdote of More, which we
do not chance to know already, we somehow always feel
sure, however he may approach that boundary, he will
never pass it. His charities are described as being cut
after the plainest gospel pattern. He seldom feasted the
rich, but his poor neighbours often; and when he was a
practising lawyer, <quote>he took no fees of poor folks, widows,
or pupils.</quote></p>
<p>  In the old parish church, near the river, More's monument
still stands. The church is an interesting building
of the most mixed character; so far, happily, not very
much hurt by restorers.    More made a chapel for his
family tomb at the east end of the south aisle, and put
up a black slab to record the fact. It has been twice
<soCalled>improved</soCalled>, and is said to have originally contained a
reference to his persecution of heresy, for which a blank
is now left in the renewed inscription, just the kind of
evasion one can imagine the straightforward chancellor
would himself have particularly disliked.<note place="foot" n="\i">Was it in anticipation of his own fate that More concluded his wife's
epitaph with these lines ?

There are several members of his family buried at
<placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, including both his wives. Some of the other
monuments are curious. One of them commemorates
Jane, duchess of Northumberland, widow of the protector, mother of queen Elizabeth's favourite, Leicester,

that of her daughter, lady Huntingdon, and there are
many tablets to the Lawrences, Cheynes, and other

Spragge, who having fought the Dutch in boy's clothes
on board the ship of her brother, Captain Chamberlayne,
died in child-bed, in <date value="1692">1692</date>. The epitaph laments that
she should have failed to become the mother of a line of
heroes. Sir <persName key="Sloane, Hans">Hans Sloane</persName> and Magdalen Herbert, mother
of George Herbert, the poet, are buried in the churchyard.</p>
<p>  The newer church of St. Luke stands much further
inland, and is in the style of gothic that might be
expected from its date. It was consecrated in <date value="1824">1824</date>.</p>
<p>  Chelsea Hospital for old and disabled soldiers has
always been a very popular institution, especially with
artists. Wilkie painted the <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> pensioners exulting
over the news of Waterloo, for the duke of Wellington,
and in our own day a picture of the veterans in chapel
engaged the attention of the crowd at Burlington House.
It owes its foundation to Charles II., who, at the instigation, it was supposed, of Eleanor Gwynn, authorised for
the purpose the purchase, from the Royal Society, of
the site of a theological college, founded under the half-hearted




                          <pb n="265" id="p.265"/>

patronage of James I., by dean Sutcliffe, of
Exeter. Laud's influence was all against the college, as
stirring up controversy with the Roman Catholics. The
story of the college buildings, their presentation to the
Royal Society, their resumption, after payment, by the
crown, and, finally, the slow progress of the hospital are
detailed by Evelyn. Sir <persName key="Wren, Christopher">Christopher Wren</persName> was the
architect, but, though the cost is believed to have
amounted to 150,000&#x00A3;., and though the buildings were
not finished till <date value="1690">1690</date>, there are none of the magnificent
features of the same architect's sister hospital at Greenwich. Yet Chelsea Hospital is, like all Sir Christopher's
work, full of the beauty which proportion and fitness can
give a plain design.</p>

<p>THE manors and estates which form the southern
suburbs have, with one exception, very little of the
historical interest which still hangs round Marylebone
and Tyburn, <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> and <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>. They lie for the
most part on land which has always been suited for
villa building. Had it not been for a peculiarity of the
position opposite <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, even suburbs would hardly
have been made on ground which can only be called
dry because the incursions of flood tides are kept out by
artificial means, if they are kept out at all. As we had
occasion to see in going over the geographical aspect of
the so-called <soCalled>Metropolitan Area,</soCalled><note place="foot" n="1">See chap. i. vol. i.</note> the ground opposite
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> and <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> is a kind of peninsula, half
surrounded by the river. Before reaching <placeName key="London">London</placeName> the
Thames makes a great bend to the north at <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>
Reach.  It bends again, this time to the south, after
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> is passed, at Limehouse Reach. The space
thus inclosed, some four miles in width from Lambeth
to Greenwich, is bounded on the south by low hills, of
which the best known is crowned by the Crystal Palace.
The peninsula bears evident traces of having but recently
emerged, and we have a kind of historical evidence as to
part of it, as "royal foreshore," and a more tangible
proof in the frequent floods which alarm the inhabitants.
In short, we are constantly reminded, as well by local







                        <pb n="267" id="p.267"/>

names, such as Lambeth Marsh and Newington Causeway, as by such outbursts of the tide as that of <date value="1850">1850</date>,
that the greater part of the district is only a few feet
above, and a considerable part of it is actually below
high water mark.</p>
<p>   But if we look for a moment at a map we shall see
that Southwark forms, as it were, the handle of a fan,
with <placeName key="London">London</placeName> and its suburbs spreading all round it. We
also observe that the Thames, which is more than
<date value="1200">1200</date> feet wide at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, is only 900 feet between
the extreme north point of the peninsula and the opposite
shore at Billingsgate. Even before the bridge was built,
the spot at which it spans the river must have been of
importance, for it is nearer the city than any other point
on the southern or right bank for several miles above or
below.</p>
<p>  Confining our attention for the present to the outer
ring of the southern suburbs, we find early evidence as
to the lowness and dampness of the site of Lambeth,
Kennington, and Bermondsey. It will not do to press
too far the argument that Kennington was always the
king's property, because it was "foreshore," and was
occasionally submerged at high tides. But a considerable number of acres in the manor must have been under
water before the river bank was raised; and it is certain that kings did claim foreshore at a very early
period.</p>
<p>  There is also another point which, though like the
former one, it must not be pressed too far, is yet worth
mentioning. In the 'Domesday Survey' we read that
Kennington-there spelled Chenintun-was assessed in
the reign of the Confessor for five hides, but that it now
contains only a hide and three virgates; in other words,
the land of the manor was not more than a quarter after







<pb n="268" id="p.268"/>

the Conquest of what it had been in the peaceful times
of Edward. We find precisely the same state of things
in the adjoining manor of Lambeth, which had declined
from ten hides to two and a half. Even if we did not
know of the probability of a great irruption of the river
to cause this discrepancy, a flood of some kind would be
one of the most obvious explanations.</p>
<p>  If we suppose, therefore, that after long occupation
and cultivation by the hard-working churls of the little
"Suther Rige," or Southern      Kingdom, the land had
gradually been won for the king; that great embankments had been made, and annual labour bestowed to
keep them in repair; but that, under the oppressions of
the Normans the land was allowed again to fall a prey
to the restless tide, we may, it is more than probable,
have formed a good working theory for the early history
of the southern suburbs.</p>
<p>  Kennington and Lambeth are both in the same great
parish of St. Mary. It would almost seem, when we
remember all the St. Mary's we have enumerated on
the northern and western sides of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, as if it had
been determined to surround the city with a circle of
churches dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The name of
Lambeth-almost obviously Lamb-hithe-has given rise
to the most amazing guesses. In Domesday it is oddly
spelled Lanchei, probably by a mistake of the scribe.<note place="foot" n="2"> Allen, ' History of Lambeth,' <date value="1827">1827</date>, says of the name: " In the ancient
historians it is spelt Lamhee, Lamheth, Lambyth, Lamedh, and several
other variations, the principal of which were probably occasioned by the
errors of transcribers. Most etymologists derive the name from lam, dirt;
and hyd or hyde, a haven. Dr. Ducarel differs with this explanation of the
name, and considers that it is derived from lamb, a lamb; and hyd, a
haven; but that eminent antiquary, Dr. Gale, derives it from the circumstance of its contiguity to a Roman road, or leman, which is generally
supposed to have terminated at the river at Stangate, from whence was a
passage over the Thames."</note>









                         <pb n="269" id="p.269"/>

But in a charter of king Edward (1O62) it is Lambehith,<note place="foot" n="3">'Codex Diplom.' No. 813. One William Lamhith was clerk of the
works in the Tower in <date value="1360">1360</date>. See Britton and Brayley, 337, and 'Close
Rolls,' 34 Edw. III. m. 15.</note>
and the name seems very suitable in this form to the
circumstances of the situation, an embarking place for
agricultural produce, whence easy access could be
obtained by ferry to the more densely populated districts
of the left bank. King Edward's charter, which seems
to relate to a portion only of Lambeth-that now
known as Stockwell-and speaks of the fields, pastures,
meadows, woods, and waters belonging to it, grants them
all to the abbey of Waltham.</p>
<p>  This was but four years before the Conquest, and the
charter took effect under Harold, but Edward's sister,
" the Countess Goda," seems to have been in possession
of the original manor, and before her death she and her
husband, Eustace of Boulogne, joined to give it to the
bishop and monastery of Rochester. This gift seems to
have failed; but it is impossible to unravel the confusion
which exists between the different statements ancient and
modern, the more so as we can seldom feel quite sure
which manor is referred to, until William  Rufus,<note place="foot" n="4">We may dismiss altogether a notion supported by some writers that
Harold ever held Lambeth. Mr. Freeman has shown the improbability
of the story that he placed the crown on his own head at Lambeth. The
countess Goda held it till the Conquest, and gave it, perhaps ineffectually,
to Rochester. <persName key="Rufus, William">William Rufus</persName> makes a new grant, which is perhaps to be
taken as in reality a confirmation. His charter is in the British Museum.
It is signed with a cross, but is undated.</note>  by one
of the few acts of the kind recorded of him, gave Lambeth to the convent at Rochester, in avowed reparation
of the injuries he had done the church there in his siege
of the place. This gift may have been merely a confirmation of the previous gift of Goda; but from it as certain,
we may date the connection of Rochester and Lambeth.</p>







<pb n="270" id="p.270"/>

<p>  The first exercise of the new authority is characteristic
at once of the times and of the condition of the manor.
Bishop Gundulf ordered his vassals to supply him annually with <quote>half a thousand</quote>  of those lamprey-eels, to
which we have so many references in medieval history,
for the better exercise of episcopal hospitality. Ernulf,
the next bishop but one, added a salmon to the requirements of the monastery, for the anniversary of bishop
Gundulf. Ascelin claimed too much personal interest
in Lambeth, and the higher authorities determined that
the bishop had only his share of the manor with the
monks, although, when business required his attendance
in <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, he had a lodging assigned him in the manorhouse, with forage and fuel.</p>
<p>  The convenient situation of this manor-house at Lambeth with regard to the court at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> is thus
already indicated. Very soon the archbishop of Canterbury began to see that what was convenient for the
bishop of Rochester was convenient also for him. He
rented the house from the bishop, and at a synod here
in <date value="1100">1100</date> the lawfulness of the marriage of Henry II. with
Maud of Scotland was determined. A consecration took
place at Lambeth in <date value="1121">1121</date>, when archbishop Ralph was
assisted by five bishops, his own successor in the see of
Rochester, which he had held between <date value="1108">1108</date> and <date value="1114">1114</date>,
being among them. This identity of the primate with the
late bishop of Rochester may have given rise to the archbishop's regular residence in the suburban manor-house..
The archbishop continued to live where he had lived
when he was only bishop. To judge by the frequency
of Lambeth consecrations<note place="foot" n="5">See Stubbs, ' Episcopal Succession,' p. 26, &amp;c.</note> in the succeeding years,
not only Ralph, but William of Corbeuil, and Theobald,
his successors in the primacy, habitually resided here.







                 <pb n="271" id="p.271"/>

Of Thomas Becket two consecrations only are recorded,
and they are both at Canterbury. There is, in fact,
nothing to connect the great martyr of the twelfth century with Lambeth, though by one of those curious
coincidences which history so constantly offers, the sole
institution dedicated to St. Thomas of Canterbury which
has survived the zeal of Henry VIII. is now, so to speak,
next door to the manor-house of Lambeth.  A house
belonging to Geoffrey Becket, the saint's father, at Southwark, where, according to some accounts, the saint himself
was born, had been made, in the reign of Henry III., into
a hospital. At the dissolution, St. Thomas's Hospital,
purchased by the citizens, became an infirmary for the
poor. In <date value="1871">1871</date> it was removed<note place="foot" n="6">To make room for the railway from <placeName key="Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> to London Bridge
and Cannon Street.</note> to its present situation,
over against the Houses of Parliament, where the fragment of an embankment protects it, and the archbishop's
house beside it, from the incursions of the tide. Strange
that the hideous redness of its ungraceful pavilions should
spoil the best views of the time-worn towers of St.
Thomas's successor at Lambeth !</p>
<p>  Many public ceremonials took place at Lambeth
during the primacies of Richard and Baldwin. The
place gradually became identified with the archbishops;
so much so, indeed, that Baldwin, during his quarrel
with the priory at Canterbury, actually proposed to
remove the bones of St. Thomas and to found a church
in his honour, some say at Lambeth itself, some say at
Southwark close by. A church of St. Thomas <soCalled>in the
Green</soCalled> is spoken of about this time as being among the
possessions of the canons of Rochester. It may be the
same with the church of St. Thomas <soCalled>in the hospital.</soCalled>
When Hubert Fitzwalter had been three or four years




<pb n="272" id="p.272"/>

seated in the chair of St. Thomas, a negotiation was
begun and partly completed, by which, in exchange for
the manor and advowson of Darenth, in Kent, the bishop
and monastery at Rochester gave Lambeth, manor and
church, pastures and woods, salmon and lampreys, absolutely to the archbishop and his successors, by whom it
was speedily annexed to the see of Canterbury.</p>
<p>  The manor-house of Lambeth has continued ever
since the chief residence of the archbishops.<note place="foot" n="7">A very interesting account of archiepiscopal Lambeth, in its political
aspects more particularly, may be found in Mr. Green's ' Stray Studies.'</note> Archbishop Potter (<date value="1715">1715</date>-<date value="1737">1737</date>) was the first to call it a
palace, but official documents are still dated apud domum,
<soCalled>at our house,</soCalled> at Lambeth. When Addington was
bought, Lambeth had been for some years the only
remaining residence of a prelate who, in the middle ages,
had been able to travel from Harrow to Canterbury and
from Canterbury far into Sussex without resting a night
in any but his own houses. The difference between an
episcopal palace and a <soCalled>house</soCalled> seems to have been
correctly drawn in the definition of a palace as <quote>a term
appropriated to the mansion of the bishop in the city
that gave name to the see.</quote><note place="foot" n="8">Denne. quoted by Allen, 'History of Lambeth,' p. 183.</note> If it be so, the archbishop
of Canterbury has no palace; and the bishop of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>
is in the same predicament unless London House, in St.
James's Square, <quote>in the city of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,</quote> can in
any sense be described as <quote>in the city that gives name
to the see.</quote></p>
<p>  The great state kept here in old times and down
almost to the present by the archbishops is often noticed
in contemporary accounts. When Laud was appointed,
in <date value="1633">1633</date>, the king expressly ordered him to carry himself
with the same state and dignity as his predecessors had






                     <pb n="273" id="p.273"/>

before used and enjoyed; an injunction which he took,
as it was probably meant, to refer not to his immediate
predecessors, but to the great archbishops before the
Reformation, when, to speak of the hospitality alone,
there were generally three tables spread in the hall-one
for the -archbishop and his guests, persons only of the
upper nobility or high in office; the second, at which
sat the upper clergy, such as bishops and abbots, under
the chairmanship of the almoner; and the steward's
table, at which sat ordinary people, such as mere gentlemen. It was thought very condescending of Cranmer
that he admitted his suffragan, Thornden, bishop of
Dover, to his own table. Parker had a table set at the
lower end of the hall, <quote>whereat was dailie entertained
eight or ten of the poor of the town by turns.</quote> This
archbishop dined in state three times a week, when he
would invite, among others, the state prisoners whom
queen Elizabeth had quartered on him, such as Essex,
before he was sent to the Tower, and Sussex, his friend,
and a brother of the duke of Norfolk.  Melancholy
parties they must often have been, with Westminster
Hall in sight and Tower Hill in a not very distant
perspective. The archbishop lodged them handsomely
and charged them nothing, <quote>saving at their deths he
had from them some part of their libraries that thei
had thar.</quote><note place="foot" n="9">Parker, quoted by Allen, p. 239.</note></p>
<p>  The collection of a library by other means than the
impounding of the books of poor noblemen who had
lost their heads was the care of many archbishops. At
the great rebellion, when the manor-house was sold for
<date value="7000">7000</date>&#x00A3;. to Scott and Hardy, who speedily quarrelled over
their bargain, the books were with difficulty saved.
Selden claimed them for the University of Cambridge,








<pb n="274" id="p.274"/>

under some forgotten provision in archbishop Bancroft's
will, and though they had already gone to Sion College,
and many had been lost, a fair number survived to
return after the Restoration and remain still at Lambeth.
One volume only bears the arms of the unfortunate
Laud,<note place="foot" n="10">I have seen at a sale a folio prayer-book with the arms of Laud quite
visibly impressed on pasteboard covers from which the leather had been
stripped.</note> and one those of Parker, but many must have
belonged to both, being sometimes religious works of
doubtful orthodoxy retained by the archbishop when
they were sent for his imprimatur.   Among them    are of
course books which occur nowhere else, and are for that
reason, if for no other, very valuable. Old accounts of
the library always notice a volume<note place="foot" n="11">'The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers,' translated by earl
Rivers, who is represented introducing his scribe or illuminator to
Edward IV. Dated <date value="1476">1476</date>.</note> among the manuscripts which was supposed to contain a portrait of
Caxton, the first English printer, though how his likeness
could come to be in an unprinted book written by another
person was not explained. Another book which bore a
false character was only identified a few years ago as a
portion-the New Testament-of the famous Bible, undated, which is believed to have been the first book
printed with movable type. After passing for centuries
as a manuscript, for it is printed on vellum and
beautifully illuminated, it was found to be a printed
book in <date value="1871">1871</date>.<note place="foot" n="12">'Arch. Journ.,' <date value="1872">1872</date>. It was a complete copy of this book which

<p>  The chapel is probably the oldest of the existing
buildings, being always attributed to Boniface of Savoy,

for the scandal he had caused by his assault on the
prior of St. Bartholomew. It is difficult to see how a
chapel at Lambeth could atone for an injury at Smithfield, and it is very possible that Boniface only completed
what others had begun. At Canterbury his contribution
to the rebuilding of the palace was the payment of the
expenses left him by his predecessors:  <quote>I seem, indeed,</quote>
he complained, with some reason, <quote>to be truly the
builder of this hall, because I paid their debts.</quote></p>
<p>  Laud found the old windows very much broken, and
set himself, with the help of his secretary, to make out
the story of each and repair them. The Commons, at
his trial, alleged against him that he had taken the
pictures out of a mass book. They contained the whole
history of the world from the Creation to the Day of
Judgment, with types and antitypes, and must have
closely resembled the windows which still in part remain
at Canterbury of a slightly earlier date.  All were destroyed in <date value="1643">1643</date>, when, as one historian quaintly says in
the words of Scripture, the Reformers  <quote>under pretence
of abhorring idols, made no scruple of committing
sacrilege.</quote> They were not content with this desecration, but Hardy, the first purchaser of the house, dug up
the body of archbishop Parker, which had been buried
at <quote>that part of the chapel where he used to pray,</quote> and
selling the coffin for old lead, deposited the remains in
the stable yard, whence they were afterwards recovered
by the care of Sir William Dugdale, under the orders of
Juxon, and are now buried under a plain altar tomb at
the south side of the western end.</p>
<p>  A complete history of the archbishops' residence at
Lambeth would be a history of England. Many ancient
chambers perished when archbishop Howley rebuilt the
domestic part of what must have been a very inconvenient





<pb n="276" id="p.276"/>

dwelling-house. But we can still identify the
court into which More looked down from a window
while the clergy pressed to take the new oath of allegiance,<note place="foot" n="13">Green's 'History,' vol. ii. p. 168.</note> though the chamber, in which he assured
Cranmer of his own final refusal, is gone. It was probably from the same gallery that queen Elizabeth heard
a sermon when a movable pulpit was placed in the
court for the preacher. The gate is much as it was left
by cardinal Morton, the Chancellor of Henry VII., but it
has recently been scraped and pointed by way of <quote>restoration.</quote> The hall is Juxon's, and now contains the
library, but in the original building Pole's body must
have lain in state for the forty days before it was
removed to Canterbury; and here, long before, the duke
of Brittany did homage to Edward III., and the rebels
of <date value="1381">1381</date> drank the archbishop's wine.</p>
<p>  Of the memorable scenes at Lambeth in later times it
would be impossible to make even a catalogue here. But
it is not easy to pass the corner by the gate and the
church tower and not remember the winter night in <date value="1688">1688</date>
when queen Mary of Modena cowered with her infant
beneath the old walls, while the rain beat on her head
for an hour before even a common coach could be procured to take her to Gravesend; or that June evening,
three years later, when Dr. Sancroft, sometime archbishop, walked out from under Morton's archway, and
took a boat for the Temple, on his way into the retirement of his native village; or the strange scene presented
by the appearance of czar Peter in the chapel at the
ordination of a priest by archbishop Tenison.</p>
<p>  In Lambeth church were buried archbishops Bancroft,
Tenison, Secker, Hutton, and Cornwallis, as well as
bishops Thurlby and Tunstall, who had been prisoners







                         <pb n="277" id="p.277"/>

in charge of archbishop Parker. Ashmole, the antiquary,
was buried in the church, and Tradescant, whose collections went to augment those of Ashmole at Oxford, in
the churchyard.</p>
<p>  Stockwell and Vauxhall are ancient manors in the
parish, which extends uphill from the river's bank to the
Crystal Palace, and is a good example of the long,
narrow pattern after which so many old parishes were
modelled, comprising a piece of high ground, a belt of
forest, and a meadow in the valley. A third manor is
more interesting.    Kennington   has undergone greater
vicissitudes than Lambeth.    In its earlier history it is
usually connected with the death of Harthacnut in <date value="1042">1042</date>,
and sometimes with the coronation of Harold. But it is
quite certain that Harold was crowned across the water
at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and it may be considered more than
probable that Harthacnut died at the house of Osgod
Clapa, perhaps in the adjoining manor of Clapham.<note place="foot" n="14">It has been objected to this derivation of Clapham, Clapa's home or
ham, that in the register of Chertsey Abbey a gift of 200 pence from lands
at Clappeham in the time of king Alfred, is recorded. But the register is
of a date many centuries later than the gift, and the name may have been
used, in reciting it, for convenience.</note>
At the wedding feast of Gytha, Osgod's daughter, with
Tovi, a noble Dane, he fell down and died suddenly, after
an excessive draught of wine. The chronicle places the
event at Lambeth.</p>
<p>  At the time of the survey Kennington belonged to
Teodric, the king's goldsmith,<note place="foot" n="15">' Teodricus aurifaber tenet de rege Chenintune.'</note> who held of the king, as
he had held in the time of the Confessor. In the reign
of Richard I. the king had possession of it, and made
Robert Percy his steward.    Henry III.<note place="foot" n="16">This king is said to have held a Parliament at Kennington (Wilkinson,
i. 149), but it was probably only a council or conference.</note> gave the office





<pb n="278" id="p.278"/>

to Richard Freemantell. Edward I. sometimes resided
at Kennington, which must have been one of the most
convenient hunting grounds within easy reach of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. It belonged a few years later to the king's
cousin, the earl of Surrey; but Edward II. obtained it
from the earl in <date value="1316">1316</date>, and gave it shortly after to one of
his foreign favourites. Three years later he granted it
away again, it having probably reverted to the crown at
one of the periodical banishments of aliens, and in <date value="1322">1322</date>,
having a third time resumed it, he gave the manor to the
Despencers. The heiress of one of the previous grantees
obtained it on the attainder of the Despencers, and it came
back to the crown for the last time when Edward III.
exchanged for it some lands in Suffolk. He made it a
portion of the endowment of the duke of Cornwall,
and it still belongs to the lands of the duchy.</p>
<p>  After the death of the Black Prince, the young
Richard and his mother lived at Kennington, and here,
just before the old king, his grandfather died, a strange
scene, recorded by several annalists, took place in the
manor-house. It was early in the year, in Lent. The
duke of Lancaster, Richard's uncle, had been at a feast
in the city at the house of William de Ypres,<note place="foot" n="17">In Great St. Thomas Apostle, City.</note> a Flemish
merchant of great wealth. As they were about to sit
down to eat oysters, we are told, a soldier burst in with
the news that the mob, incensed at the duke for his
behaviour to bishop Courtenay in St. Paul's at a Synod
to which Wycliffe had been cited,<note place="foot" n="18">See above, vol. i., chap. viii.</note> were assembled at the
gates of his house at the Savoy, clamouring for his blood.
Leaving their oysters untasted, the duke and his companion lord Percy, who had also made himself unpopular, rushed to the river-side, and took a boat for





                 <pb n="279" id="p.279"/>

Kennington, on the opposite bank. Arrived there they
threw themselves on the protection of the princess and
her son, who, young as he was, had a few days before been
commissioned to open Parliament in his grandfather's
name, and who was already a personage of consideration.
The princess comforted them as best she could, "promittens," says one chronicler, in very English Latin, <quote><foreign lang="LA">se
facturum talem finem de hiis omnibus, qui foret eis satis
accommodus.</foreign></quote> And she appears to have been as good
as her word.</p>
<p>  A little before this event Kennington had seen a more
cheerful sight. A hundred and thirty of the principal
citizens rode out on Candlemas night disguised as mummers <quote>to Kennington, besides Lambeth,</quote> and made presents to the prince and his mother, who was still <quote>the
Fair Maid of Kent</quote> in their eyes, though a few years
later her popularity had waned. The maskers had provided themselves with loaded dice, and having by dumb
show indicated their desire to throw on the table with
the prince, they so arranged that he <quote>did alwais winne
when he came to cast at them. Then the mummers set
to the prince three jewels, one after another, which were
a boule of gold, a cup of gold, and a ring of gold, which
the prince wonne at three casts.</quote> Richard, to the end of
his life, seems to have thought the dice were always
loaded in his favour.</p>
<p>  Though <persName key="Tyler, Wat">Wat Tyler</persName>'s rebels four years later sacked
Lambeth they spared Kennington, and we do not hear
much of it until Henry VII. rested there just before his
coronation. Queen Elizabeth on her way to Greenwich
does not seem to have honoured Kennington with a visit,
but stayed with the archbishop at Lambeth; and the
house probably fell into decay, for in the next reign it
was completely rebuilt by James I. for Henry, Prince of

Wales. A few years later we find a survey made of the
manor of Kennington, with the rights, members, and
appurtenances thereof lying and being in the county of
Surrey, <quote>late parcel of the possessions of Charles Stuart,
eldest son of Charles Stuart, late King of England, as
part of his Duchy of Cornwall.</quote> The house was probably pulled down at this time, and we hear no more of
Kennington as a royal residence, though as late as <date value="1786">1786</date>
two large vaults were discovered; <quote>but whether of Saxon
or Gothic architecture is out of the power of any person
living to determine,</quote> says Allen, writing in <date value="1827">1827</date>, when
he should have known better. A long barn and a few
other outbuildings remained almost down to our own
day, but rows of houses, terraces and villas, taverns,
shops and churches, have obliterated even the ground
plans.<note place="foot" n="19">Mr. Henry MacLauchlan published a map of the old roads and
boundaries and an interesting paper on the last remains of the manor-house
in the ' Archaeological Journal' in <date value="1872">1872</date>.</note> The house stood near what are now Park Street
and Park Place.</p>
<p>  The Vauxhall Gardens, mentioned by Addison as
having been visited by Sir Roger de Coverley, were
situated close to the foot of Vauxhall Bridge, and had a
longer lease of life than is usual with suburban places of
amusement, as they subsisted until a few years ago from
the reign of Charles II. Hogarth in his day, was employed on the decorations, and designed the tickets,
which, cast or chased in precious metals, are still sought
after by collectors of curiosities.</p>
<p>  Kennington Common has been kept tolerably open,
and the Oval is celebrated now for cricket matches.
The church, St. Mark's, is said to stand on the old place
of public execution for the county, the scene of Shenstone's coarse but affecting ballad, "Jemmy Dawson."</p>

<p>  Opposite <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, and a little higher up the river than
Lambeth, is Battersea. The name has been almost as
much the subject of guesswork as that of Lambeth. It
is given in the Domesday Book as Patricesy, for which
reason Aubrey derives it from St. Patrick. But the
church is dedicated to St. Mary. A much more probable
derivation therefore, is that offered by Lysons:  <quote>as the
same record which calls it Patricesy, mentions that it
was given to St. Peter, it is not improbable that it was
so called in consequence of that donation.</quote><note place="foot" n="20">'Environs,' i. 19. A recent writer contrives to sum up both derivations
in a single ambiguous sentence;- <quote>Battersea, or Patrick's-eye, is said to
have taken its name from St. Patrick or St. Peter, because in ancient days
it belonged to the Abbey of St. Peter at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</quote></note> This is
not, however, quite satisfactory, because it must have
had a name before it was <quote>given to St. Peter,</quote> and that
name appears even then to have been Battersea, or
Peter's Ey. But the name may have been that of an
ancient owner, Peter; or it may have arisen from the
fact that at a much earlier period than the date of
the compilation of the Domesday Book, a considerable
portion of the parish belonged to another abbey of St.
Peter, that, namely, of Chertsey. But by a curious
coincidence the most eminent in the list of vicars was
the famous bishop Patrick, who held Battersea from <date value="1657">1657</date>
to <date value="1675">1675</date>, and was vicar here when he and Dr. Jane had
a conference in the presence of James II. with two priests
of the Church of Rome. The Protestant divines got
so much the better of their opponents, that the king
<quote>retired in disgust, saying, that he never heard a good
cause so ill defended, or a bad one so well.</quote></p>
<p>  The parish of Battersea in its original state reached
to Penge, and was bounded on the east by Lambeth,
and on the west by Wandsworth: a part of Clapham





<pb n="282" id="p.282"/>

Common belonging to the inhabitants. Penge Common,
of which but little now remains, was once two miles in
circumference, and joined Battersea on that side to
Beckenham. Here we are only concerned with that part
of the old parish which is near the river-side. Strange
to say, though it is so much nearer <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, it has retained its rural appearance better than the more distant
Penge. Battersea Park, which lies along the Thames
bank from the <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> Suspension Bridge to the Albert
Bridge, which crosses at Cheyne Walk, is very accessible
to the inhabitants of both banks, and is admirably laid
out. It was formed in <date value="1858">1858</date>, after some six years of
delay and preparation, and occupies 185 acres of what
was previously in great part low marshy ground. The
colonnade which once adorned the courtyard of Burlington House, in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, was removed to Battersea
Park, but by some strange neglect on the part of the
authorities, the numbered stones lie there to suffer decay
from damp and frost, and have never been set up.</p>
<p>  A little way south-west from Battersea Park formerly
stood the mansion of the St. Johns: and here Henry St.
John, the statesman, lived and died in retirement, after
his return from abroad. He had been living at Dawley,
near Harlington, in Middlesex,<note place="foot" n="21">There is an interesting account of Dawley in Thorne, i. 138.</note> for ten years or more,
when, after a few years in France, on the death of his
father, he became possessed of Battersea, being already
sixty-four years of age. The St. Johns were a long-
lived race.  Bolingbroke's father lived to be almost
ninety. His story was even more strange than that of
his son: for he was under sentence of death for upwards
of half a century. During an after-supper quarrel at
the Globe Tavern, in which he and several other young
gentlemen took part with drawn swords, Sir William





                  <pb n="283" id="p.283"/>

Estcourt<note place="foot" n="22">He was the third baronet of Newton, Wilts, and at his death the title,
created in <date value="1627">1627</date>, became extinct. His elder brother, Sir Giles, had been
killed in Italy.</note> was killed. It was, and always remained, a
question who had killed him, but Henry St. John, as he
was then, and another youth were accused. Finally, as
proof was weak, St. John was advised to confess, and
promised lenient treatment if he did so. He complied,
was convicted, and sentenced to die. It was then found
that by some legal technicality the king could not
pardon him. He was, however, indefinitely reprieved,
but his estates were forfeited, and he had to pay 16,000&#x00A3;.
for their redemption. There is a proverb about threatened lives, and certainly lord St. John's was no exception. In <date value="1712">1712</date> his son Henry, the statesman, was made
viscount Bolingbroke, with remainder to his father. In
<date value="1714">1714</date>, the viscount was attainted, and his title forfeited
during his lifetime at least: but in <date value="1716">1716</date> old Sir Henry
was himself made a viscount as lord St. John, and the
son, after losing the title he had acquired for himself,
inherited that of his father in <date value="1742">1742</date>. Both are still
extant, and are held by a descendant of his brother, for
the attainder did not affect the Bolingbroke peerage after
its original grantee was dead, owing to the clause of remainder.  There would be something more than usually
strange in the whole story, even if the people concerned
were of the most ordinary character. But, stranger still,
it seems as if it was at one time the normal state of the
St. John family to be put under sentence of death and afterwards to attain a viscountcy: for in the reign of Elizabeth
Oliver St. John killed one Best, of the queen's bodyguard, and had to fly. He joined the army in Ireland,
performed prodigies of valour, was given the manor of
Battersea by James I., and was made viscount Grandison.




<pb n="284" id="p.284"/>

He left no children, and bequeathed Battersea to a
nephew, whose grandson was also in trouble with the
authorities, but not till after his death, for his funeral at
Battersea was conducted with so much state and solemnity, that the heralds prosecuted his executor.<note place="foot" n="23">Lysons, 29. A similar prosecution is mentioned in chap. xix.</note> Magnificent as the ceremony was, more becoming a duke
than a baronet, there is no entry of the burial in the
parish register.</p>
<p>  Battersea church was rebuilt in <date value="1777">1777</date>, but the monuments of the St. Johns and others were carefully preserved, an example to the professing restorers of our own
day   Among them is one to lord Grandison; and one
to Sir Edward Wynter, who died in <date value="1686">1686</date>, having performed some remarkable feats of strength, which are
carved on his tomb, and celebrated in his epitaph :<note place="foot" n="24">Cunningham, i. 65.</note>

which had not been entirely taken off) by zeal to maintain the liberty, and to restore the ancient prosperity of
Great Britain.</quote></p>
<p>  Some fragments of Battersea house remained in the
occupation of a miller till very lately. The estate was
sold soon after Henry St. John's death to the Spensers,
who had already inherited the almost adjoining manor
of Wimbledon. The archbishops of York had for some
centuries a villa at Battersea, the site of which is still
pointed out.</p>
<p>  East of Lambeth and Kennington, and occupying the
centre of the peninsula, is Newington. A farm or settlement outside the walls of Southwark was very early
known as Walworth, a name sufficiently indicative of
the situation. It is called Waleorde in Domesday Book,
and having been given by king Edmund to his jester,
"Nithardus," perhaps Neatherd, in English, was by him,
on his repentance, and on the eve of a pilgrimage to
Rome, given to the church of Canterbury, to which, or to
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, it still belongs. Walworth was the only manor in Newington, which, indeed,
seems to have sprung into a separate existence since the
Conquest. It is not mentioned in Domesday, and the
name may signify <soCalled>new town.</soCalled> In <date value="1066">1066</date> the land on
which <soCalled>Neweton,</soCalled> or <soCalled>Newenton,</soCalled> as it seems to have
been called at first, was actually under water. It still
lies very low, though it has been greatly banked up, but
such a name as that of Newington Causeway, which still
belongs to one of the streets, is enough to betoken the
nature of the site.<note place="foot" n="25">Lysons mentions a flood in <date value="1755">1755</date>, during which people were conveyed

Newington, at the other side of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. The butts
were used by archers when Walworth and Newington
were open fields. They are first mentioned in <date value="1558">1558</date>.</p>
<p>  The eastern side of the peninsula, which I have
described as being formed by the great bend of the
Thames at <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, was occupied by a monastic manor,
now covered by, perhaps, the most noisome and unsavoury corner of the suburbs. There are no offensive
smells in any other town which may not be matched or
surpassed in Bermondsey, among the tanners, the floorcloth makers, the soap-boilers, the candle-moulders, and
a hundred others, some of whose trades are too offensive
for mention, yet here a few centuries ago invalids came
on account of the purity of the air, and one king, at
least, with several queens, may be named as having
resorted to Bermondsey and Rotherhithe for health.</p>
<p>  Who was the Bermond<note place="foot" n="26">Bermond has a Danish sound. Rotherhithe would seem to be the
ancient form of the second name, and to point very directly to redhra,
a rower, or mariner in general.</note> that gave his name to the
"ey," or "ait " ? What is the meaning of Rotherhithe?
Was there an island here, a refuge of rowers, or an archipelago or a peninsula? It is evident from the map that
the Roman road to Dover passed by Bermondsey and
left it well to the east. There was, therefore, less embanking of the Thames shore here than at Southwark,
and the ground must have naturally stood higher to have
been reclaimed at all. No doubt the monks did much
to improve their rich lands and to let in no more water
than was good for their crops.  The vinegar-makers
profit by their labours, but Bermondsey must always
have lain very low and been very damp.<note place="foot" n="27">See Chapter i. for some remarks on the levels.</note></p>

<p>Bermondsey belonged before the Conquest to Harold,


                 <pb n="287" id="p.287"/>

and has special mention in Domesday Book for its <quote> new
and handsome church.</quote><note place="foot" n="28"><quote><foreign lang="LA">Nova et pulchra ecclesia</foreign>.</quote></note>  It continued to be a royal
demesne till <date value="1094">1094</date>,<note place="foot" n="29">The charter is undated, but must be of that year.</note> and when William Rufus gave it to
the priory of St. Mary, he retained that part which is
now Rotherhithe, though in his charter there is no special
exception made; <quote>Rodereyam </quote> goes to <quote> Bermondesia </quote>
as well as <quote> Dilewich,</quote> and a hide in Southwark. Camberwell was also in the estate, and Henry I. formally
added Rotherhithe, so that the priory of St. Saviour,
which had been founded in <date value="1082">1082</date>, became extremely
wealthy, and its early importance is shown by its selection as his retreat from the world by the earl of
Mortaign, whose name occurs so frequently in Domesday. He had a hide of land and a house worth 8s. in
Bermondsey at the time of the survey. Another great
noble, Robert Marmion, in <date value="1113">1113</date>, gave the monks a
piece of ground named Withifleet; and in 1434 we can
identify it with the mills of  Widfleet and <quote>a certain
garden called Paris Garden.</quote></p>
<p>  The Cluniac monks at Bermondsey remained subject
to the abbey in Normandy, from which Aylwin Child,<note place="foot" n="30">Aylwin Child is sometimes supposed to be the father of Henry Fitz
Aylwin or Eylwin, first mayor of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</note>
a rich citizen of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, had brought them, until at the
request of Richard II., in 1390, John Attilburgh was
made first abbot by Boniface IX. The pope, however,
did not leave him long at Bermondsey, for towards the
end of the same year he was promoted to a bishopric in
Germany.<note place="foot" n="31">Of Athelfelden ?</note> The abbey was surrendered to Henry VIII.

<p>   That Bermondsey should have been selected as a
 health resort is one of the strangest facts in the history
 of mediaeval medical practice. Its reputation was, however, established by the accidental residence in the abbey
 of a monk who was supposed to understand the art of
 healing in an eminent degree.</p>
<p>   The princess of France, whom Henry V. had married
 so shortly before his death, and whose little son was
 already king of England and France, died at Bermondsey
 Abbey in <date value="1437">1437</date>. Her husband, Owen Tudor, the progenitor of the great dynasty of that name, is one of the
 most mysterious personages in English history. He was
 a prisoner in Newgate while his wife lay dying at
Bermondsey.<note place="foot" n="33">See above, vol. i. chap. ix.</note> We can only suppose that Katharine must
either have gone to Bermondsey to consult a physician,
and of her own free will, or because she was sent there
by the government of her brother-in-law and placed in
a kind of mild captivity. She left her three little sons
to the charity of their half-brother the king, himself then
only a boy of sixteen.</p>
<p>   Half a century later another queen came here to die.
Elizabeth Wydvile, already the widow of a simple
knight, had married a king, as Katherine, the widow of
a king, had married a soldier. Owen Tudor's grandson,
the son of one of the orphan boys bequeathed to
Henry VI. by his mother, was now on the throne of the
Plantagenets,<note place="foot" n="34">I use this name here for convenience and in contradistinction to Tudor,
though it would be easy to prove that none of the Angevin kings called
themselves by it. Edward IV. gave it as a surname to his illegitimate son,
Arthur, Lord Lisle.</note> and Elizabeth Wydvile's daughter was
his wife. So had the world gone round.  But neither
physicians nor the Redriff air could cure her malady,
and in 1492 her body was conveyed with sumptuous

ceremonies from Bermondsey to the grave of Edward IV.
at Windsor.</p>
<p>  The abbey church was taken down very soon after
the suppression by Sir Thomas Pope. He bought the
lease, at 10s. a year rent, which Sir Robert Southwell, Master of the Rolls, had obtained, with the
advowson of the parish, from Henry VIII. Pope made
himself a noble mansion out of the relics of the monastic
buildings. After ten years, however, Southwell, longing
perhaps for the fine air of Bermondsey, persuaded Pope
to let him have the house back. Eventually Pope sold
the manor and advowson to one Robert Trapps, a person
whom history has not distinguished except as the
ancestor of a family which retained the estate for a
century and a half. Sir Thomas Pope's house was afterwards the property of the Ratcliffes, earls of Sussex,
of one of whom, the father of Shakespeare's friend, who
died here in 1583, we read that he directed his executors
to spend 150&#x00A3;. in keeping his house open to all for
twenty-one days after his death. They actually spent
159&#x00A3;. 8s. 2d.</p>
<p>The parish church, another St. Mary, but this time St.
Mary Magdalene, has been so repeatedly altered and
rebuilt and restored, that it retains nothing of its ancient
features.  The parish register contains some curious
entries, as of the re-marriage in <date value="1604">1604</date> of a couple who had
long been separated, presumably by the sea, and the
woman married to another man.</p>
<p>  The unpleasant sights and smells of the district, the
crowd of small and miserable houses, and the general
fogginess of the situation are such that even enthusiastic
antiquaries hesitate to visit Bermondsey, though, from
the passage through it of the great modern highway, the
railroad to the south coast, its general features are but

too familiar to most of us; and the local names may
occasionally be studied from a carriage window. Neckinger Road,<note place="foot" n="35">Some ridiculous suggestions have been made as to the meaning of this
name: thus in 'Notes and Queries' (11 s. vol. 3, p. 417) it is derived from

to have been made by a great flood in <date value="1294">1294</date>. It occurred

chronicles as <soCalled>Le Breche.</soCalled> Maze Pond was probably
in the garden of the abbot of Battle, whose town house
was on a site in the track of the railway, and was long
commemorated    by Battle Bridge.   Sellenger Wharf
recalls the residence at Bermondsey of Sir Anthony
St. Leger, the lord deputy of Ireland in the reign of
Henry VIII., who had a grant of the town-house here
of the abbot of St. Augustine's, Canterbury. Abbey
Road and Grange Road lead to the little court known as
Bermondsey Square, which was once surrounded by
monastic buildings second in magnificence only to those
of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.<note place="foot" n="36">See Wilkinson's 'Londina Illustrata,' vol. i., for a series of views of
the abbey as it appeared sixty years since.</note></p>
<p>  Rotherhithe had a short separate existence when
Edward III. gave his land here to the abbey of St. Mary
of Grace on Tower Hill; but the grant was probably
disputed by the abbot of Bermondsey, as the land was
eventually given to him, perhaps we might say given
back to him. Up to the dissolution there is constantly
some confusion as to abbot's land and king's land; and
a grant from Henry VIII. to one Gerard Danett was
cancelled by an amicable agreement with the abbot in
<date value="1516">1516</date>. Henry IV. resided at Rotherhithe for the benefit
of his health, and two of his charters are dated there in

lies buried a hero of our nursery legends, Prince Lee

<p>THE rapid growth of the suburbs of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, combined
with the fact that since <date value="1855">1855</date> they have been under what
may be called a central government in certain particulars,
has rendered necessary the adoption of a name. The
largest city in the world was anonymous.   Its constituent parts had names, but as a whole it had none.
The interference of parliament was invoked, and unfortunately for accuracy a phrase was suggested which
in the wisdom of our rulers at that day sufficiently
described the great city. It was labelled the "Metropolitan Area."</p>
<p>  The use of the word "metropolis" as applied to
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> is of some antiquity. Howell coined a better
name as the title of his 'Londinopolis,' published in
<date value="1657">1657</date>. In De Laune's 'Present State of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>,' published after the Great Fire, though the author himself
does not use the term, an admirer who sends him an
<soCalled>Acrostick</soCalled> does not hesitate to turn a rhyme with it;
but the character of his authority may be judged by the
opening triplet of the poem:-
      <quote rend="blockquote">This is the City which the Papal Crew
        <lb/>Have by their Damn'd Devices overthrew,
        <lb/>Erected on her old Foundations, New.</quote>

  The poet goes on to praise the book:-
      <quote rend="blockquote">The Grandeur of this fam'd Metropolis,
        <lb/>Arts, Laws, and Customs thou hast shewn in this.</quote>







<pb n="293" id="p.293"/>

When the Board of Works was formed in <date value="1855">1855</date>, under
Sir Benjamin Hall's Act, the name was boldly assumed;
and the Board is appointed "for the purpose of diverting the sewage of the metropolis." Thenceforth this, so
to speak, diverting use of the word has been usual; and
the Board now deals with the whole Hundred of
Ossulston, the Hundred of Isleworth, certain districts on
the southern side of the Thames in the counties of Kent
and Surrey, and part of Essex. This constitutes the
"Metropolitan Area"; but <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, which probably the
framers of the Act contemplated under the name of
the metropolis, is itself manifestly excepted.</p>
<p>  The "Metropolitan Area" has been thus defined.<note place="foot" n="1">By Mr. Lewis in his 'Digest of the Census of <date value="1871">1871</date>,' p. 29.</note>
It is the " Metropolis " within the new tables of mortality,
as constituted for all registration, census and poor law
matters, and the term is further used for the district over
which the Metropolitan Board of Works has jurisdiction.
This district does not quite coincide with that concerning which the Registrar-General is busied: since the
hamlet of Penge<note place="foot" n="2">Penge is, parochially or manorially, in Battersea.</note> is excluded, and    the hamlet of
Mottingham is included. There is again a third district
called the "Metropolitan Area" of the Police: it is
much more extensive than the "Metropolitan Area" of
the Registrar-General or the "Metropolitan Area" of
the Board of Works, and extends over the whole of
Middlesex<note place="foot" n="3">Mr. Lewis adds in a bracket, <quote>exclusive of the city of <placeName key="London">London</placeName></quote> : but
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> is not and never was in Middlesex. It would be almost as sensible
to talk of the whole of Norfolk, exclusive of the city of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>. It is this
misuse of names on the part of officials that has given us the bewildering
term "Metropolitan area," which really means, if it means anything,
Canterbury.</note>    and  <quote>the  surrounding   parishes in the
counties of Surrey, Kent, Essex, and Hertford of which



<pb n="294" id="p.294"/>

any part is within twelve miles from Charing Cross, and
those also of which any part is not more than fifteen miles
in a straight line from the same point. The police circle
round <placeName key="v">Charing Cross</placeName> contains all that can be reckoned
as properly within the limits of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, and is too
extensive for a natural boundary.  For many of the
parishes within the police district are entirely rural, and
are quite sequestered from the great city, while at several
points are large towns, of which Croydon is an example,
chiefly bound to <placeName key="London">London</placeName> by the daily intercourse of their
population.</quote></p>
<p>  Yet again, there is the Metropolitan Postal District, and
it includes city and suburbs alike, consisting of the following divisions:-the E.C. lying close around the
General Post Office in St. Martin's-le-Grand; the E.
extending to Walthamstow, Leytonstone and North
Woolwich; the N. division reaching north from Pentonville nearly to Enfield and Barnet; the N.W. division
taking in Hendon and Willesden; the S.E. division
reaching from Vauxhall Bridge to Erith, and including
Norwood, Penge, and Lewisham; the S.W. division
extending westward along the Fulham Road, from
Charing Cross to Fulham, and southward as far as
Merton and Wimbledon; the W. division stretching out
to Acton, Ealing, and Hanwell; and the W.C. division,
lying between the City and Charing Cross.</p>
<p>  This Postal District, therefore covers an area as large as
that of the Metropolitan Board of Works, but is not nearly
so extensive as that controlled by the police.</p>
<p>  The immense size of this area is denoted by some
of the figures mentioned in the annual report of the
board. The money spent during a year is two and a half
millions. Besides the nine parliamentary boroughs, each
sending two members to the house of commons, no







  <pb n="295" id="p.295"/>

fewer than sixty distinct <quote>villages have in course of
time become constituent parts of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>.</quote> The area is
occupied by several thousand streets, <quote>which, if laid end
to end, would form a line 1,600 miles long.</quote>  There are
more than half a million different buildings and eleven
hundred churches. Within the police district the population is fully four millions.  <quote>There are in <placeName key="London">London</placeName> more
Scotchmen than in Edinburgh, more Irish than in Dublin,
more Jews than in Palestine, and more Roman Catholics
than in Rome.</quote> Compared with the Metropolitan Area,
even New York and Paris, the two cities of the world
which come nearest to it, are so far behind that both put
together would only equal it. The six cities of Great
Britain which come nearest to it are Glasgow, Liverpool,
Manchester with Salford, Birmingham, Leeds, and
Sheffield; but the population of all put together does not
equal that of the Metropolitan Area, even if the city of
<placeName key="London">London</placeName> be taken out. The rateable value is reckoned
to amount to upwards of twenty-five million sterling. The
whole valuation of the six English cities which come
nearest to the "Metropolitan Area" in population is, in
the aggregate, about ten millions and a half, so that the
value of the "Metropolis" is more than double. Great
sums expressed in numbers often convey a clearer idea
than any other form of statement, and certainly the
statistics offered by <placeName key="London">London</placeName> and its suburbs are almost
appalling.  Since it came into being the board has
made 65 miles of main sewers, besides making or
renewing 195 miles of smaller drains.  The immense
cost of works in the Area, the gigantic scale on which
everything has to be done, may be gathered from some
of the figures given in the annual reports. The Embankments cost three millions of money. The Fire Brigade
numbers more than five hundred men; and there were







<pb n="296" id="p.296"/>

more than one thousand eight hundred fires in 1880.
In the same time about a quarter of a million has been
paid for freeing bridges; and nearly 40,000&#x00A3;. for property
through which new streets are to pass. No fewer than one
hundred Acts of Parliament referring to the work of the
board have been passed in the twenty-six years of its
existence. The main drainage system cost four and a
half millions, and a few of the statistics have been thus
summed-up:- <quote>There are annually consumed about
2,000,000 quarters of wheat, 400,000 oxen, 1,500,000
sheep, 130,000 calves, 250,000 swine, 8 million head of
poultry and game, 400 million pounds of fish, 500 million
oysters, 1,200,000 lobsters, and 3,000,000 salmon. The
butcher's meat alone is valued at 50,000,000&#x00A3;.  The
Londoners wash down this vast annual repast by 180
million quarts of porter and ale, 8 million quarts of
spirits, and 31 million quarts of wine, not to speak of the
180 million gallons of water supplied every day by the
nine water companies. About 1000 collier-vessels yearly
bring 3,500,000 tons of coal into <placeName key="London">London</placeName> by the river,
while the railways supply about 3,000,000 tons more.</quote><note place="foot" n="4">Baedeker's 'Handbook." p. 60. These statistics are five years old,
and all the figures have been increased since they were compiled.</note></p>
<p>  The most extraordinary thing about this vast Area is
the looseness of its governing system. That it is well
governed no one can deny. Light and water are provided.
Crime is punished. Life is tolerably secure as well from
assassins as from pestilence. If dwellers in the Area are
robbed of their property it is at least under legalised
forms. Yet perhaps one of the most puzzling questions
a foreigner could put to an <soCalled>Arean,</soCalled> if I may invent a
name, would be involved in any inquiry as to how these
satisfactory results are attained. We have no prefects,
no mayors, no governors, no syndics. There are divisional




            <pb n="297" id="p.297"/>

police magistrates, but few of us have ever seen
one, and many of us live for years in a district without
learning the way to the nearest police court. There are
vestries, too, and we see their initials on watercarts, and
occasionally receive voting papers, from which we infer
that they are elected by the people. But, as a matter of
fact, nine-tenths of the dwellers in the <soCalled>Metropolitan Area</soCalled> know very little more, and cannot distinguish
between the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the
Board of Works, which is a department of the government of the country and used to be known as <soCalled>the
Woods and Forests,</soCalled> a title too picturesque for the
present age.</p>
<p>  The <soCalled>Metropolitan Board</soCalled> is annually elected and
consists of forty-six members, whose business it is to see
to the imposition and laying out of certain taxes, or
rates, or, as they would have been called in the 13th
century, tallages. The board has no magisterial jurisdiction. It is not a governing body.  It does not
concern itself with parochial matters. It waters no
streets and supplies no gas; but it sees that certain
conditions are fulfilled which make watering and lighting
possible. Its members project new streets, and obtain
parliamentary authority from time to time to contract
heavy loans on the security of their rates. They have
thus been enabled to make roads more direct in many
places, to relieve local traffic, to free bridges. Their
greatest and in some senses their best work is the
Embankment along the shores of the Thames from
Blackfriars to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, with shorter pieces at
<placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> and Lambeth, which cost two millions sterling,
and covers all the foreshore where twice a day there
used to be an unsightly mud flat. They also carried
out a drainage scheme, which according to some authorities






<pb n="298" id="p.298"/>

will have to be done over again. The sewage
question is, even more than the cemetery question, of
deep importance, and cannot be considered as in any
sense solved.</p>
<p>  This is not the place to go into full particulars of the
works projected or completed by the Metropolitan
Board. Nor need I describe the Underground Railway,
or the great stations, or electric lighting, or asphalte
pavement, or, in short, any of the wonders which a single
generation has seen springing into existence in our Area.
My object has rather been to trace those causes in the
past which are acting on us now, and, by piecing together
into a continuous narrative, so far as it was possible, the
many scattered circumstances which have contributed to
make <placeName key="London">London</placeName> what it is, to enable the student of history
to understand and explain things that may often seem
to be anomalous in our civic condition.</p>
<p>  In conclusion I would wish to point out one example
of the effect of ancient circumstances on our modern life.
It is common to talk as if the city had refused to take
in <soCalled>wards without,</soCalled> and that the orderly confusion, if I
may so term it, of our present parochial system arises
from a jealousy or indisposition on the part of the central
and ancient nucleus of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, to trouble itself about
suburbs. I hope I have shown that this is a mistaken
view. The city was never in demesne: the suburbs
were on land which belonged to various lords and was
parcelled out into various manors, each of which had its
courts and its manorial officers, as we have them to this
day in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. The citizens could not make way
against these forces. I have shown how the Fleet valley
was annexed, and with what difficulty. Had other great
merchants followed the example of Nicholas Farringdon
and bought manors close to the walls, a few more






                    <pb n="299" id="p.299"/>

exceptions might have arisen: but, as we have seen, the
greater part of the land was held by the dead hand of
the church against which even the wealthiest alderman
was powerless. The upstart nobles of the Tudor period
were not at all anxious to part with their newly acquired
dignity as lords of manors.  To them, therefore, and
before them to the church, but not to the city, we must
ascribe the present condition of the <soCalled>Metropolitan
Area.</soCalled>

<p>I have said that the division of the city into estates or holdings
was apparently older than the division into parishes. In another
place I have dated the settlement of the ward boundaries as having
occurred when Sir Ralph Sandwich was governor of the city. The
parish boundaries seem to have been fixed at a very early period.
They seldom coincide with the ward boundaries, but the two
systems are wholly independent of each other, as may be seen by
a glance at the map.</p>
<p>  It is difficult to put this problem in a clear light without over
stating the case. But the following notes may be taken for
what they are worth:-
<list type="simple"><item>  1. The earliest division of the city was into sokes, estates or
holdings, and these holdings developed on the one hand into
parishes, and on the other into wards.</item>
<item>  2. But, though the ward of Bassishaw is nearly the same as the
parish of St. Michael, no other parish is conterminous with a ward.</item>
<item>  3. The boundaries of parishes are determined by the backs of
the houses. The boundaries of the wards are determined by the
direction of main lines of thoroughfare.</item>
<item>  4. The wards were defined after the main thoroughfares had been
opened. Thus the boundary between the wards of Cripplegate and
Bread Street runs along Cheapside, and cuts off portions of the
two adjacent parishes of St. Peter's and St. Mary Magdalene. The
boundary between Bread Street and Queenhithe, again, runs along
the course of Old Fish Street, and crosses the parishes of
St. Nicholas Cole Abbey and St. Mildred.</item>
<item>  5. The date of the fixture of the present ward boundaries must
be near the end of the thirteenth century. It was made after the
old Guildhall in Aldermanbury was abandoned for the present site,








<pb n="368" id="p.368"/>

and in fixing the boundary of the ward of Cheap it was made to
include the Guildhall, which was then only 130 feet long. The
modern Guildhall is 153 feet long, and its eastern end is not in the
ward of Cheap but in that of Bassishaw, and not in the parish of
St. Lawrence but in that of St. Michael. We know that the Guildhall was on the present site before <date value="1294">1294</date>, because the Guildhall
yard is described as being on the eastern side of St. Lawrence's
church in the deed of that year by which the advowson was given
to Balliol College.<note place="foot" n="1">See Historical MSS. Commission, Fourth Report, p. 449.</note> But the ward of Cheap was not defined as it
is now in <date value="1273">1273</date>, because Walter Hervey, who was alderman of
Cheap, assembled his supporters in the church of St. Peter. This
church, which apparently was then in his ward, is now in that of
Bread Street. There are other reasons, some of which are stated
in the text, for choosing <date value="1290">1290</date> for the definition of the modern ward
boundaries, and probably many facts might be found of the same
character as these relating to St. Peter's and the Guildhall, all
tending to confirm the correctness of this date.</item>
<item>  6. Some parishes are in no fewer than three wards. St. Mary
Magdalene, Old Fish Street, for example, is in Castle Baynard,
Queenhithe, and Bread Street. St. Peter's, referred to above, is
now in Farringdon Within, Cripplegate, and Bread Street.</item>
<item>  7. The Watling Street, running diagonally through the market
place from St. Mary Aldermary to St. Michael le Querne, seems to
have been wholly obliterated and abandoned by the arrangement
of the booths. This may have been in consequence of the great fire
of <date value="1136">1136</date>, but Mr. T. Godfrey Faussett observed a similar abandonment of Roman lines at Canterbury: and the fact has been adduced
to prove that <placeName key="London">London</placeName> and Canterbury lay vacant after the Saxon
invasion. The old line is, however, preserved along Budge Row,
before the market place is entered, and in Newgate Street, after it
has been passed. From the parochial boundaries on the south
side of Newgate Street it will be evident that the houses were built
along a line which went diagonally from Cheap to Newgate, and
was, in fact, the line of Watling Street. In Cheap itself, on the
contrary, the parochial boundaries seem rather to respect the main
roads north and south which lead to Cripplegate and Aldersgate
from Queenhithe, of which Bread Street is an example. It follows,
therefore, that at the time the parochial boundaries were settled,
the original Watling Street was still in use at Newgate, but had
been lost in Cheap. This accords very well with what we know of


   <pb n="369" id="p.369"/>

the parochial history of Cheap. As long as it was covered with
booths or other temporary structures, or was wholly open, as at the
Standard, it was probably reckoned only in the two parishes of
St. Peter and St. Mary Aldermary. Subsequently smaller parishes
were formed. St. Mary le Bow was built in the middle of the
market place: and from its name evidently dates after the introduction of stone buildings and of vaulting. St. Mary Colechurch
was also cut off, and St. Mary Abchurch. St. Mildred's must also
be reckoned a late dedication-late that is, as compared with such
dedications as St. Peter's or St. Mary's, and St. Pancras is probably
the same. I should, in fact, be disposed to think the original
parish of St. Mary reached as far north as St. Mary Aldermanbury,
and St. Mary Staining; the latter, if "staining" refers to stone
building, being probably late, and the intervening parish of
St. Alban being undoubtedly of an ascertained age, and dating after
the grant of the parish to St. Alban's Abbey by Offa. We thus find
a great parish of St. Mary, the parish church of which appropriately
still bears the name of Aldermary, containing within its limits,
besides later foundations dedicated to other saints--one of them
being to St. Mary Magdalene-no fewer than six dedications of the
same name as that of the mother church. On the opposite side of
the Wallbrook is another great parish of St. Mary similarly broken
up into St. Mary Woolchurch, St. Mary Woolnoth, and St. Mary
Bothaw. Which of these was the mother church is unknown.
St. Mary Woolchurch was, we know (Newcourt, i. 459), built after
the Conquest: and it is very possible that these three parishes were
also part of St. Mary Aldermary at the other side of the Wallbrook,
for St. Mildred's parish was on both sides, as was St. Stephens.</item>
<item>  8. The thirteen peculiars of the archbishop of Canterbury seem
in most cases to have been late foundations. Does this point to any
interference of an archbishop to build additional churches after,
say, a fire? These peculiars are:-St. Mary le Bow, All Hallows
Lombard Street, St. Mary Aldermary, St. Pancras Soper Lane,
All Hallows Bread Street, St. John the Baptist, St. Dunstan in
the East, St. Mary Bothaw, St. Vedast, St. Dionis, St. Michael
Crooked Lane, St. Leonard Eastcheap, and St. Michael Paternoster.
Several are in and about Cheap. The dedications of St. Dunstan's,
St. Dionis, and St. Vedast are comparatively modern.</item>
<item>  9. It is interesting to find examples in which the boundaries of
wards or of parishes, as at Guildhall, are made to take in or leave
out certain buildings or holdings. The parish of St. Leonard in
its rectangular irregularity gives us the ground plan of the old







<pb n="370" id="p.370"/>

monastery of St. Martin le Grand. Therefore St. Martin was
already founded when the parochial boundaries were settled. So,
too, there is a " bulge " in the ward boundary to take in the outwork
of the fortified gate: but no corresponding "bulge " at Ludgate,
where the gate itself was inconsiderable. The parish boundary of
St. Peter le Poor takes in Drapers' Hall and garden, but excludes
those of the Carpenters.  I venture to suggest that a complete
study of the ward and parish boundaries would repay the
investigator.</item>
<item>  10. The modern Watling Street is old enough for us to have lost
  all trace of its documentary history. But as it does not form a
boundary, I venture to think we should be justified in concluding
that, comparatively speaking, it is a new street, at least in the
western part of its course. The Roman road of that name must
have emerged from Cheap near the south gate of St. Martin le
Grand. The new Watling Street may have been diverted into its
present course when the east end of Old St. Paul's was built,
perhaps in the early part of the thirteenth century. Documentary
evidence only begins with the end of that century.</item></list></p>
<p>  The above ten points are all overlaid with conjecture. But I
venture to think they are worth recording as at least suggestions
for the use of some future archaeologist.</p>
<p>  The accompanying map represents part of Cheap as it may have
been before buildings were erected on the lines of booths. I should
have been disposed to omit all the churches except St. Mary
Aldermary and St. Peter. But on consideration I have retained
them, partly as landmarks, partly because it is impossible to fix the
date of their foundation with more certainty than that indicated
above in paragraph 7. The ward boundary at the north-eastern
corner of St. Paul's is worth noting, showing as it does the
diagonal course of the original Watling Street, where it emerges
from Cheap and cuts off the corner of St. Paul's Churchyard. 'The
modern Newgate Street does not strictly follow the original line of
the Roman road, but runs across it, a little to the south in the
greater part of its course. The line of Bread Street was determined
by the roadway through the market to Cripplegate, by way of
Wood Street, a line which must be coeval with the opening of the
gate. I am almost sure that the field, "the Crown Field," sometimes mentioned as adjoining St. Mary le Bow, is a misreading of
"feld " for " seld," and that there was no field, but a shop or shed
on this spot.</p>

<p>STANFORD'S NEW OROGRAPHICAL SERIES OF
                            WALL MAPS.</p>
<p>For use in Schools and Colleges. Edited by A. C. RAMSAY, LL.D., F.R.S., &amp;c.,
       Director-General of the Geological Surveys of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>  This series of Orographical Maps has been prepared in order to supply the want
long felt in Schools where Physical Geography is taught, of good and reliable
scientific maps.
</p>  <p>This series aims at exhibiting in the first place, and prominently, the forms of
relief and of contour of the land masses of the globe, and next of the sea bed. At
once a general idea is gained by the youngest student, on an inspection of the Map,
of the relative position of the high, dry, and cold table-lands and mountainous
regions, and the warm, moist, and fertile plains in each great division of the globe.
For instance, in our own country it is seen at once why the eastern part is devoted
to agricultural purposes, and the western part to mining and manufacturing; or by
reference to the Map of Europe we can readily see how a rise in the level of the sea
of a few hundreds of feet would suffice to inundate the whole northern part of
Europe; and on the other hand, how the general upheaval of the land of a few hundreds of feet would alter the whole contour of Europe, connecting the British Isles
with the Continent, and annihilating the North Sea and the Baltic.</p>
  <p>The Maps are uniform in scale and size with the Political Series already in use,
and which have acquired so great a popularity; and will be found as accurate and
useful in teaching Physical Geography as the companion series are in Political
Geography.</p>
  <p>Some of the series have been adopted by the School Board for London.</p>
