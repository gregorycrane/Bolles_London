MY DEAR SIR JOHN BURGOYNE,

 </p><p>      A formal dedication to an officer of your European celebrity would require the enumeration of those
long, brilliant, and useful services by which you have
attained the well-merited honours and distinctions you
enjoy.
</p><p>
     However briefly such a list might be drawn out,
your military career ranges over so long a period, and is
so connected with the triumphs of the British arms in
almost every part of the world, that it would occupy a
space neither suitable to the humble pretensions of this
volume, nor agreeable to the simplicity and absence of
ostentation which marks your character.

 </p><p>    The latest honour conferred on you by the Queen
'was your appointment as Constable of the Tower, and
it is owing to this circumstance, which has placed me
under your command, that I venture to present you these
Memorials of The Tower as a tribute of respect and
regard.

 </p><p>           I am, my dear Sir John,
                     Very sincerely yours,
</p><p>
                                         DE Ros,
                                Lieut. - Governor of the Tower.
                                                </p>

<p>AMONG the objects of interest which attract the notice of
the stranger in London, perhaps there is not one which is
more generally popular than the Tower. Unfortunately.
its situation renders it less accessible than most of the
sights of London, not only from actual distance, but from
the prodigious throng of carriages of all kinds, which encumber and block the principal streets leading to Tower
Hill from the northern and western parts of the town.
In spite of these inconveniences, the Tower of London
appears to possess an universal attraction for all ranks
and classes, from the antiquary and historian to the
labourer and artizan, and from the distinguished foreigner
to the schoolboy taken out for a holiday of sight-seeing
and amusement.
</p><p>    It seems strange that no popular account of this venerable and celebrated Palace and Fortress should yet have
been offered to the public. Mr. Bailey's elaborate work
upon the Tower presents, no doubt, the result of a vast
quantity of laborious historical and antiquarian research
but it is too bulky in form (two large quarto volumes),
and gives too much dry detail, to suit the ordinary
reader; nor do the doubts in which he has shown such
an inclination to indulge, upon some of the most received




<pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/>

historical traditions, by any means add to the interest of
his book, though it bears, in many respects, the stamp
of diligent and careful inquiry.  Mr. Ainsworth has
regarded the Tower rather as a suitable scene for an
interesting work of fiction, than as a subject of historical
illustration.
 </p><p>    In attempting a Memoir of this Royal Palace and
Fortress, and of the most remarkable and notorious persons
who have been inmates of the Tower, it would be unjust
not to acknowledge the value of Messrs. Britton and
Brayley's book, as the most satisfactory reference for
most of the disputed questions of Tower tradition, as well
as for the general historical accuracy with which they
have treated the whole of the subject.</p>

<p>          BEFORE entering upon any personal details
            of the prisoners of historical notoriety who
            have been confined within the Tower, it may
            be well to present the reader with a brief
description of its actual condition, and of the various
Stores, Armouries, Prisons, Offices, and Chapels which are
contained within its precincts, especially as many of them
have of late years undergone considerable changes and
restorations, subsequent to the publication of the work of
Messrs. Britton and Brayley. Situated on the Middlesex
side of the Thames, about one-third of a mile below London
Bridge, and just outside the jurisdiction of the City, the
Tower in its general aspects resembles a small fortified
town, such as we find in many parts of Germany and
Flanders. But it is so hemmed in by a large and populous
suburb, that, although a stronghold against surprise by any
riotous or insurrectionary assemblage, and even against
  an attack by regular troops, unless provided with heavy





<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>
artillery, yet the Tower could not of course oppose any
prolonged resistance to a siege carried on by regular
approaches, and with the formidable battering train, which
would accompany such an operation in modern times.
  </p><p>  A wide dry ditch, capable of being flooded at high
tide, runs round the whole exterior of the Tower, commencing from the river at Tower Stairs, on the west,
and running round the whole outer wall or scarp, till
it again touches the Thames at Iron Gate Stairs, at the
eastern extremity of the ditch. Between the outer edge
of this ditch, and the open space of Tower Hill (the
margin of which represents what in military language
would be termed the " glacis "), there is a tolerably wide
strip of pleasure-ground or garden, open to the chief
inhabitants and residents, and managed by a committee
of official gentlemen connected with the Tower and the
Mint. The scarp or inner side of the Tower Ditch rises
into an elevated wall, with bastions at its angles, and
short, but heavy guns, distributed along the rampart, in
the positions best suited for command of Tower Hill and
its approaches.
  </p><p>    The main entrance of the Tower of London is
 through the Middle Tower on the outer side of the
 ditch; then across a causeway bridge, and through the
 fine old arch of the Byward Tower, which leads under
 the rampart into the interior of the fortress.
   </p><p>   The ramparts are " casemated," and contain Storerooms, Workshops, Magazines, Engine-houses, and Warders' quarters, being complete as far as the western and
 northern faces. The eastern face was, till lately, in a state

            <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>

of total dilapidation, the result of many years of neglect
on the part of the former Board of Ordnance, but is
now in rapid progress of restoration.
</p><p>Immediately within the ramparts, and between
them and the inner or " Ballium " wall (a military term
of the middle ages), there was until lately a narrow
street, known as Mint Street, with houses built at
different periods, and without order or arrangement,
against the rampart on the one side, and the " Ballium
wall" on the other, rendering the rampart of little service, and disfiguring, as well as rendering useless, the
ancient wall of the fortress. In this street were situated
the Royal Mint, Workshops, Barracks, and Stores, with
three or four warders' quarters, in a condition of ruin and
dilapidation, forming a great contrast to its present
appearance.  Among other objections to Mint Street
were two taverns, which former Lieutenant-Governors
or Lieutenants had allowed to be erected, for the sake
of the rents they received from them, amounting at one
period to several hundreds per annum, either unknown
or unnoticed by Government. The level of Mint Street,
though higher by many feet than the outer ditch, is lower
than the interior parade, in the middle of which is situated
the White Tower, which was the donjon or keep of the
ancient fortress, and is celebrated as the scene of some
of the darkest tragedies of the Tower of London.
   </p><p> The " Ballium " wall is of great thickness and solidity,
and of a height varying from thirty to forty feet. It has
every appearance of great antiquity, and is probably of
the same date as the White Tower, erected in William




<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>
the Conqueror's time, by Gundulph, Bishop of Rochester,
a prelate famous in his day for skill as an architec, and
engineer. The Ballium wall commences just inside the
main gate of the outer rampart, with a lofty tower (the
Bell Tower) forming the south-west angle of the Governor's
house. From thence a massive curtain wall, disfigured
unfortunately by modern brick buildings on the top,
runs northward for about fifty yards to the Beauchamp
Tower, which projects as a bastion about the centre of the
west face of the Ballium wall.</p></div2>
<div2 type="subchapter" n="State Prison" id="c1s2">
                   <head>STATE PRISON.</head>
 <p>   The Beauchamp Tower had from the earliest times
been appropriated as a state prison for those unfortunate
persons who were to be kept in close confinement without indulgence for air and exercise within the outer wall.
There are three stories in this Tower, but the middle one,
with a small dungeon beyond, was the prison. Its walls
tell a truly dismal tale, covered as they are with the sad
memorials of the names of successive prisoners of all ranks,
engraved in many instances with an elaborate care which
bears witness to the dreary weight of time which hung
upon their hands, and rendered the inscribing of their
names a melancholy resource under the privation of all
other interests and occupation. For a number of years
previous to the appointment of the late Sir G. Cathcart
as Lieutenant-Governor of the Tower, this State prison
had been disgracefully neglected, and fitted up by the
Board of Ordnance as a mess-room for the Officers of
the garrison, the niches being filled with cupboards and




      <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>

shelves, to the concealment, as well as injury, of the
inscriptions. Sir George was called from the Tower to
active service at the Cape, before his judicious plans
for restoring the Beauchamp Tower were yet completed,
but he had so efficiently set the work on foot, that no
difficulties were found by his successor in carrying them
out.  The detail was intrusted to Mr. Salvin, the
architect, whose admirable taste in restoration had been
fully displayed at Alnwick, Warwick Castle, and other
historical edifices of baronial times. Certainly a better
choice could not have been made, and nothing could
exceed the pains and care which he bestowed upon this
work, diligently tracing out every nook and corner where
restoration was practicable; and where that was no
longer possible, from the dilapidations having gone too
far, following implicitly the old models before him, till,
by the end of the second year, he had succeeded in the
perfect restoration of this celebrated tower.
  </p><p>    To avoid any future injury to the inscriptions on the
 inner walls, a preparation of an indurating nature was
 repeatedly rubbed over them to harden the stone, so that
 there is every reason to hope that the Beauchamp Tower,
 and its sad and interesting inscriptions, are now as secure
 against the effects of age, as skill and care can render them.
  </p><p>    A Warder is always in attendance in the prison room
  during the hours of visitation by the public, and it is his
  special duty to caution visitors against touching, even
  with the finger, any part of the walls and inscriptions.
  </p><p>    From the Beauchamp Tower, the Ballium wall is continued to the north-west corner of what may be called the







<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>

inner fortress, where stands the Devereux Tower, designated in Henry VIII.'s time as Robin the Devil's Tower,
perhaps a corruption of Robert le Diable. Along the
north face we find four towers, namely, the Devereux,
the Flint Tower, the Bowyer Tower, and the Brick
Tower. The Bowyer Tower is supposed to have been
the scene of the murder of the Duke of Clarence, Edward
IV.'s brother.
   </p><p>  Were there no other notoriety attached to the Tower
of London, the fact of our immortal dramatic poet having
selected its various localities for some of the finest scenes
of his historical plays, should be enough to invest it
with a more than common interest.
  </p><p>   It is enough to find in Shakespeare a scene headed
"A Room in the Tower," to be certain that what follows
will strike our imagination, or excite our sympathy, by
some powerful exhibition of the passions and feelings of
characters, who have acted conspicuous parts in the history of the early reigns of our monarchs, or the cruel
and implacable enmities of the Wars of the Red and
White Roses-wars which cut short the lives of nearly
a third of the nobility of England, either in the field or
on the scaffold. To quote Shakespeare, as an infallible
historical authority, would be as absurd, as it would be,
on the other hand, unreasonable not to give him credit
for faithfully handing down to us the " tale as 'twas told
to him," and commemorating in dialogue, as picturesque
as natural, those tragedies of real life, with which our early
history abounds. Whether he be always as correct in his
facts, as he might have been, by a more diligent investigation


   <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>

 of the chronicles existing in his day, it is at least
 certain that he seldom fails to portray with a spirit and
 fire, unequalled by any who have ventured on the path of
 historical drama, the chivalrous character of the ancient
 nobility of England, and the brave and honest nature of the
 yeomen and soldiers who followed them to those bloody
 fields, where the flower of English youth were sacrificed to
 the ferocity of civil war. In proceeding with the description of the interior of the Tower, a reference to the Scenes
 which Shakespeare has located in some of its most remarkable chambers and prisons, will, it is hoped, be acceptable
 to most readers. One of the first which occurs has been
 attributed by tradition to the Bowyer Tower.<note place="foot" n="1">RICHARD III., act i. scene 4. A room in the Tower.
              Enter CLARENCE and BRACKENBURY.</note>
   </p><p>   The north-east corner of the Ballium wall is formed
by the Jewel Tower, and, following round to the eastern
face, we come to the Broad-arrow Tower, at which point,
owing to the destruction of the Royal Palace and adjacent
buildings by Cromwell, the Ballium wall disappears.
 </p><p>  With an utter disregard of the character and requirements of the Tower, whether as an historical monument
of unequalled interest, or as a place of security for military
  stores, for the crown jewels, and for the curious and very
  valuable ancient armoury, the whole of this south-eastern
portion of the Fortress has for many years been given up
  to degradation by the erection of a modern range of
  military storehouses and sheds.
   </p><p>   Obscured by one of these buildings, stands the





<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>

ancient Salt Tower, lately restored by Mr. Salvin, to
whose judgment and skill the public were indebted for
the restoration of the Beauchamp Tower before mentioned, as well as for the beautiful inner elevation of the
northern and eastern casemates.
  </p><p>   The south-east corner of the Tower, where the Salt
Tower stands, was the site of the royal palace, an irregular building (to judge from some old prints which are
extant), extending from the south side of the White Tower,
over the ground now occupied by those modern buildings
of the Military Store department, which stand forth as
a monument of all that is low and unsightly in modern
architecture.
  </p><p>   During the Government of Oliver Cromwell, he gave
orders to put the Tower in a condition of defence, and is
believed to have procured most of the material for this
purpose from the ruins of the Royal Palace, which he took
early occasion to pull down to the very ground.  So
effectually was this destruction accomplished, that the
buttress of an old archway adjoining the Salt Tower is
now the only vestige of a Palace which was the secure
and stately residence of so many of our earlier monarchs.
The modern buildings of the Military Store department, which resemble a large factory rather than a
public edifice suitable to the character of the Tower,
are continued along the south or river face, to near
the centre, where the ancient Hall Tower, better known
as the Wakefield Tower, marks the re-commencement of
the Ballium wall.
 </p><p>   Next to the Wakefield Tower stands the Bloody



     <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>

Tower, opposite the celebrated water entrance of the
Traitors' Gate; then comes a massive curtain-wall, at
the back of which stands the Governor's house, and
some Warders' quarters, the windows of which are
pierced through the thickness of the wall (in most cases
above eight feet), but unfortunately disfigured by modern
brickwork at the top. This curtain-wall terminates westward at the Bell Tower, from whence the description of
the Ballium wall was commenced.
   </p><p> The exterior defences of the Tower on the southern
front consist of a low rampart (a prolongation of the
exterior casemated wall with the Tower wharf), between
it and the Thames, at the west end of which is a small
river terrace, laid down in gravel, and shaded by a row
of trees. The eastern part of this wharf is encumbered
and disfigured with modern workshops, wooden sheds,
and storehouses. Opposite to the Wakefield Tower, in
the Ballium wall, stands the fine old tower known as St.
Thomas's, under which, the wide stone archway, called by
the fatal name of the Traitors' Gate, admitted the barges
in which state prisoners were brought to the Tower from
Westminster.  From this arch there is an ascent of stone
steps, by which prisoners were conducted through the
Gate of the Bloody Tower to their cells or prison-rooms
within the inner or Ballium wall. From the Traitors'
Gate, the wharf extends westward to the Queen's Stairs,
and thence to the Byward Tower and Main Gate, ending
with the Tower stairs, which are just outside the defences
of the Tower. A beautiful restoration of St. Thomas's
Tower, the Traitors' Gate, and its noble arch, has just







<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>
been completed by Mr. Salvin, under the authority of
the Hon. W. Cowper, First Commissioner of Works, who
deserves every praise for this restoration of so curious an
historical building, and for intrusting the execution of the
work to such able hands as those of Mr. Salvin.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="Wakefield Tower" id="c1s3">
                <head>WAKEFIELD TOWER.</head>

   <p> The large Hall in the Wakefield Tower has been
always traditionally pointed out as the scene of Henry
VI.'s murder.
 </p><p>   After the total defeat of the Lancastrians at Tewkesbury, in 1471, and the murder of the young Prince of
Wales in presence of Edward, the life of Henry VI., a
captive in the Tower, became the only stake on which
further insurrections of the Lancastrians could be ventured.
  </p><p>  Edward was not a man to hesitate in such a case, and
on the evening of the day (May 22) on which Edward
made his entry into London, Henry was declared to
have died in the Tower. Grief and vexation were the
causes publicly assigned for his decease; but the common rumour of the day was that he had been stabbed by
the Duke of Gloucester, whose after-deeds as Richard III.
seemed to authorise the belief of his taking part in any
act of blood and cruelty."  The funeral was conducted
with little reverence or respect, the body being first taken

by torchlight to St. Paul's, and after to Chertsey, where
it was buried in the Abbey, " unreverently, without priest
or clerke, torch or taper, singing or saying."  Shortly
after the accession of Gloucester as Richard III., some
stories got abroad of miracles wrought at the tomb of the
murdered monarch, and the Usurper, in order to prevent
any impression being made by these tales upon the public
mind, caused the coffin to be disinterred, and removed to
the royal sepulchre at Windsor.

<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>

  </p><p>   The Wakefield Tower has a gloomy vault under its
base, where it was supposed that a number of distinguished
prisoners taken at the battle of Wakefield were confined,
but there seems to be no good reason for supposing that
such was the case; and indeed the barbarous custom
which prevailed, during the bloody struggle of the Red and
White Roses, of executing the principal leaders of the
defeated party immediately after the battle, renders it
unlikely that any number of them should have been transferred to London after the battle of Wakefield.
   </p><p>  But there is a more recent and better authenticated tradition that sixty or seventy of the Scots prisoners, after the Rebellion of 1745, were here placed in
 close confinement, and so little attention given to proper
 supplies of fresh air, and even food, that more than half
 of them perished from overcrowding and neglect, before
 the Government, at the instance of the Lieutenant of the
 Tower, caused them to be removed to less unwholesome
 quarters.
    </p><p>  From the time our Sovereigns ceased to make the
 royal palace within the Tower their occasional residence
 (James I. was the last who ever occupied it), great abuses
 have prevailed in the government and management as
 well as the necessary repairs within the Tower.  The
 Constables appointed from time to time seem only to have
 considered how they might derive most income from their
 high office, which was invested with almost unlimited
 local authority.  They sold the Warderships, allowed
 public-houses to be erected, even against the most
 venerable Towers and ancient buildings, and filled every



    <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>

corner with tenants, from whom they collected heavy
rents, allowing every sort of encroachment and dilapidation to proceed unnoticed.  Besides this, there had
existed within the Tower walls, and by royal permission
from very early times, a considerable Ordnance and Store
establishment for the supplies of the army. The Tower
has long been the depot for the muskets, swords, carbines,
and pistols issued to the troops, and the Storehouses
contained every article required for the furnishing of
barracks and hospitals.  During the pressure of the
Crimean war, stoves, tables, bedsteads, bedding, and all
sorts of clothing, were collected in vast quantities, and
fresh warehouses and storehouses were run. up on every
vacant spot that could be made available, with utter disregard of architectural appearance.
 </p><p>   As far back as the reign of Charles II. large barracks, capable of lodging a battalion of Guards, had been
constructed in the Tower, without any attempt at preserving the architectural style of the place. But, unfortunately, while the space within the Tower walls was
crammed with numerous unsightly buildings in the
worst possible taste, the old walls, the ditch, and the
ramparts, were suffered to fall into ruin. This state of
things would seem incompatible with the security of a
state prison; but it must be remembered that all the
Bastions and the Ballium or inner wall, and both the Gate
Towers, were appropriated to the double purposes of
state prisons and Warders' lodgings, each Warder or
Gaoler having charge of his prisoner, and being answerable





<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>

for his safe custody, in strong rooms, with barred
windows and iron-plated doors.
  </p><p>  The great fire which occurred in the Tower in 1841,
and consumed Charles II.'s barracks and storehouse,
together with a quantity of modern arms, which were
kept in the latter building, gave an opportunity to the
Duke of Wellington, who was then Constable, to urge in
the strongest manner upon the Government the necessity
of constructing a suitable barrack for the troops in garrison, and at the same time of commencing the restoration both of the inner and outer defences and walls of
the Tower.
  </p><p>  The dilapidation of the Tower of London, as well
as the confusion of the records and papers in the Constable's charge, had long been a matter of concern to the
Duke, as likewise the unquestionable fact, that the troops
stationed in the Tower were much more unhealthy than
in any other of the London barracks and quarters. For
these reasons, upon the office of Lieut.-Governor falling
vacant, he selected the late Sir George (then Colonel)
Cathcart, an officer of distinguished talent and merit, and
an able man of business, to fill this post, and carry out the
improvements he had designed. On careful investigation
of the causes of ill-health in the garrison, Colonel Cathcart
came to the conclusion, that the mud and stagnant water
of the ditch must be the primary mischief, and suggested
a project for draining it and converting it for the future
into a dry ditch.  This scheme was carried out, and
answered so well, that this Garrison is now considered as



  <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>

healthy as any of the Barracks in London, and the western
portion of the ditch, instead of being a nuisance, affords
a dry, gravelled parade, commonly used as an exercising
ground for the garrison, as well as for several neighbouring Volunteer corps, who are permitted to drill there,
on application to the Lieut.-Governor.
 </p><p>   At the Duke's urgent suggestion, it was determined
by the Government to insert annually in the Parliamentary
Estimates a certain sum to be expended, under superintendence of the Engineer department, for the gradual
restoration of the Tower walls and Bastions.  During
several years this plan was successfully executed, nor was
a voice raised in the House of Commons to oppose
an expenditure due to the credit of the nation, as well
as a wise and needful precaution for the security of
valuable national property.  However, in the year 1852,
a sudden stop was put by the Government to any
further repair of the Tower defences, just as the western
and northern ramparts had been completed, leaving the
whole eastern front in the same ruinous and dilapidated
condition as before.  But the evil did not end here;
advantage was taken of supposed exigencies of the
Crimean war by the Secretary for War at the time, to
order the construction of extensive stores on the very
localities where the further restorations were to have
taken place, even filling the dry ditch with accumulations
of condemned stores, in the teeth of the protest of Lord
Combermere, who had succeeded the late Duke of
Wellington as Constable of the Tower. The enormous
and ill-managed expenses of the war were still held out as





<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>
reasons against the resumption of the works, and the
dilapidation was becoming worse and worse till 1862,
when the Right Honourable F. Lewis, the Secretary for
War, resolved, after a careful personal inspection, to
bring forward in his estimates the sum necessary for continuing the eastern defences. On Mr. Lewis's lamented
death Earl de Grey took up the matter with his usual
ability, and under the able direction of Colonel Nicholson great progress has been made in the rampart, which
is casemated, in accordance with a characteristic elevation furnished by Mr. Salvin, while the parapet is
"arcaded" in the same style, to protect troops from any
musketry fire from the lofty warehouses of St. Katherine's
Docks. The precaution no doubt is judicious, though,
as the late Duke of Wellington remarked on occasion
of his last inspection of the Tower, a few heavy roundshot directed at the foot of St. Katherine's wall from
the guns on the rampart would very soon induce any
venturous rioters who might have occupied the roof, to
abandon a post exposed to the risk of the whole building
falling about their ears.
  </p><p>  Now, as regards the question of the restorations
and repairs lately carried on within the Tower, it
may be asked why should so much difficulty attend
them ?  It is a matter which requires explanation, if
only to defend the Constable and his officers from the
charge of negligence. Unfortunately the authorities of
the Tower have, of themselves, no power to order the
most common repairs; and it is only by persevering
application to different Government offices that the



     <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>

most trifling restorations can be effected.  For what
concerns the "Palatial" portions of the Tower, such as
the Jewel Repository, the two Chapels, the Governor's
residence, and the Quarters of the Warders, application is annually made to the Chief Commissioner of
Works, for the proposed repairs or restorations to be
inserted in the Estimates, and laid before the House of
Commons.    By his directions (if he approves what is
proposed) a survey is first made of the work, and
an estimate goes forward to the Treasury; but here,
unfortunately, it too frequently comes to an untimely
end; because the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if
pressed for other public works, or desirous of coming
to Parliament with low Estimates, has the discretionary
power of striking his pen through any item in the Tower
estimates, however strongly urged upon his notice. Yet
it is evident that he cannot be so well informed of
the details of such subjects as either the Tower authorities or the Office of Works; and the worst part of
the arrangement is, that, by this clumsy routine, many
repairs, which would cost very little if done in proper
time, become doubly expensive, when allowed to stand
over till time and weather have aggravated the dilapidation.
 </p><p>   With regard to the military portions of the Tower,
such as the ramparts, ditches, guns, storehouses, barracks,
hospital, magazines, fire-engines, &amp;c., applications must
be made by the Tower authorities to the Secretary of State
for War, and are referred by him for the opinion of the
Commanding Engineer.






<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>

 </p><p>   It is on the recommendation of the Commanding
Engineer that the Secretary for War enters in the Estimates he prepares for the House of Commons any works
or repairs proposed. But here again the Chancellor of
the Exchequer can put his veto in action, and the works
in question being out of the public view, and not likely to
draw attention like improvements in the Barracks, Parks,
or Public offices at the west end of London, are too
often set aside in favour of other buildings more likely to
attract public notice. Thus the eastern walls and rampart
of the Tower, facing St. Katherine's, have only lately been
approved in the Estimates, having lain for above ten
years in a state of ruin and decay disgraceful to public
buildings of any kind, but especially to the most venerable
and historical fortress of Great Britain.
   </p><p> One great difficulty which the Constable and his
officers had formerly to contend with, was the absence
of anything like good taste, or appreciation of a suitable
style of architecture, on the part of the old Board of
Ordnance, as regarded the restoration or construction
of military buildings: witness the monstrous Warehouses
and Store-offices which disfigure the river front of the
Tower, and to which, so late as in 1852, an upper story
was added, in the decorative style of the great gin-palaces
of London.
  </p><p>  A different and more judicious course is now followed, and reference is made to Mr. Salvin, the
celebrated castle architect, as well as to the Commanding Engineer, when it is a question of restoration or improvement of the Walls, Barracks, and



   <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>

Storehouses in the Tower.  With no greater expense
than was formerly thrown away on absurd modern
decoration, the buildings are now treated with due reference to the ancient style of the Tower.  A general
principle has lately been introduced by Mr. Salvin in
making a distinction between the exterior style of building connected with the walls and defences, and the
interior edifices of the Tower. According to this principle, the latter should have no defensive character about
them, but their fronts and roofs should resemble the
common street architecture in London before the Great
Fire of 1666. Those readers who happen to be familiar
with the appearance of the old parts of the city of
Chester, will readily understand the style considered suitable for the interior buildings in the Tower.
   </p><p> The walls and outer defences must of course partake
of a military character, though it has been shown, by the
effect of the new Rampart and Casemates to the eastward, that it is perfectly possible to combine the requisites of fortification, with the style appropriate to so
ancient and historical a pile as the venerable Tower of
London.
  </p><p>   With deep respect for the memory of one who never
meddled but to amend or to improve, it may here be
observed that the late Prince Consort, by his discreet
intervention on the part of The Queen, in reference to
those portions of the Tower which were dependencies
of the ancient Palace, first established a proper system
of control over the architecture of the Tower, by declaring it to be Her Majesty's pleasure that " no edifice





<pb id="p.20" n="20"/>

within its walls should be built, altered, or restored, until
the plans and elevations should have been officially submitted for her Majesty's personal approval"-a regulation
which is now strictly attended to, and which has produced
already some very satisfactory results.</p>

          <p>THE chapel of St. John, in the upper story of
            the White Tower, was, until a very few years
            back, most improperly used as a repository
            for obsolete records.  On the erection of
the General Record Office in Lincoln's Inn, in the year
1857, the whole of the State Papers were cleared out from
this and other parts of the Tower, and removed to the
new establishment. It will scarcely be believed that an
attempt was made, on that occasion, to take possession
of this ancient and historical chapel, as a clothing store
for the War Department, and in spite of the remonstrances
of Lord Combermere (then Constable), this appropriation
would have taken place, but for a change of Government,
which occurred within a few days after the order had
been issued. General Peel then came into office, and,
admitting the propriety of the Constable's objection, saved
the Chapel from further desecration. As part of the royal
palace, it was at once put in charge of the Office of Works;
and when the Hon. W. Cowper became First Commissioner, a complete restoration was undertaken under his
auspices by Mr. Salvin, who carried it out with his usual




<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>

taste and judgment. Perhaps there is nowhere, certainly
not in England, a more noble and striking specimen of the
grand and simple style of Norman architecture than this
Chapel, as now restored. The massive and solemn effect
of its huge columns, and the absence of all minor decorations and ornament, give a peculiar character and dignity
to its imposing architecture. It is associated with many
interesting historical recollections. Here it was that the
forty-six noblemen and gentlemen, created Knights of
the Bath by Henry IV., on his accession to the throne,
performed the ancient chivalrous ceremony of watching
their armour from sunset to sunrise. Brackenbury was
at his prayers in this Chapel when he received Richard's
message to destroy Edward V. and his brother, which
execrable deed he, to his honour, refused to undertake.
Here the mortal remains of Queen Elizabeth, the White
Rose of York, lay in state for some weeks, previous to
her splendid funeral in 1503.
  </p><p>   The floor or body of St. John's Chapel is on the
same level as the Banqueting-hall, which occupies
the main story of the White Tower, while the gallery,
which runs round three sides of the Chapel, is entered
from the Council Chamber, without communication from
below. The Royal Palace, of which there is scarcely
any vestige remaining, communicated with the White
Tower, and this gallery was probably the place to which
the English queens and their ladies resorted for the celebration of mass, unseen by the congregation in the body
of the Chapel below.

<p>Chapel by the outward turret stair (at the foot of which
the bones of the murdered princes were found in Charles
II.'s time), and so through the armouries to the main
stairs, by which the White Tower is entered.
  </p><p>  Among the curious traditions of the White Tower, it






<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>

is said, that in the time of the civil wars a Parliamentary
soldier was pursuing a Royalist, sword in hand, up the
north stairs, when the latter, finding escape impossible
by further flight, suddenly dropped on his knees at the
landing-place, close to a window, which has a very low
sill, and tripping up his pursuer by the heels, pitched him
headlong down into the yard beneath, and broke his
neck by the fall.
  </p><p>   The underground part of the White Tower was used
for confinement of such prisoners as were to be deprived
of all indulgence, and contained dungeons of the most
gloomy description. These have been mostly cleared
away and removed, in making room for the extensive
stores of iron bedsteads, and other barrack furniture,
which used to be accumulated here by the store depot;
but at the south-east angle of these vaults, there still exists
a dark cell, closed by a heavy door, with no aperture
for the admission of either light or air, and known by
the ominous name of "Little Ease."  In this cell Guy
Fawkes was confined, previous to his examination and
torture, which took place in the Governor's house, in
presence of the Lords of the Council, of which particulars are given in another place. There has been lately
discovered in the vaults of the White Tower another
cell, with this inscription:-
                 <quote rend="blockquote">Sacris vestibus indutus
                 <lb/>dum sacra mysteria
                 <lb/>servans, captus et in
                 <lb/>hoc angusto carcere
                 <lb/>inclusus. R. FISHER.</quote>



     <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>

  </p><p>  Somewhere also in the vaults of the White Tower was
the cell mentioned in several of the records as " Cold
Harbour," a denomination which has given rise to much
discussion, from its having been applied, not only to
places of confinement, but to several hamlets in different
counties of England, without any apparent similarity of
meaning. It is said that there are to be found in old
English maps and itineraries, as many as fifteen or
twenty " Cold Harbours," but whether they were places
of confinement, it is vain now to conjecture.  It has
been remarked, as somewhat peculiar in the construction of the White Tower, that there is but one portion
(that which supports the enormous weight of St. John's
Chapel) which is vaulted. The floors of the Banqueting-hall and the Council-chamber are laid on huge oak joists,
placed at very close intervals, and so strong and solid
are they, that not the smallest deflection has ever been
perceived in them, though, at one time, the weight of the
stores placed on the floors which they supported, must
have tested them severely. In Mr. Salvin's able restoration
of this part of the Tower, an open space for admission
of light from the council-chamber to the banqueting-
hall beneath it has been judiciously left open in the
flooring, exactly in its original state, in order to show
the great size and perfect preservation of the ancient
oak joists above mentioned. Round the whole of the
council-chamber, a sort of gallery or corridor is cut in
the thickness of the wall, which accords with the details
of Shakespeare's celebrated scene of the Protector's sudden

Hastings was hurried down into the court below, and,

  </p><p>   One of the turrets on the corners of the roof of the
White Tower is supposed to have been the scene of the
imprisonment and murder of the unfortunate Matilda
Fitz Walter, called Matilda the Fair, from her remarkable
beauty.  "About the year 1215," saith the Book of
Dunmow, "there arose a great discord between King
John and his barons, because of Matilda, surnamed the
Fair, daughter of Robert Lord Fitz Walter, whom the
King loved, but could not obtain her, nor her father's
consent. Whereupon the King banished the said Fitz
Walter, the most valiant Knight in England, and caused
his Castle in London, called 'Baynard's,' and all his
other dwellings, to be spoiled; which being done, he sent
to Matilda about his old suit in love, and because she
would not agree, the messenger poisoned an egg, and
bade her keepers, when she was hungry, boil it, and give
her to eat. She did so, and died."
  </p><p>   Miss Strickland, in one of her most interesting Royal
Lives, that of Isabella of Angouleme, observes, in speaking of the unhappy fate of Matilda Fitz Walter, " The






  <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>

abduction of this lady, who, to do her justice, thoroughly
abhorred the royal felon, was the exploit which completed
the exasperation of the English barons, who flew to
arms, for the purpose of avenging the honour of the most
distinguished among their class, Lord Fitz Walter."
  </p><p>  The White Tower, like other parts of the Tower of
London, has been subjected to much modern disfigurement. Even the eminent Sir Christopher Wren so entirely
lost sight of architectural propriety in his restoration and
repair of the White Tower, that he faced the windows
with stone in the Italian style, and so disfigured this
venerable building, that, until the stranger has entered
within its massive walls, and observed their huge thickness and other evidence of its antiquity, he might suppose
the White Tower to date no farther back than the time
of Queen Anne or George I.

   <p> THE chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula, situated
            at the north end of the fatal "Tower
            Green," where Anne Boleyn, and so many
            royal and illustrious persons, suffered under
the stroke of the executioner, is a building of ancient
date, but not remarkable for any architectural merit,
beyond that of simplicity, and a certain justice of
proportions which is always pleasing to the eye.  It
is inconceivable what pains have been taken, in comparatively modern times, to disfigure this interesting
chapel. During the reign of George II. directions were
given to adapt it for the reception of the troops for Divine
Service, when, instead of the obvious expedient of throwing
out a gallery or clerestory, on the north side and exterior
to the main wall, the interior of the Chapel was defaced
and encumbered by a projecting gallery along the north
and west sides, such as may be seen in the worst style
of country church of the last century. The handsome
old doorway to the west was built up, and a brick and
plaster porch was thrown out from the south front, for the
entrance to the body of the Chapel. From this porch
was carried up a narrow and inconvenient wooden

<figure id="Fig.011" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00011"><head>Interior of St. Peter's ad Vincula, in the Tower, 1866</head></figure>

        <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>

staircase, giving access to the west end of the soldiers'
gallery.
  </p><p>  In the year 1862 the old doorway was accidentally
discovered concealed by a thick coat of plaster, and on
the late Constable's representation, the First Commissioner of Works sanctioned its restoration, and the removal of the unsightly porch and staircase on the south
side.  One or two modern tablets which had been
awkwardly fixed up across part of the windows were
shifted, and an inspection being made of the ancient
roof, by removal of the plaster over the chancel, brought
to view the original woodwork, which was not in a bad
condition. The whole of the ceiling was then carefully
removed, and the woodwork of the roof now appears as
originally intended by the architect. Near the Communion table there are two curious monuments of the
Blounts, father and son, who were both Lieutenants of
the Tower, and one of Sir Richard Cholmondeley and
the Lady Elizabeth his wife, at the north-west corner
of the Chapel.  But the chief interest of St. Peter's
Chapel consists in the number of royal and illustrious
persons whose corpses lie buried beneath its pavement.

<p>     Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, the leading actor
in Henry VIII.'s suppression of papal supremacy.
  </p><p>   In Edward VI.'s reign was buried here, after decapitation, Thomas Seymour, the Lord Admiral, brother
of the Protector Somerset. The Protector himself fell
a victim soon after to the combination of his enemies,
and was buried by the side of his brother.
  </p><p>   In Mary's reign this Chapel received the headless
bodies of Lady Jane Grey and her husband Lord Guildford Dudley.
  </p><p>   In Elizabeth's reign, Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk; Devereux, Earl of Essex, and other nobles were
here interred after execution.
 </p><p>    In James I.'s reign, Sir W. Raleigh here found rest
after his life of vicissitude and trouble. There also lies
among these noble persons, the body of Sir Gervase
Elways, a man whose infamy should have excluded him
from a spot where so many eminent persons found their
last repose. This wretch, who had borne an active part
in the poisoning of Overbury, was allowed his last request
of being buried in St. Peter's Chapel, after being hanged
on Tower Hill instead of Tyburn, a favour granted to his
earnest entreaty, and to which in his dying speech he
alluded with a singular satisfaction.
 </p><p>   A visit to St. Peter's Chapel is recorded by Pepys in
his 'Diary' with much complacency:-



<pb id="p.31" n="31"/>

   </p><p> "Lord's day, Feb. 28, 1663-4. The Lieutenant of the
Tower, Sir J. Robinson, would needs have me by coach
home with him, where the officers of his regiment (? of
the Tower) dined with him. After dinner to chapel in
the Tower with the Lieutenant, with the keys carried
before us, and the Warders and Gentlemen porters going
before us; and I sat with the Lieutenant in his pew, in
great state. None, it seems, of the prisoners in the
Tower that are there now (though they may) will come
to prayers there."
  </p><p>  In the vestry of St. Peter's Chapel may be seen the
three leaden coffin-plates of the Scotch lords Kilmarnock,
Balmerino, and Lovat (beheaded in 1746, and interred
within the Tower). After the great fire in the Tower of
1841, some excavations were found necessary to obtain
a solid foundation for the present Barracks, when a great
number of old coffins were, with a vast quantity of bones,
removed into the vaults on the north side of the Chapel.
On that occasion these coffin-plates were discovered,
and placed in the vestry, where they are carefully preserved in glass frames.
   </p><p>  Against the south wall of the Chapel is affixed a small
rough tablet, rescued from among a heap of rubbish
when the pavement of the Chapel was repaired, about
1852. It records the burial of Talbot Edwards, the brave
old guardian of the Regalia, at the time of the desperate
attempt of the notorious Blood to carry off the crown,
of which an account will be given in another place.
   </p><p>  Plans have lately been submitted for the removal
 of the modern gallery, occupied by the troops, when







<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>

attending Divine Service, and for converting the close
pews into open seats; and, as this would be a work of
no great expense, it may be hoped that, at no distant
period, so manifest an improvement may be carried out.
   </p><p>  The public take more interest daily in the Tower of
London; and the best proof that the restorations effected
within the last ten years have given general satisfaction,
is the great increase in the receipts for admission tickets
at the gate. When restorations and improvements of any
ancient and historical building are properly explained, the
House of Commons is not disposed to be illiberal, but
the difficulty generally arises from the desire on the
part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to cut down the
public expenditure in every branch which does not come
prominently before the public observation.</p>

<p>
         IN the early troubles of Richard II.'s reign
           the Tower was his chief residence, and on
           more than one occasion proved his safest
           protection against the London mob.   It
was from the Tower stairs that the young King embarked when he first attempted, from his barge on the
Thames, to pacify the armed crowds which had assembled
on the shore at Rotherhithe. But the tumult overpowered
his endeavours to address them, and he had no option
but to return to the Tower. The excited mob followed
him along the bank, and, crossing the bridge, occupied
the ground about St. Katherine's, "hooting," as Froissart
tells us, "as loud as if the very devils were in them."
   </p><p>  The gallant Mayor, Walworth, who was in the fortress
with the King, proposed to make a sally at night, when
most of the mob would be drunk; but other advisers induced the King to attempt a further parley, and to meet
the leaders at Mile-end, in order to hear their grievances.
Scarcely had he passed out of the gate, when a party of
rebels placed in ambush made a rush and burst into the
Tower. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Sir R. Hales,
and other knights, betook themselves to the Sanctuary of


<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>

St. Peter, but were torn from the very altar, and their
heads struck off upon the spot, after which great plunder
was committed, and the King's mother, the widow of the
Black Prince, treated with insolence and brutality. Historians have given detailed accounts of the result of the
young King's spirited behaviour, after Walworth had
struck down Wat Tyler; and there is the following quaint
narrative of what passed afterwards, in the ' Chronicle of
London:'-
 </p><p>   " And on the morrow after, that is to saye Fryday,
and than on the Satirday after Corpus Christ.-day, the Kyng
anon after, rood into Smythfield, and Willm. Walworth,
than beinge Maire of London, Sir Robert Knollys, and
Aldermenne, and other citezeins with hym ; and there they
metten with Jake Straw, leder of the uprysers; and this
Jake Strawe spak to the Kyng hoded, as it hadde bene
to his fellawe; and John Blyton that bar the Maire's
swerd, bad him don his hodde, while he spak to the
Kyng; whereat Jack Strawe wax angred and mynte to
caste his dagger at Blyton. And than Wm. Walworth
drewe his 'baselard' and smote Jack Strawe on his hed;
and with that Rauf Standyshe, that bar the King's swerd,
roof Jack Straw through his bodye, and there he fel down
ded."
 </p><p> At a later period (1387) Richard had to seek safety
again within the Tower walls, from his uncle the Duke of
Gloucester and the Barons, whom his recklessness and
misgovernment had exasperated against him. The Duke
of Ireland marched a force to his assistance, while the
Barons drew near London with 40,000 men. The Duke


         <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>

secretly sent three of his knights into the city, to test the
temper of the citizens. They quitted their horses and
followers at Kennington, and, taking boat near Vauxhall,
were rowed down to the Tower, and entered by the watergate unobserved by the rebels. But learning from the
Governor, the strong animosity of the citizens of London
against Richard, they withdrew, as privately as they had
come. The Duke of Ireland was attacked and defeated,
and the King besieged again in the Tower, where a parley
having been held with the rebel leader in the council-room,
the King found himself obliged to accept their terms, and
to submit to the sorrow and humiliation of giving up Sir
Simon Burley, his oldest and most devoted adherent, to
the vengeance of Gloucester and Arundel.
  </p><p>   This noble veteran of Edward III.'s wars, who had
been placed about Richard's person by the Black Prince,
as his governor and tutor, was beheaded on Tower Hill,
though the "good Queen Anne" fell on her knees in
tears before Gloucester, to obtain his life.
   </p><p>  Richard never forgave this outrage; and when Gloucester's party were afterwards overthrown, the death of
 Burley was one of the chief reasons which led him to take
 so terrible a revenge on Gloucester, by causing him to be
 secretly put to death in prison in the Castle of Calais.
 Richard II. also seized his leading adherents, the Earls
 of Arundel and Warwick, and both were condemned
 to die as traitors.  Arundel was beheaded in Cheapside, where he was led from the Tower; but so much
 intercession was made for Warwick, on account of his
 former military services in France, that Richard spared







<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>
his life, on the condition (a very curious one it appears in
these days) that he should go into perpetual exile in the
Isle of Wight; an island, observes Froissart, in his narrative of these events, "where there is room enough for a
great nobleman's establishment, only he must take with
him every kind of provision and furniture, or he would
find himself under much discomfort!"
  </p><p>  But Richard's prosperity was of short duration.
Henry of Bolingbroke raised an army against him, and
after various successes made him prisoner and lodged
him in the Tower, where, with a barbarous refinement
of cruelty, four or five of his most faithful adherents,
accused of having been concerned in the death of Gloucester, were brought under the window of the King's
prison, tied to horses' tails, and dragged through the
streets to Cheapside, there to suffer an ignominious
death. After this humiliation, Richard was compelled to
go through a formal ceremony in the Council-chamber of
the White Tower, of resigning his crown and sceptre to
the Usurper. He was kept close prisoner during the
magnificent pageant of Henry IV.'s coronation, when an
attempt at a rising having been prematurely made by
some who still adhered to him, he was removed to Leeds
Castle, and thence to Pomfret, where, according to
Hollingshed, he was murdered.  Froissart's version is,
however, different, for he states that he perished "somehow " in the Tower. His remains however were, as both
agree, eventually conveyed from the Tower, in a procession
to St. Paul's Cathedral, "where he lay," says Froissart,
"his head on a black cushion, and his visage open to view.


        <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>


Some had pity on him, and some had none, but said he
had long ago deserved his death." He was carried to
Langley and there buried, but his corpse was afterwards
removed to Westminster Abbey.

Richard and his unhappy queen was doubtless drawn

          <p>THE Battle of Agincourt, that extraordinary
            victory, gained, against all the usual chances
            of war, by the cool and deliberate courage
            which has been from the earliest times the
characteristic quality of English troops, filled the Tower
with illustrious and noble prisoners.
  </p><p>  The Chivalry of the times, though it led the captors
to spare the lives of persons of birth and quality, did not
prevent them from taking every possible pecuniary advantage of the unhappy position of their prisoners. The
personal captivity of a great landed proprietor was consequently a cause of the utmost distress, and damage, to
his estates and family. Too often it occurred, that the
neighbour encroached; the tenants eluded the payment
of their rents and services; the stewards, and all concerned in the property, took advantage of their master's
absence; and, worst of all, his feudal chief, or sovereign,
frequently increased the evil by his extortions, instead of
acting as a protector to the family and estates of the
captive vassal.
  </p><p>   Though Henry V. probably treated his noble prisoners

<figure id="Fig.015" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00015"><head>The Tower in the Fifteenth Century</head></figure>

         <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>

of Agincourt with as much courtesy and regard as
was customary at the time, yet he was not a man to scruple
at screwing out the utmost amount of ransom which a
prisoner of distinction could produce, by heavy impositions on his vassals.  Shakespeare's graphic dialogue
between Henry V. and the royal herald on the field of
battle shows the prodigious number of the French nobility
that fell into his hands by that memorable victory:-
</p><p>
 <quote rend="blockquote"> " King Hen.: What prisoners of good sort are taken ?
  Exeter.: Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the King;
John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Boucicault.
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
Full fifteen hundred."</quote> <note place="foot" n="1">HENRY V., act iv. scene 8.</note>

</p><p>We find from various authorities, that although these
illustrious personages were, in the first instance, treated
with the respect due to their rank and misfortunes,
yet after time had been allowed them  for free communication with their families and territories, in order
to collect the vast sums demanded for their liberty, restrictions and hardships were imposed by their captor, as
a means of inducing more prompt and effective measures
on the part of their friends and dependants for collecting
their ransoms. That of Charles of Orleans (who before
his capture had the ill fortune to be grievously wounded
in the battle) was fixed at an enormous sum, equal to
about 500,000L. of our present money; and his noble companions the Dukes of Bourbon and Boucicault died in




<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>
the Tower, while vainly awaiting the collection in France
of equally large ransoms, levied with much delay and
difficulty, on the inhabitants of their exhausted and ruined
lands.
 </p><p>   It was this Charles of Orleans who, a very few years
after the murder of Richard II., married his young widow,
Isabella, who had been sent back to France by Bolinbroke. Perhaps there is not in all his plays a more
beautiful and touching scene than that in which Shakespeare describes the parting of Richard with his young
queen. Isabella did not long survive her marriage to
Charles of Orleans, who deeply lamented her death, little
aware of the wretched existence which awaited her, had
she survived to bewail the long and sad captivity in which
he afterwards languished in the Tower, till his ransom was
at length paid in the year 1440, after an imprisonment
of twenty-five years, the greater part of which was of
a rigorous nature, though relaxed a few years before his
release.</p>

         <p>ONE of the most terrible mysteries of the
           Tower is the question how Richard III.
           disposed of his unfortunate nephews, after
           consigning them to that imprisonment, from
which they never issued alive.
  </p><p>  Taking the tradition as generally received, Richard,
after giving all the necessary orders for the ceremony of
his nephew's coronation (there is evidence that even his
robes were prepared), somewhat suddenly declared his
intention of seizing the crown, and caused the Lieutenant
of the Tower, Sir Robert Brackenbury, to be sounded,
as to whether he would undertake to make away with the
young King and his brother. Brackenbury is said to have
received Richard's message while kneeling at his devo-.
tions in St. John's Chapel, in the White Tower, and to
have rejected so dreadful a task.  Richard, in consequence of his refusal, gave authority to James Tyrrell to
receive from Brackenbury the temporary charge of the
Tower and the prisoners within its walls. This being
arranged, Tyrrell employed Dighton and Forest, two unscrupulous assassins, to take the lives of the royal children,
which was accomplished by smothering them with the







<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>
pillows of their bed. Their bodies were then buried
within the Tower, nor does it appear that Richard ever
at any time alluded to them afterwards, or attempted to
account for their disappearance. There was no announcement of their illness, or of their death from natural causes,
no ceremony of a funeral, or any further public notice of
the fate of the princes.
  </p><p>  The appearance at the court of Burgundy, some years
afterwards (1492), of the youth who assumed the name of
the Duke of York, was the first we hear of the matter
from the time of the supposed murder. But though there
have been many details handed down by contemporaries
and writers who lived no long time after these occurrences, history affords no circumstantial narrative or
relation, to show by what means, or by whose assistance,
the pretended Duke of York had avoided his brother's
fate, and contrived to escape from the Tower and elude
the vigilance of his uncle by flight beyond sea. Was
Richard a man to neglect any act of caution, or to shrink
from any violence in regard to the custody, or in respect
to the escape of such a prisoner as the Duke of York?
and could it be effected by a boy of such tender years
without powerful aid, and the concurrence of a considerable number of influential persons ? But if the impostor
really was the Duke, what had become of his elder brother? Did those who managed to save the younger
make no attempt to rescue the elder and more important
victim ? If Edward was not murdered, what became of
him ? Had he died a natural death, would not Richard
have given it every notoriety ? Would he not have exposed



    <pb id="p.43" n="43"/>

the body to public view, as was done in the case of
Henry VI. ? and would he not by a public funeral, and by
other marks of respect, have tried to convince the world
that there had been no foul play, or, at all events, that
he had had no hand in the disappearance of Edward V. ?
  </p><p>  Again, why is there no record of the existence of
Edward V. as a prisoner in the Tower, from the momen
when Richard usurped the crown? Up to that time we
find his uncle's orders for his clothing and provisions on a
scale to be expected for the maintenance of a Royal Personage. It has been asked, why should the Duchess of
Burgundy, Edward IV.'s sister, have acknowledged Perkin
Warbeck as her nephew, if she had any doubt of his identity ? Now, supposing her to have been really deceived by
his plausible tale, how little opportunity could she have had,
in those times, of a thorough scrutiny into events, which
it was Richard's whole object to veil in mystery and
darkness, and over which his assumption of the regal
power gave him a control, amply sufficient to defeat any
attempt of a foreign princess to investigate the facts. On
the other hand, her personal aversion to Henry, the
political state of Europe, and the scanty communication
between Burgundy and England, would account for her
more readily adopting the imposture, and doing all in
her power to damage the character of the King, and
his title to the crown.
 </p><p>    As the murder of the Princes has been called in question, so the localities attributed to its perpetration have
 been disputed on various grounds. A small chamber in
 the Bloody Tower has, by long tradition, been assigned







<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>
as the spot where the barbarous deed was done; and
notwithstanding the professed doubts of Bailey and other
writers, no more probable or likely place has been named.
We know that this chamber was closely adjoining to the
Governor's house, where so many prisoners of rank have
been confined, when security, rather than severity of
imprisonment, was the object in view. Indeed, in the
older accounts of the buildings within the fortress, we
frequently find it called the Garden Tower, from its
adjoining the Governor's private garden. It is remarkable that, in a complimentary oration in Latin (still in
preservation), with which the authorities of the Tower
received James I. at the gate, on his first visit to the
fortress after his accession, express mention is made of
the " Bloody Tower," as the scene of the Princes' murder.
  </p><p>   Now this visit of James I. took place within 120 years
of the usurpation of Richard; and there could be no
necessity, or even plausible reason, for alluding to it in
the Latin ' Oration' above mentioned, had it not been a
matter of common belief and notoriety, that the Bloody
Tower was the scene of the murder, and that a description of the principal features of the Tower by the orator,
would have been incomplete without such notice of the
fact.
  </p><p>   It was always a sequel to the tradition of the murder
of the Princes, that " the priest of the Tower " had buried
their bodies in some concealed place (Shakespeare puts
this fact in the mouth of Tyrrell); and surely it was not
unreasonable to infer, when two children's bodies, corresponding in age, and period of decay, with the date of the




     <pb id="p.45" n="45"/>


murder, were discovered in Charles II.'s time, by some
workmen, at the foot of a staircase, about seventy yards
distant from the Bloody Tower, that these were the bones
of the Princes. There were two consecrated burial-grounds
within the Tower, besides that of Barking Church on
Tower Hill, close by; and what likelihood was there,</p>

<p><figure id="Fig.018" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00018"><head>
THE BLOODY TOWER.</head></figure></p>
<p>
 under those circumstances, of two boys being buried in
 this sequestered nook, under a staircase, unless with a
 view to secrecy and concealment ? Again, had the bones




<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>

been those of grown persons, it might be conjectured
that two unfortunate prisoners had been quietly made
away with in those disturbed times, and buried in secret,
but there is no probable cause for this having occurred in
respect to two boys, even if there were traces or records
of any other youthful prisoners, except Edward V. and
his brother, having been in the Tower at all.
  </p><p>  Charles II. was by no means of a credulous nature;
very much the reverse; and he had, moreover, a considerable turn for investigation, and took much interest
in all matters of history. His adoption, therefore, of the
tradition of the murder of the Princes, as commonly
accepted at the time, must surely be regarded as a strong
confirmation of the story.
  </p><p>  Had not Charles been fully convinced that these
bones were those of the princes, why should he have gone
to the trouble and expense of transferring them, with all
the respect paid to Royal remains, to the vaults of Westminster Abbey? There could be no political or public
reason for his doing so; and we must in fairness, therefore, attribute it to his conviction, that he was paying
the respect due to the remains of these victims of
cruelty and ambition, by consigning their bodies to the
resting-place of their royal ancestors.
  </p><p>  It was by Charles II.'s orders, as the tradition went,
that Sir Thomas Chicheley, his Master-General of the
Ordnance, planted a mulberry-tree on the spot where
the Princes' bodies were found; but with a vandalism to
which the Tower has too often been subjected, a staircase
was built up in 1674 against the wall, which caused the

<figure id="Fig.019" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00019"><head>Landing-Place on Stairs, White Tower.</head></figure>

    <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>

rapid decay of the mulberry-tree. There was, however, in
1853, an old Warder who well recollected to have seen the
stump still imbedded in the landing of the stairs. If
the tale be true that Richard ordered their burial in consecrated ground, it accounts for their being laid here, because
the stairs-leading up to St. John's Chapel would be considered as under the same consecration as the chapel itself.
  </p><p>   Miss Strickland, with her usual research and accuracy, has traced out the very important details of the vast
rewards bestowed by Richard on Tyrrell and his assistants
in the murder. Tyrrell was made Captain or Governor of
the town of Guisnes, near Calais, and further received
three rich stewardships from Richard, in the Marches of
Wales. Dighton was made Bailiff of the town of Ayton,
with a pension. Green was named to the Receivership of
the Isle of Wight. Forrest's widow had a pension given her
on his death, shortly after the murder; and ample general
pardons were granted to them, whatever villanies might be
laid to their charge; all under the royal hand and seal, not
naming for what offence, but covering any, and all. Sir
James Tyrrell, according to Miss Strickland's investigation, actually confessed the murder, just before he was
beheaded by order of Henry VII., in 1502, for favouring
the escape of John de la Pole, on whom his uncle Richard
had settled the succession to the crown. Dighton also
confessed his part in the murder, when hanged at Calais,
soon after Tyrrell's execution; and at the same time declared his knowledge of the old priest having buried the
bodies, first under the Wakefield Tower, and a second
time in some place of which he had no knowledge.</p>

<p>       FROM    the time of Henry II.'s conquest of
            Ireland disturbances had never ceased to
            prevail in that country, arising partly from
            the impatience with which the native Irish
submitted to their rulers, and partly from the dissensions constantly occurring among those rulers themselves.
The most powerful of the Norman Lords of the Pale,
the Earls of Kildare, of Desmond, and of Ormonde,
were a constant cause of anxiety to the English Government. In Henry VII.'s reign Gerald Earl of Kildare
(Mr. Froude erroneously calls him  Thomas) warmly
espoused the cause of the two successive pretenders,
Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck, and, raising a body
of troops, carried fire and sword through the Pale, till the
able Sir E. Poynings was sent over as Chief Governor,
who succeeded in defeating the Earl of Kildare, and
making him prisoner. Uncivilized and brutal as were
these half Norman and half Irish nobles, they appear to
have possessed a large share of ready wit, and a freedom
and chivalry of address, which stood them in good stead
when summoned to London to answer for their misdeeds.
Gerald, the eighth earl, when brought before the King




   <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

and Council, was warned by Henry himself that great
crimes were alleged against him, but that he should have
a fair trial, and might choose some fit person to plead for
him. He answered boldly, "I will choose the ablest
in England, for I will take your Highness yourself for my
counsel against these false knaves."
  </p><p>  In the course of the trial it was laid to Gerald's
charge that he had burned the cathedral of Cashel. The
Earl did not attempt to deny the fact, but contented
himself with declaring, as his defence, that he would never
have set fire to the cathedral had he not been assured
that the Archbishop was inside of it. This extraordinary
plea so amused the King and his Council, that upon
one of them observing, "All Ireland could not govern
this Earl," the King replied, "This Earl shall govern
all Ireland."
  </p><p>   So fully did Gerald acquit himself of the charges of
treason, and succeed in gaining Henry VII.'s good graces,
that he returned to Ireland a Knight of the Garter, and
with Elizabeth the daughter of Oliver St. John (a gentleman high in the royal favour) for his wife. Although he
ruled over the country with a hand of iron, and little
regard to justice or law, yet he maintained a tolerable
condition of order; and the Lords of the Pale, as well as
the Irish, were kept in a comparatively peaceable state
till his death, in 1513, a period of nearly twenty years.
   </p><p>  His son Gerald, the ninth Earl, was allowed by
 Henry VIII. to succeed his father as Chief Governor;
 but such strong proofs of intended rebellion were brought
 against him, that, in 1520, the Earl of Surrey was sent







<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>
over to supersede him, and transmit him prisoner to
London, where he was lodged in the Tower. However,
by his loyal professions, and the grace and courtesy of his
manners, the Earl contrived so to ingratiate himself with
the King, that, releasing him from prison, Henry took him
in his suite to the Field of the Cloth of Gold, where the
young Irish nobleman gained such applause by his skill in
the tournament, and noble carriage and behaviour, that, on
the King's return to London, he was allowed to become a
suitor of Lady Elizabeth Grey, daughter of the Marquis
of Dorset, and nearly allied to the blood royal, and, after
a short probation, to marry her. Though not immediately restored to the government of Ireland, yet, in
consequence of the alleged misconduct of Ormonde, who
had succeeded Surrey, he was soon after (1524) again
made Governor. It was not long before Henry had
reason to repent his choice, for on the breaking out of
war with France in that year the Earl of Kildare entered
into secret relations with the Earl of Desmond, who had
actually commenced a negotiation with Francis I. for the
invasion of Ireland by a French army. The peace between England and France having put an end to this
project, Kildare opened a similar proposition to the
Emperor Charles V. through the Earl of Desmond, pretending all the while to be at enmity with that Chieftain.
  </p><p>  Again the King's suspicions were excited, and again
was Kildare summoned to London in 1527; but his
sagacity and shrewdness enabled him to clear himself,
and Henry appointed him to act as a sort of adviser
to his natural son the Duke of Richmond, who became




    <pb id="p.51" n="51"/>

Chief Governor; Sir W. Skeffington, a veteran officer in
favour with the King, being appointed to command the
English troops.
  </p><p>  Allen, one of those able men who owed their first
advancement to the discernment of Wolsey, was nominated Archbishop of Dublin, and directed to keep a sharp
watch on Kildare. Meantime the most violent feuds
broke out between the Geraldines and Butlers, while
O'Neill ravaged the province of Ulster.
  </p><p>  In consequence probably of Archbishop Allen's
reports to the King, Kildare was for the third time summoned to London, and, without any form of trial, thrown
into the Tower. The King had got wind of the negotiation with Charles V.; and Pope Clement having proceeded to his sentence of excommunication of Henry,
there was every likelihood of the troubles in Ireland
assuming a religious character.
   </p><p> The son of Kildare, Lord Thomas Fitzgerald, best
known as "Silken Thomas," accompanied his father to
London, but was not imprisoned with him, and shortly
returned to Ireland.  Historians have differed as to
whether it was with his father's sanction or not that
Silken Thomas, on his return, broke out into rebellion.
It is not likely that Kildare would have desired his
son to do that which must imperil his own life; and the
most probable version is, that his son's rash and hopeless
rebellion was not approved or instigated by the Earl.
It is at all events certain that Lord Thomas, breaking
violently into the presence of the Council, seized the sword
of state, and, abjuring all further allegiance to the King,





<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>

dashed it on the table, and, mounting his horse, galloped
off with a large body of his adherents to raise the country
in rebellion.
  </p><p>  At the head of several thousand men he laid siege
to Dublin, and obliged Sir J. White, who commanded
the garrison, to withdraw into the Castle. Archbishop
Allen endeavoured to escape to England in a small vessel,
which, unobserved by the Irish, dropped down the Liffey
to the sea; but, unluckily, the master, being attached to
the Geraldines, ran her on shore at Clontarf, and, sending
a messenger to Dublin, betrayed the unfortunate Archbishop. Silken Thomas rode down to Clontarf with
three of his uncles, and caused him to be dragged from
the pallet where he had lain down, in a small cabin, for
repose; and one of the savage followers of the Geraldine
having struck him on the head as he kneeled for mercy,
he was instantly despatched with numerous wounds, and
his body treated with every indignity.
   </p><p> Although Silken Thomas afterwards attempted to show
that he had had no intention of committing this ruthless
murder, yet all doubt must be removed by the fact of his
having written to boast of the deed, both to the Emperor
and to the Pope.
  </p><p>   The siege of Dublin Castle was now pressed hard;
but Ormonde, with his brave Butlers, made so gallant an
assault on the Geraldine forces that he forced his way
through their lines and relieved White when at the last
extremity.
  </p><p>  Sir W. Skeffington arrived a few days after with a
considerable body of troops from Wales; and though he



    <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>

acted with little decision or promptitude himself, yet his
lieutenant, Sir W. Brereton, entered the Liffey with five
or six hundred men, and at once restored confidence in
Dublin. Silken Thomas withdrew with his troops in confusion into the country; but not finding himself pursued
by Skeffington, who was in a bad state of health, as well
as far advanced in years, made some attempts with
parties of horse to harass the English posts round
Dublin. The inactivity of Skeffington being reported
to Henry, he sent over Lord Leonard Grey, brother to
the Countess of Kildare, to act as marshal of the army.
Roused by the arrival of Lord Leonard, Skeffington
marched upon Maynooth Castle, the stronghold of the
Geraldines, and, besieging it with heavy cannon (supposed to be the first employed in a siege in Ireland),
took the castle by storm, and barbarously hanged the
survivors of the garrison.
  </p><p>   Meantime the news of these proceedings in Ireland,
and the expectation of the King's vengeance, so affected
the unfortunate Earl in his prison, that he expired, after
a short illness, and was buried in the Tower chapel.
Lord Thomas, driven to the last extremities, and deserted
by most of his followers, was induced by Lord Leonard
to surrender on hopes of pardon. How far Lord Leonard
may be said to have entrapped his unfortunate nephew
by false assurances was never quite clear; but the result
was the seizure and committal to the Tower of Lord
Thomas and his five uncles. His name and arms carved
on the gloomy wall of the Beauchamp Tower bear witness
to his confinement in that dreary prison, which lasted





<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>
about a year before he was taken to Tyburn and there
hanged, with his uncles. It was said that the Duke of
Norfolk advised this cruel delay, on the ground that to
execute them at once would have cast dishonour on
Lord Leonard Grey; while, on the other hand, if a
certain time were allowed previously to elapse, other
circumstances might be supposed to have transpired concerning their rebellion which would to a certain degree
disconnect their execution from the actual seizure and
delivery of their persons by their kinsman.</p>

          <p>ON  Her present Majesty's first visit to the
          Tower of London, the spot in front of
          St. Peter's Chapel, where the unfortunate
          Anne Boleyn received her death-stroke,
was pointed out as one of melancholy interest, and by
Her Majesty's personal commands a small brass tablet
recording the event was placed in the middle of the
space where the scaffold upon which she received
the blow of the executioner had been erected.  The
suddenness of this unfortunate lady's transition from
favour to disgrace, and from disgrace to death, is not
the least affecting part of her story.
 </p><p>   It was on the 1st May, 1536, that during a tournament at Greenwich, she dropped her handkerchief, which
one of the courtiers took up and put to his face with such a
gesture as to excite the King's suspicions; if indeed those
suspicions ever in reality existed, or were other than the
pretence for removing Anne, to make way for the new
object of his desire.  Next day the Queen's brother,
Lord Rochford, Norris, Weston, and Brereton, all gentlemen about the Court, and Smeton, a musician, were committed, and Anne herself arrested and placed in the






<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>

Tower, under charge of Sir W. Kingston, the Lieutenant,
entreating in vain to speak but one word to the King,
and solemnly protesting her innocence of any offence
against him. That officer, in his letter to Secretary
Cromwell, tells him, that as he led the Queen to her
lodgings, she asked was she to go into a dungeon? to
which he had said, " No, Madam, but to the same
lodging where she lay before her coronation."
  </p><p>   " It is gude for me, she sayd; Jesu have mercy on
me; and kneeled down weeping apace, and in the same
sorrow fell into great lawyng, which she hath often done
since "-violent hysterics caused by her distress and terror
were probably what Kingston described as "lawyng."
He further tells the Secretary, of her passionate protestation of her innocence, and of her expressions of sorrow
for her brother, and the other gentlemen involved, for no
fault of theirs, in the cruel accusations of her enemies.
 </p><p>    Sir W. Kingston seems to have been deeply touched
with the unhappy Queen's behaviour, and though he was
ordered to set Lady Kingston to watch for any unguarded
words she might utter, he evidently obeyed these orders
with pain, and mitigated the misery of her position as far
as he dared.
  </p><p>   On the 10th of May, the three gentlemen accused of
familiarities with the Queen were tried, and, without a
shadow of proof, declared guilty. On the 13th, the Queen
and her brother were tried in the Council Chamber of the
Tower, and on charges the most frivolous and unreasonable, Rochford was found guilty. The wretched Smeton
was, by false hopes of life, induced to confess the guilt of



<pb id="p.57" n="57"/>



<figure id="Fig.023" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00023"><head>
              INTERIOR OF THE BEAUCHAMP TOWER.</head></figure>

the Queen, upon which evidence she was condemned,
by direct instructions to the Court from her barbarous
husband, to die either by burning or beheading, according
to the King's pleasure. On the 17th, Rochford with the
other three gentlemen was beheaded on Tower Hill; and
Smeton, in violation of the promise of life by which the
condemnation of the Queen had been so basely extorted
from him, was hanged at the same time.
 </p><p>   Kingston's letter, written next morning to Cromwell,






<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>

informs him that, according to his orders, he had caused
all strangers to be put out of the Tower, suggesting at
the same time that it would be best to have a reasonable
number of persons admitted to witness the Queen's
execution. "This morning," he says, "she sent for me,
that I might be with her at such time as she received the
'Gude Lord' (sacrament), to the intent that I should
hear her touching her innocency, &amp;c. At my coming
she sayd, ' Mr. Kingston, I heare I shall not dye afore
noon; and I am very sorry therefore; for I thought to
be dead now and past my pain. I told her it would
be no pain, it was so sotell" (alluding to the skill of
the headsman). Then she sayd, ' I have heard the
executioner was very good, and I have a lyttel neck,' and
put her hand about it lawing hartily. I have seen many
men, and also women executed, and they have been in
great sorrowe; but to my knowinge thys ladye has much
joy and pleasure in death."
  </p><p>  The Queen had afterwards an interview with Lady
Kingston, in which she made the most affecting and
solemn protestation of her innocence, probably rather
to relieve her overburthened heart, than with any hope
of mercy from the King. Next day the unhappy Queen
was brought out for execution in front of the chapel upon
Tower Green.
  </p><p>  The exclusion of the public had no doubt been
deemed necessary, lest the sight of her beauty and her
declarations of innocence might excite a popular tumult.
About thirty persons were appointed by the King to be
present as witnesses of her death. She behaved with
much resignation and self-command, kneeling down to




       <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>

receive the stroke of death, but without any block before
her, as the Calais executioner did not use the axe, but
one of those long, heavy, two-handled swords, which were
formerly used in some cities of Germany, as the instruments
of execution. As she could not refrain from turning her
eyes on the man, he became nervous and uncertain how
to deal his blow, when at last he took off his shoes, and
causing his assistant to approach and attract her attention
on the right, he stepped up behind her left shoulder, and
with one heavy sweep of his huge sword, struck off her
head in an instant. No respect was shown to the Queen's
body, which was thrown into a chest made for holding
bows and arrows, and buried, along with the corpse
of her brother, in St. Peter's Chapel.  Such was the
end of this most unfortunate lady, who but three years
before had entered the Tower in triumph as the idol of
the King, and the admiration of all around her. Levities
which even now would be thought slight and pardonable,
but which in that coarse and licentious Court could hardly
deserve even a moderate censure, were the only offences
proved against her, unless the extorted accusation of
Smeton can be regarded as proof of any deeper guilt.
  </p><p>  On the other hand, she had by her gentleness and
frequent mediation, between her savage husband and
those who had the ill fortune to offend him, gained the
favour of the nobility and the affection of the people;
and the precaution used at her execution showed the
likelihood of an insurrectionary movement, had the public been allowed to assemble within the Tower and to
witness this cruel scene.</p>

      <p>THIS young lady was the daughter of Sir W.
            Askew, of an old Lincolnshire family. She
            was married early to a Mr. Kyme; but
            unhappily it was a marriage entirely of
interest, and arranged by the two families without any
reference to Anne's inclinations, which from the bad character of young Kyme, as well as his religious bigotry,
were wholly averse to it. Overruled by her father, she at
length reluctantly consented; and though she conducted
herself admirably as a wife, and bore to Mr. Kyme two
children, his dissipation and neglect prevented anyconjugal
happiness between them. Having received a learned education, and being of studious habits, she turned readily
from her domestic sorrows to the study of the Bible, now
for the first time accessible to the English laity, and
became a professed follower of Wickliffe. Her husband,
who, without any real principles of religion, was an intolerant Papist, took occasion from this circumstance to
cast her off, and expel her from his house, when she
betook herself to a residence in London, where she had
many friends favourable to the reformed opinions. Queen
Katherine Parr herself was among the friends of Mrs.



  <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>

Kyme; and it has been said that Anne was placed in
some situation about the Queen's person for a short
time. The promulgation of the Six Articles, sometimes
called the "Whip with six strings," which the tyrant
Henry VIII. had set up as the standard for his subjects'
faith, tended to draw closer those friends of Anne Kyme
who shared her religious opinions, and who probably
foresaw the persecutions which awaited her. There is
reason to suppose that her own unworthy husband combined with others to place spies about her in London,
who soon found an occasion of denouncing her for expressions which brought her under the general charge of
heresy. In March, 1545, she was summoned before an
Inquest or Commission at Guildhall, and subjected to
a long examination by one Dare, when she displayed
an intelligence and shrewdness which, with her modest,
gentle demeanour, drew the admiration even of her
enemies.  Being remanded to the Compter, she was
shortly after brought before Bishop Bonner for examination, who exercised all his subtlety to entangle her in
her replies; and at length drew out a written summary,
in which he had grossly perverted their meaning, and
desired her, after hearing it read, to declare whether or
not she would subscribe to its contents.  Her answer
merits to be recorded. "I believe," she said, "as much
thereof as is agreeable to the Holy Scriptures; and I
desire that this sentence may be added to it." Furious
at what he called her obstinate evasions, Bonner was about
to proceed to violent extremities, when by the intercession of some powerful friends, and probably for other





<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>

reasons, she was allowed to be released on the bail of
her cousin, one Brittayne, who, during the examination,
at which he was present, had judiciously entreated the
Bishop "not to set her weak woman's wit to his lordship's great wisdom."
   </p><p>  We have no record of the cause, or rather pretext,
of her being, about three months afterwards, again arrested.
This time her husband, Kyme, was brought up along
with her before the Privy Council, sitting at Greenwich.
 </p><p>    Wriothesley, the Chancellor, now undertook her examination, and chiefly on the great point of Transubstantiation, on which she firmly refused to abandon her own
convictions, and was committed to Newgate; from whence
she wrote some devotional letters, which show her to
have possessed considerable talent. Her next appearance
was before the Council, at Guildhall, when, after an examination by a silly Lord Mayor (Martin), in which she
entirely foiled him by her simplicity and good sense, she
was plainly told, that unless she renounced her errors, and
distinctly declared her acquiescence in the Six Articles,
she must prepare to die; and, on her firm refusal, she
was condemned, without any trial by jury, to be burned
as an heretic. Meantime, instead of being sent back
to Newgate, she was committed to the Tower, with a
view to subject her to the torture of the rack, for which
the gloomy seclusion of that fortress afforded greater convenience than the ordinary prison of Newgate, with the
hope of inducing her to criminate the Duchess of Suffolk,
the Countess of Sussex, the Countess of Hertford, and
other ladies, who were supposed to have assisted her



    <pb id="p.63" n="63"/>

with money for her support in prison. She was too high-minded and grateful to betray them; and whatever might
have been the case, she declared that she had been
chiefly kept from starvation by her faithful maid, who
went out and begged for her of the " prentices and others
she met in the street."
  </p><p>  The unhappy lady was now carried to a dungeon,
and laid on the rack in presence of the Lieutenant of the
Tower, Sir A. Knyvett, and Wriothesley, the Chancellor,
Rich, a creature of Bonner's, and a secretary, sitting at
her side, to take down her words. But when she endured
the torture without opening her lips in reply to the Chancellor's questions, he became furious, and seizing the
wheel himself, strained it with all his force, till Knyvett,
revolting at such cruelty, insisted on her release from the
dreadful machine. It was but in time to save her life,
for she had twice swooned, and her limbs had been so
stretched, and her joints so injured, that she was never
again able to walk without support. Wriothesley hastened
to Westminster to complain to the King of the Lieutenant's lenity; but the latter, getting into his barge with
a favourable tide, arrived before him, obtained immediate audience, and told his tale so honestly, and with
such earnestness, that Henry's hard heart was softened,
and, approving his conduct, he dismissed him with
favour: a stronger reason for this may have been that
the rack was regarded with such horror by the people
as to be applied only in secrecy; and had Anne
expired under it, and the fact become known, some
violent outbreak might have been apprehended in the





<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>
City. She was shortly afterwards carried to Smithfield,
and there burned to ashes, together with three other
persons, for the same cause, in the presence of the Duke
of Norfolk, the Earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Wriothesley,
the Lord Mayor, and a vast concourse of people. One
of the peers, learning that there was some gunpowder
about the stakes, became frightened lest any accident
should happen to himself, from the faggots being blown
into the air; but the Earl of Bedford assuring him that
no such chance could occur, and it was only to hasten
the deaths of the sufferers, he remained looking on with
the same barbarous indifference as the brutal mob, who
had assembled to witness the dreadful spectacle.</p>

         <p>ALTHOUGH this unfortunate victim of the
           jealousy and caution of Henry VIII. was
           in no respect a prominent historical character, except as regards the high and
peculiar position in which his birth had placed him in
relation to the English Crown, yet few have been so
unhappily remarkable for one of those long and weary
captivities of the Tower which seem almost painful to
record.
  </p><p>  During the short period he was allowed to emerge
from his prison, he had just time to taste those pleasures
of life and youth to which his noble manners and handsome person would have given him easy and agreeable
access, when he was again confined, and released only to
end his few remaining days in a foreign land.
   </p><p> Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire and Marquis
of Exeter, was born about 1526, and when his father was
beheaded, he being then twelve years old, was committed
to the Tower, lest "he should avenge his father's wrongs."
He continued there through the reigns of Henry VIII.
and Edward VI., being excepted by name from the

general pardon proclaimed on the coronation of the
latter. On the accession of Mary to the throne she set
him free, and showed him much favour, and some say,
from his personal beauty and his royal extraction, was
disposed to single him  out from  among her various
suitors. He, however, showed a great preference for
the Princess Elizabeth, and thus falling into disfavour
with the Queen, was again committed to the Tower,
whence, after a year's imprisonment, he obtained the
Queen's leave to travel to Italy, and died at Padua,
October 4th of the same year, 1556. <note place="foot" n="1">See Cleaveland's ' History of Courtenay Family.'</note> "This Earl was
born to be a prisoner, for from twelve years of age to
almost thirty, when he died, he had enjoyed scarcely two
years of liberty." He was the twelfth Earl of Devonshire of that name and family, second Marquis of Exeter,
and fifteenth Baron of Okehampton.</p>

          <p>THE day after Sir Thomas Wyatt broke out
          into open rebellion, Sir Richard Southwell,
          Sir Edward Hastings, and Sir Thomas
            Cornwallis, were despatched to the house
of the Princess Elizabeth, at Ashridge, in Hertfordshire,
with a guard of two hundred and fifty horse, to bring
her a prisoner to London; and the manner in which
these gentlemen executed their commission, reflects but
little honour on their names. Elizabeth was at the
time confined by severe illness, and, notwithstanding that
the messengers did not arrive at Ashridge till ten
o'clock at night, they immediately sent her word, that
they were bearers of a message from the Queen, and
forced their way straight to her bedroom, a rudeness at
which her high spirit revolted.  Although worn down
by sickness, her manner of receiving them marked her
indignation at their conduct. She expressed surprise
that they should, unbidden, have intruded themselves
there at such an hour of the night; inquiring, "Is the
haste such, that you could not have waited till the morning ?" But their answer was, that they came to do their
duty, by orders of the Queen, whose pleasure it was that






<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>
she should repair with them without delay to London,
adding, that "They must take her with them whether
quick or dead." Nor could her own remonstrances, or
the entreaties of her household, prevail upon them to
have any consideration for her state of health. She was
strictly guarded that night, and on the following morning,
at nine o'clock, was placed in a litter, and compelled to
commence her journey towards London; yet, so serious
was her illness, that they could proceed no farther
than Redburne, where she rested that night. On the
following day, they reached St. Albans, where she lay at
Sir Ralph Poulet's, and on the next, arrived at " Maister
Dodde's house," at South Mymmes, where she remained
that night; and thence, on the fourth day, they brought
her to Highgate; but her illness was now become so
much more dangerous, that it was found necessary on
the following morning to delay her further journey, and
many messengers in the interim passed to and fro from
the Queen and Council, as to the question of her ability
to proceed.
   </p><p> During her journey, the people had assembled in
crowds upon the road to see her, and Elizabeth had
everywhere the gratification of receiving the strongest
demonstrations of the interest that was so generally felt
in her fate; on the sixth day especially, when she was
conveyed from Highgate to London, many gentlemen
rode out to meet her, as a mark of their attachment to
her person, and multitudes thronged about her litter,
"lamenting and bewailing her estate."
 </p><p>   Upon Elizabeth's arrival at Whitehall, she was shut up



   <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

a close prisoner, under the charge of the Chamberlain and
Vice-Chamberlain, without communication with any one
for near a fortnight; when, on the Friday before Palm
Sunday, the Bishop of Winchester, and nineteen others
of the Council, came from the Queen, and charged her
with being privy to Wyat's conspiracy, alleging that she
had held correspondence with the Carews and other
gentlemen in the west; and although she utterly denied
these things, and protested her innocence, they informed
her that it was her Majesty's will and pleasure that she
should go to the Tower, until the matter should be
further tried and examined.
  </p><p>  At the idea of going to the Tower Elizabeth was
struck with dismay; she reiterated the vows of her innocence, and of her truth and loyalty to the Queen; and
desired the Lords to intercede with her sister, that, being
neither in thought, nor word, nor deed, untrue towards
her Majesty, she might not be committed to so notorious
and doleful a place.  But nothing could avail! The
Lords departed, assuring her that there was no remedy,
for that it was The Queen's Majesty's determination that
to the Tower she should go; and, in an hour afterwards,
the Lord Steward and the Earl of Sussex returned with
a guard, and, removing all her servants and attendants,
substituted a gentleman usher, two grooms of the chamber,
and three gentlewomen of The Queen's in their place;
"and there were put an hundred of northern soldiers in
white coats, watching and warding about the garden all
that night; a great fire being made in the midst of the
hall, and two Lords watching there also, with their band
and company."







<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>
  </p><p>   On the following morning the Earl of Sussex, and
another Lord whose name does not appear, came to
inform her, that forthwith she must go to the Tower,
and that the tide served, and the barge was in readiness.
In great distress, she begged for delay, and implored
permission to see or write to The Queen. The unnamed
Lord. however, answered sternly, that he durst not permit
it. adding, that in his judgment it would rather hurt than
profit her in doing so; but Sussex, more courteous and
feeling than his companion, kneeled down, and told her
Highness, that she should have liberty to write to The
Queen her sister, pledging his honour that he would
convey her letter, and bring an answer to it; and so for
that day her removal was delayed. On the morrow, being
Palm Sunday, in order that she might be conveyed to the
Iower with more privacy, it was directed throughout the
capital, that the people should all repair to church and
  carry their palms ;" and in the mean time Sussex and
  the other lord again waited upon her, declaring that she
  must immediately accompany them to the Tower.
  </p><p>    Elizabeth now began to think that every hope
 had vanished; she declared she marvelled what the
 nobility of the realm  could mean, in suffering her
 to be thus led to prison; and, desiring the Earl of
 Sussex and his companion to proceed, she followed
 them down the garden to the barge. There went with
 her, besides the guards, the two Lords, three of the
 Queen's gentlewomen, and three of her own, her gentleman usher, and two grooms of her chamber. In passing
 London Bridge, owing to the great fall of water at halftide, the whole party narrowly escaped with their lives.
</p><p><figure id="Fig.028" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00028"><head>THE TOWER OF LONDON IN THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH</head></figure></p>


  <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>


  <p>  When they came to the Tower, the barge was steered
to that dismal entrance, known by the name of the Traitors' Gate, where Elizabeth would fain have avoided the





<figure id="Fig.029" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00029"><head>TRAITORS' GATE.</head></figure>


degradation of landing, till the unnamed lord resolutely
told her, that " she should not choose." It rained, and he
offered her his cloak, but, "putting it back with her
hand with a good dash," she indignantly refused it, and,
as she set her foot upon the steps, said with her wonted
spirit, " Here landeth as true a subject, being a prisoner,
as ever landed at these stairs, and before Thee, 0 God, I







<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>

speak it, having none other friends but Thee !"  On her
ascending into the fortress, she found the Guards and
Warders drawn out in order, at which she expressed surprise; and, on being informed that it was the custom, when
prisoners entered, she desired that, if it were so, for her
cause they might be dismissed: "whereat the poor men
kneeled down, and with one voice prayed God to preserve her; for which, on the next day, they were all
discharged '" Passing a little further, she sat down on a
stone, and there rested herself. The Lieutenant pressed
her to rise out of the rain, but she answered, " Better sit
here than in a worse place; for God knoweth whither
you will bring me ;" and, turning to her gentleman usher,
she rebuked him: "You ought rather to comfort than
dismay me," said she, " especially for that I know my
truth to be such, that no man shall have cause to weep
for my sake."
  </p><p>   She then arose and was conducted to her prison; and
when the doors were locked, and she was close shut up,
the Lords of the Council " had great conference how to
keel) ward and watch, every man declaring his opinion
in that behalf, agreeing streightly and circumspectly to
keep her:" but the Earl of Sussex, who still continued
her friend, and was influenced by a nobler soul, said
with an oath, " My lords, let us take heed, and do not
more than our commission will bear us out in, whatever
shall happen hereafter; and, further, let us consider that
she is The King's our Master's daughter, and therefore
we should use such dealing, that we may answer to it
hereafter, if it shall so happen :for just dealing," said he,



    <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>

"is always answerable."  This advice in some degree
prevailed, and so the Lords departed.
 </p><p>   Of the many prisoners accused of sharing in the
insurrection of Wyatt, who were confined at this time in
the Tower, some were closely examined, while on others
every art was tried, either by the torture of the rack, by
hopes of pardon, or promises of reward, to obtain evidence
that might have afforded Mary any pretext for wreaking
her vengeance on a sister who was so much the object
of her jealousy and hatred. Nor were any endeavours
neglected to entrap the Princess into criminating herself.
She had been but a few days in the Tower, before
Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, and many others of the
Council, came and examined her, touching a conversation
which they charged her with having held at Ashridge,
with Sir James Crofts, on the subject of her removal from
thence to her castle at Donnington. To which, after a
moment's recollection, she answered, " Indeed I do now
remember that I have such a place, but I never lay in
it in my life; and as for any that may have moved me
thereto, I do not remember."  Yet, "to enforce the
matter," they brought Sir James before her, and Gardiner,
who was ever Elizabeth's bitter enemy, demanded what
she had to say to that man? She answered that she
had little to say to him, or to any others who were then
prisoners in the Tower.  " But, my Lords," said she,
"you do examine every mean prisoner of me, wherein
methinks you do me great injury. If they have done
evil, and have offended the Queen's majesty, let them
answer to it accordingly; and I beseech you, my Lords,






<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>
join not me in this sort, with any of these offenders.
As concerning my going to Donnington Castle, I do
remember that Mr. Hobby and mine officers, and you,
Sir James Crofts, had such talk; but what is that to
the purpose, my Lords? May I not go to mine own
houses at all times ? " To which the Earl of Arundell,
kneeling, replied, "Your Grace saith true, and certainly
we are sorry that we have so troubled you about such
vain matters." " My Lords," said she, " you do sift me
very narrowly; but well am I assured you shall not do
more to me than God hath appointed, and so God forgive you all."
  </p><p>  The Lords were then about to depart, but Sir James
Crofts first kneeled down before the Princess, declaring
that he was sorry to see the day that he should be brought
as a witness against her; "but I assure your Grace,"
said he, " I have been marvellously tossed, and examined,
touching your Highness, which, the Lord knoweth, is very
strange to me; for I take God to witness, before all your
honours, I do not know anything of that crime which
you have laid to my charge, and will thereupon take my
death, if I should be driven to so strait a trial."
  </p><p>   Elizabeth's confinement in the Tower was of a
harsh and severe description; mass was constantly obtruded upon her in her apartment; for a whole month
she was shut up, without the liberty of even passing
the threshold of her prison; and, afterwards, when
she had obtained permission from the Council to take
the air in the Queen's garden, she was always attended
by the Constable, the Lieutenant, and a guard; indeed,



     <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>

so rigidly was she watched, that a little boy only four years
of age, who was wont to pay affectionate visits to her
and other prisoners, and to bring them flowers, was suspected of being employed as a messenger between her
and the Earl of Devonshire; and his father, an inferior
officer in the fortress, was charged by the Constable and
Lieutenant, to prevent his little son from  repeating
his visits to the prisoners.  They strictly examined
the child, and, with promises of figs and apples, endeavoured to extract some ground for accusation. After questioning the little fellow when he had been last with Lady
Elizabeth and the Earl of Devonshire, they asked him
what the Earl had sent by him to her Grace ? And notwithstanding the simplicity of the child's reply, " That he
would go and know what he would give to carry to her,"
the Constable, who was also Lord Chamberlain, gravely
declared his suspicion that there lurked beneath a plot.
"This same is a crafty boy," said he; "how say you, my
Lord Chandos ? "  " Ay, my Lord," cried the child, "but
pray give me the figs you promised me."  "No, marry,"
quoth the suspicious officer, " you shall be whipped if you
come any more to the Lady Elizabeth, or to the Lord
Courtenay."
  </p><p>   A quarrel narrated by Hollingshed between the Constable and the Princess's attendants, about her provisions,
gives a fair instance of the manner in which prisoners,
even of her high rank, were exposed to the extortion of
the chief officers of the Tower in those days.
  </p><p>   Sir John Gage, the Constable, had given order that
the Princess's servants, when they brought her dinner to







<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>
the gates, were not to be allowed to enter, but were to
deliver it to the hands of the " common rascall souldiers."
This the servants objected to, on the ground that much
of the victuals might be consumed on the way to her
Grace's lodgings; but the only answer they received from
the Constable to their remonstrance was, that, " if they
presumed either to frown or shrug at him, he would sette
them where they should see neither sunne nor moon."
  </p><p>  An appeal was then made to the Lords of the
Council, who appointed, that fourteen of the Princess's
own servants should be admitted to superintend the
cooking of her Grace's viands. Though forced to submit,
the Constable was ill pleased at this decision. " And good
cause why," says Hollingshed, " for he had good cheare
and fared of the best, while her Grace paid for it."
  </p><p>  Though examined closely from time to time by the
Commissioners from the Council, the shrewdness and
presence of mind of Elizabeth enabled her to avoid
every snare that was laid for her, on these occasions;
and Wyatt having to the last persisted, to his honour,
in asserting her total ignorance of his schemes, she was
eventually released from the Tower on the 19th of May,
and conveyed to a less rigid restraint at Woodstock,
under the charge of Sir Henry Bedingfield.
 </p><p>   It was during her stay at Woodstock, that Elizabeth
received great kindness from the family of Sir Thomas
Williams, and formed that grateful friendship for one of
his daughters, which in after life brought out one of the
rare instances where Elizabeth was known to exhibit any
true tenderness of affection for one of her own sex.



     <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>

   </p><p> Miss Williams became the wife of the gallant Sir
John Norris, and had four sons by him, who were each
of them renowned in the land, or sea service of their
country. It was on occasion of the younger of these
being killed in battle, that the Queen addressed to Lady
Norris that touching letter of condolence quoted by
Miss Strickland, beginning " Mine own dear Crow," a
familiar nickname given by Elizabeth to this lady in the
early days of their Woodstock friendship, on account
of the raven black of her long and beautiful hair.
  </p><p>  There is a tradition that on the removal of Elizabeth from the Tower some of the City churches rang
their bells for her deliverance, and that she afterwards,
in token of gratitude, presented them with silk bellropes. On an inquiry made a few years ago, it was
ascertained that some silk bell-ropes, of very ancient date,
had long been preserved in a chest in the vestry of the
church of Aldgate, but no proof of their present existence could be found.
  </p><p>  Upon the death of Mary in November, 1558, Parliament being then sitting, the Commons were summoned to
the Bar of the House of Lords, and the event of Elizabeth's accession was announced by the Lord Chancellor,
Archbishop Heath, to the whole Assembly. It was received with acclamations, such as had probably never
before greeted a new Sovereign.  The news spread
through London, accompanied by every demonstration
of joy, and was carried to every part of the kingdom
amidst the rejoicings of all classes of the Queen's
subjects.







<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>
   </p><p> It was at Hatfield that Elizabeth received the intelligence of this great change in her fortunes. As soon as
preparation could be made for her reception, she arrived
at Lord North's residence in the Charter-house, and
after staying there a few days, to give time for suitable
arrangements, she moved into the Tower, the scene of
her former danger and captivity, and established her
Court with all the solemnity and splendour suitable to the
great occasion.
  </p><p>  In the early part of the month of December, Queen
Elizabeth removed from the Tower, by water, to Somerset
House, and sojourned there with her Court till after her
sister's funeral, when she proceeded to her palace at Westminster, and there celebrated the festival of Christmas.
   </p><p>  In the mean time great preparations were being
made for the accustomed cavalcade through the city, and
for the ceremonies of the Coronation. The day appointed
was Sunday, the 15th of January, and on the Thursday
preceding she returned by water to the Tower, where
she was welcomed by the nobility and great officers
of state, who had assembled to receive her. She was
" attended by the Mayor and aldermen in their barge,
and all the crafts in their barges, decked and trimmed
with the targets and banners of their misteries;" and
thus, " with great and pleasant melody of instruments,
which played in most sweet and heavenly manner," her
Majesty passed the bridge about two o'clock, and entered
the fortress at the well-remembered Traitors' Gate, under
which, but a few years before, she had been landed an
oppressed and calumniated prisoner.




   <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>

  </p><p>  The day of her Majesty's procession from the Tower
had been prepared for by the citizens with greater pains
and expense than was ever before witnessed; and we
are expressly told, that the splendid and more than
usually magnificent pageantry and decorations which
ornamented the streets on that occasion, were entirely
accomplished without the aid of any foreign person.
  </p><p>  The procession from the Tower began in the afternoon with trumpets and heralds, and we are informed
by a contemporary writer that the Queen, previous to
her leaving the royal apartments, lifted up her hands
towards heaven, and returned most hearty thanks " to
the Almighty and ever-living God, that He had been so
merciful unto her as to spare her to see that joyful day,
acknowledging that He had dealt as mercifully and wonderfully with her, as He did with his true and faithful
servant Daniel, the prophet, whom He delivered out of
the den, from the cruel and raging lions." Her Majesty was
seated in an open chariot sumptuously adorned, and "most
honourably accompanied, as well with gentlemen, barons,
and other nobility of her realm, as also with a notable
train of goodly and beautiful ladies, richly appointed."
The streets through which the Queen had to pass were
decorated with costly drapery, and lined with the various
crafts or companies of the City, " well apparelled with
many rich furs, and their livery hoods upon their
shoulders;" and before them stood " sundry persons
clad in silks and chains of gold." In several parts of the
City stages and triumphal arches were erected. The first
of these was in Fenchurch Street, where Her Majesty's







<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>

progress was arrested by a child in costly apparel, who,
on behalf of the City, addressed her with a welcoming
oration: the next was a magnificent arch, spanning the
street near Gracechurch, and adorned with " goodly
pageaunts," representing the union and emblems of the
houses of York and Lancaster: a third, in Cornhill,
equally magnificent, was denominated "the seate of
worthy governaunce;" in which, besides the eight Beatitudes, and other representations suitable to the occasion,
were the cardinal Virtues, treading under foot the opposite
Vices; among which were Ignorance and Superstition.
At the standard in Cheapside, the Recorder, in the name
of the City, presented a thousand marks of gold, in a
purse of crimson velvet, as a token of their affectionate
loyalty to a sovereign "whose prosperity they wished,
and whose protection they implored:" there she also
received a Bible in English, which was let down to her
as if from heaven, by the hand of a child representing
Truth; a gift which she accepted with the strongest marks
of reverence; declaring that it gave her more real gratification than all the other endearing proofs that she had
that day experienced of her people's love.
 </p><p>     The last and grandest of all the Pageants was another
 triumphal arch, on which, represented sitting under a
 palm-tree, was " a seemly mete personage richly apparelled
 in parliament robes, with a sceptre in her hand, as a
 queen," with the superscription, " Deborah, the judge and
 restorer of the house of Israel." At Temple Bar, the
 western limit of the City, the two giants, Gogmagog and
 Corineus, were stationed, with a scroll in Latin verse,



   <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

expounding the meaning of all the representations that
Her Majesty had previously passed: and there, "with
her hearty commendations," she bade the citizens farewell.
It was observed of Elizabeth that, by her kind and affable
deportment on that day, she gained more on the affections of the people than many other princes had been
able to do, by more real and substantial acts of grace
and favour.</p>

        <p>AMONG the many crimes for which offenders
           have been committed to the Tower, none
           were of a more savage character, nor more
           indicative of the loose administration of law
at a distance from the capital in the early periods of
our history, than the barbarous and deliberate murder
in Somersetshire of a neighbouring country gentleman
and his son by Lord Stourton, during the reign of
Queen Mary, whose determined resolution to bring the
murderer to justice, as soon as the facts became known
to her, is one of the few acts which reflect credit on her
reign.
  </p><p>   It appears that this nobleman, who had large estates
and considerable influence in Wiltshire and Somersetshire, took violent umbrage at the kind and prudent advice given by a Mr. Hartgill to his mother, Lady Stourton,
while she was a guest at his country-seat near Kilmington.
Lord Stourton wished to obtain from her a bond that she
would not re-marry, and desired Hartgill to assist in
persuading her to sign it, but he, being a man of honour
and respectability, advised her to do nothing of the



  <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

sort, unless Lord Stourton would first assign her a fixed
income, proportionate to her rank in life. This threw
Lord Stourton into a violent fury, and, collecting a party
of his tenantry and servants, he repaired to Kilmington,
the seat of the Hartgills, one Sunday, while the family
were at church in the adjoining village, and began to
plunder and spoil the mansion.
  </p><p>  The younger Hartgill, being told what was going on
by a servant who ran to him in the church, desired his
father and mother to remain for safety in the churchtower, while he, running across the churchyard to the
mansion, hard by, got safe within the gates, though Lord
Stourton's people shot several arrows at him as he passed.
He now strung his bow, with which he was an expert
marksman, and shot so fast and well at Lord Stourton's
party, that, after wounding several, he presently beat
them off. The unwarrantable attack on his house was
naturally complained of by Hartgill in the proper quarter,
and the Lords of the Council directed the sheriff of the
county to arrest Lord Stourton,.who was committed to
prison, from whence he was not released till he had been
bound over in due form to keep the peace towards the Hartgills for a year. This lenient treatment, however, did not
deter Lord Stourton from taking every occasion to avenge
himself on the Hartgills, destroying their crops, driving
their cattle, and annoying them by every sort of petty
persecution. About this time, the Queen making a journey
to Basingend, in Hampshire, the Hartgills took advantage
of this visit for a personal appeal to her Majesty, who
caused Lord Stourton to be summoned before the Council.








<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>

He promptly obeyed the summons, affected deep regret
for his conduct, and declared that, if the Hartgills would
come to his house and be reconciled to him, he would
make full restitution for all the harm he had done them.
  </p><p>  Trusting to this assurance, the father and son, accompanied by a friend, proceeded, after the departure of the
Queen from Basing-end, to Lord Stourton's house; but
their perfidious enemy had placed six ruffians in ambush,
in a narrow lane, and, before young Hartgill could draw
his sword, they attacked, and so wounded him, that he
was left for dead on the ground. Again the Queen was
appealed to, and the Star Chamber, causing Lord Stourton
to be seized aud brought prisoner before them in London,
committed him to the Fleet Prison, and sentenced him
to pay a considerable fine to the Hartgills. He contrived, however, by fair promises, to be again liberated
on giving a bond for 2000L. to appear for trial at the
next term, and returned home with his mind fully bent
on the destruction of the unfortunate Hartgills at all
hazards. In pursuance of his scheme, he sent a messenger to invite them to meet him and receive the fine
awarded them  by the Star Chamber, at Kilmington
Church.  This appeared so fair a proposal, that the
father and son did not hesitate to repair to the place
at the time appointed, but finding that Lord Stourton
had already arrived, and was attended by a number
of his servants and dependants, the elder Hartgill declared that they would not approach nearer to Lord
Stourton's party, nor have communication with him, except
in the church itself. As if to show his good faith, Lord



    <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>

Stourton produced a large purse of gold, and began to
discuss the amount of the payment due, but, having
gradually approached and got them within reach, he
suddenly cried out, "I arrest you both of felony," and,
as he was a magistrate of the county, his followers did
not hesitate to seize and bind the Hartgills hand and
foot, supposing that he had legal warrant for his proceeding.
  </p><p>  The Hartgills were then confined in the parsonagehouse, and the majority of Lord Stourton's tenants and followers dispersed. In the middle of that night the prisoners
were removed, and not without some rough usage on the
road, to Bonham, a house near Stourton Caundell; and the
next day Lord Stourton induced two justices of the peace
to go to Bonham and examine them, on the understanding that they should afterwards be committed direct to
the county gaol, and charges substantiated against them.
These magistrates, finding that there was no case, but
afraid of offending Lord Stourton, contented themselves
with ordering the removal of their bonds, and left them,
as they supposed, to be sent next day to prison.
  </p><p>  No sooner, however, had the two magistrates withdrawn, than Lord Stourton commanded four ruffians, whom
he had placed in charge of the Hartgills, again to bind
them hand and foot, and at ten o'clock that night they were
dragged to the garden of Stourton Caundell, where they
were thrown to the ground, and their brains beat out
by these villains, while their master stood, with a taper
in his hand, at a back door of the house, to witness the
completion of this bloody act. The bodies were then







<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>
carried through the back door, into a gallery, at the
end of which was a small vestibule, opening into Lord
Stourton's own apartment. Here, the old man's life not
being quite extinct, he uttered a deep groan, when Lord
Stourton, holding the candle, caused his throat to be
cut, for fear, as was afterwards deposed by one of the
murderers, that a French priest, who lay in a chamber
near, should hear his moans.
  </p><p>   In order to the concealment of the bodies of these
unfortunate gentlemen, they were buried very deep in a
sort of cellar beneath the mansion, and then laid over
with a double pavement, upon which a quantity of
shavings and sawdust was spread, to hide the spot. But
Sir Anthony Hungerford, the Sheriff of Wiltshire, who
already knew the malignity of Lord Stourton towards
the Hartgills, on being informed of the visit of the
two magistrates, and that, instead of the Hartgills
being lodged next day in the gaol on the charge of
felony, they had mysteriously disappeared, instantly set
on foot a strict search and inquiry.  Their removal
was soon traced to Stourton Caundell, and one of the
villains, concerned in the murder, having betrayed his
employer, the corpses of the unfortunate Hartgills were
discovered and disinterred. Sir Anthony instantly caused
Lord Stourton to be apprehended, and on his reporting the facts to the Council, an order came down to
send him to London, and lodge him in the Tower.
He was shortly after arraigned in the Tower, before a
Special Commission, consisting of the Lord Chief Justice,
with some of the other judges, the Lord Steward, and



     <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

the Lord Chamberlain. The four servants who had been
his instruments in this barbarous murder were sent for
trial to Salisbury.
 </p><p>   Lord Stourton had shown, at various times, great
zeal for the Catholic interests; and the Hartgills being
Protestants, it was rather apprehended that the Queen
might favour him; but Mary fully shared the public
indignation, at the barbarity of the crime, and rejected
all intercession in favour of the murderer.
  </p><p>  Lord Stourton was treated with great severity, for he
was carried to Salisbury on horseback, with his arms
pinioned, and his legs tied under the horse; the first day
to Hounslow; the second to Staines; the third to Basing;
and the fourth to Salisbury, where he was hanged in the
Market Place. His execution is the first instance, where
any record appears of the privilege claimed by Peers,
of being hanged with a rope of silk, a privilege, be it
observed, which was not altogether an empty distinction,
for there can be no doubt that a much slenderer cord
of silk will bear the weight of a man's body without risk
of breaking, than any cord made of hemp, and the smaller
the rope, the more sudden and complete is the strangulation, especially as the smoother material causes the
noose to close more effectually upon the windpipe.
   </p><p>  Lord Stourton's servants were hanged near the scene
of the murder, and their bodies were afterwards suspended
there in chains. Hanging in chains has been for so many
years discontinued, that the manner of it is no longer
generally known, and many might imagine that a chain
was really used for the execution of the criminal, instead







<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>

of a rope. But this was not so; the man was in
the first instance hanged in the ordinary way, with a
hempen cord, and, after he was dead and cut down from
the gibbet, a stout canvas dress was put on the body,
well saturated with tar; the face, hands, and feet were
likewise daubed with it, and then a light frame of hoop-
iron was fitted round the legs, body, and arms, with the
object of causing the ghastly remains to hang together
as long as possible. At the top of this framework, was an
iron loop, which went over the head, and 'to this was
secured the chain, by which the corpse was finally suspended to a lofty gibbet made of oak, and studded with
tenterhooks, to prevent any one from climbing up to
remove the body. The last of these hideous spectacles
might be seen, as recently as the year 1816, on the point,
formed by the curve of the river Thames, a mile below
Greenwich, where the wasted corpses of four lascars,
hanged for mutiny and the murder of the captain and
most of the crew of an Indiaman, were still hanging in
chains from a lofty gibbet.</p>

      <p>   FEW  victims of a harsh and cruel exercise
       of the laws of treason have excited more
           interest than Lady Jane Grey. Her entire
           innocence of all personal guilt, her devotion
to her ambitious parents, and her position as a young
and tender bride, all combine to render her story one
of the saddest of those which stain the annals of the
Tower. That her father was, to all intents, guilty of a
deliberate and determined act of treason, cannot be
questioned, nor that he deserved a traitor's doom; but it
seems to have been a needless severity to involve her in
the same fate as her father, when no other crime could
be alleged against her, than a reluctant obedience to the
solicitations and authority of her parents.  The extraordinary learning and acquirements of Lady Jane Grey
increased the general sympathy for her fate, nor is it very
easy in these days to realise the early progress of so
young a lady in classical studies.  But so many other
women of high rank, who lived about that period, were
distinguished for what would now be regarded as an
abstruse education, that it may be permitted to offer a
few observations on this interesting point.







<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>

 </p><p>    The lives of the nobility and gentry of England in
the sixteenth century, with exception of such as were employed in offices of state, or attached to the Court of the
Sovereign, were chiefly passed on their estates, in a state
and grandeur almost resembling that of petty princes.
Hunting and warlike exercises, especially manege horsemanship, were the ordinary occupation of the young men,
and many of the ladies took part with them, in the
pleasures of the chase. But such ladies as had less taste
for outdoor exercises were either devoted to household
cares, the management of their large establishments, and
the arts of embroidery and the needle, or betook themselves, from early years, to such studies as suited the
fashion of the time, and could be attained by study
of that narrow compass of literature, which the scanty
libraries of their castles and mansions afforded.  But a
far wider field lay open to them, in the classical and
theological collections of books and manuscripts, which
were to be found in the monasteries and ecclesiastical
establishments of England of that period. The constant
discussions and arguments which attended the progress
of the Reformation, brought forward a number of men
who applied their extensive knowledge of the dead
languages, to theological and controversial writing. Many
of those, who took leading parts in these learned discussions, were received as honoured guests in the houses
of the great; and the poverty of others rendered such
asylums their resource and refuge, in distress or persecution. It was natural for their hosts and protectors to avail
themselves of the services of such learned persons for the



  <pb id="p.91" n="91"/>

education of their children; and since little distinction
then existed between the learning regarded as desirable
for youth of either sex, these Preceptors probably obtained more diligent attention to their instructions from
the young ladies of the family, than from the wild and
spirited youths who looked to the chase, as their present
amusement, and to war, for the occupation of their more
manly years. No instances, or at all events very rare
ones, can be found in the domestic records of the noble
families of those days, of any such female instructors as
would correspond to our modern notions of a governess.
Music was universally taught by masters, and what are
now known as female accomplishments can hardly be
said to have existed at the period to which we refer.
  </p><p>   These and other causes, too long to enumerate, will
account for the surprising degree of classical knowledge
attained by a girl of such tender age as Lady Jane; and
will remove the impression which might at first present
itself of any conceit or pedantry in this unfortunate
young lady's display of her learning, at a time when
the preparation for death in so religious and pure a
mind might be supposed to engross every thought. But
the calm resignation aud unaffected piety with which she
prepared for her doom, show that her presence of mind
never deserted her, or threw her mind off that natural and
equal balance, to which the religious books with which
she was familiar, probably contributed.
   </p><p>  The ill-concerted Insurrection, generally known as
 Sir Thomas Wyatt's Rebellion, was the immediate
 ground upon which Queen Mary and her Council resolved





<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>
on the destruction of Lady Jane Grey.  The
dislike of the people of England (especially the Londoners) to the proposed marriage of the Queen with
Philip II. of Spain, was the chief point of which Wyatt
and his party had taken advantage, for exciting discontent in different parts of England. Wyatt assembled a
large body of troops in Kent, which, although hastily
collected, assumed a formidable character, and, advancing
to meet the Royal Forces, commanded by the Duke of
Norfolk, near Rochester, defeated and dispersed them
after a short conflict, and marched to Gravesend, a post of
considerable importance for the command of the Thames
below London. From thence, after refusing the overtures made by the Council, and demanding arrogantly
the surrender of the Tower with the Queen within it, as
the only terms on which he would treat, Wyatt, instead
of crossing the river by boats and barges at Gravesend,
marched up the Kentish shore to Southwark, from whence
he cannonaded the Tower, with no result except that of
alarming the city, and enabling the Queen's troops to
assemble and make better preparations for resistance.
</p><p>    After some hours wasted in this idle bravado in
Southwark, Wyatt marched up the Surrey side of the
river to Kingston, which must have been, at that time,
the first practicable place for fording the Thames. The
now populous district through which he passed, by Wandsworth, Battersea, Wimbledon, &amp;c., was then a tract of
rough commons, with scarce any roads, and must have
been in winter a most harassing march. Notwithstanding
all difficulties, Wyatt and his army made their appearance



    <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>

at Temple Bar within twenty-four hours of their departure
from Southwark; but whether the men deserted on finding themselves unsupported as they entered Westminster
after this exhausting march, or were most of them dispersed by panic at the appearance of the preparations
to resist them, it is certain that Wyatt reached Temple
Bar with so few followers, that he was seized by a
party of the Royal Forces almost without a struggle,
and lodged in the Tower. Here he was received into
custody by the Lieutenant, Sir Thomas Bridges, who
with unmanly brutality took him by the collar, unarmed
as he stood, saying, " I would sticke thee through with
my dagger, but that the law must pass upon thee."
To which Wyatt in a dignified tone, and " with a grim
look at the Lieutenant," sternly rejoined, "It is no
maisterie now;" and passed on to the prison which
was to be his last abode. This danger once past, Mary
and her Council lost no time in the steps necessary
for the execution of Lady Jane Grey and her husband.
It has been said, on the authority of Fox's 'Acts and
Monuments,' that Mary entertained a personal aversion
to this young lady, on account of a conversation reported
to her, as having taken place with Lady Wharton, when
passing a Catholic chapel.  It seems Lady Wharton
made a curtsy to the consecrated wafer suspended over
the altar, when Lady Jane asked, " Did she believe the
Virgin Mary were there ? "  "No," said Lady Wharton,
"I made the obeisance to Him who made us all."
"How can that be," replied Lady Jane, " when we know
it was the baker who made that to which you paid
reverence ? "






<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>

 </p><p>   The trial of Lady Jane, if such it could be called,
had taken place before Wyatt's outbreak, and, had it
not been for his wild attempt on London and the
Tower, it has been supposed Mary would have spared
her life, and been content to keep her in close imprisonment; but those were not times when much scruple was
made of taking life of any one who might be regarded as
a pretender to the Crown. As if in mockery of the known
Protestant feelings of Lady Jane, Mary's Confessor,
Feckenham, was sent on the 8th of February to prepare
her for death, and to exhort her husband and her, to die
in the Catholic faith. Four days after this visit, was the
day fixed for their execution. Tower Hill was at first
intended for the fatal scene; but it was afterwards determined to behead them separately, for fear of the excitement which might be expected from so cruel a spectacle
as the simultaneous execution of two young and interesting persons only lately united in marriage.
  </p><p>   It was therefore determined that Lady Jane should
suffer on Tower Green (within the fortress), and Lord
Guildford Dudley upon the Hill, outside. Before his
death, he sent to her to desire a last interview, but
she entreated him to give up this wish, as liable to
produce feelings which might unfit them both for their
last hour. He consented to her wish, but begged she
would give him a token as he was to pass under the
window of " Partridge's house," where she had probably
been removed that morning from the Beauchamp Tower, to
make her preparations for death. Lord Guildford Dudley
was led out to Tower Hill, and suffered with all the
firmness and resignation which might be expected from




      <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

his blameless life and character. His body was placed
in a cart, covered with a cloth, and brought into the
Tower for burial in St. Peter's Chapel.
 </p><p>   As the cart passed under Lady Jane's window, she
discovered at once the form which the cloth thrown over it
but partially shrouded, and exclaimed, " Oh ! Guildford,
Guildford, the ante-past is not so bitter that thou hast
tasted, and which I shall soon taste, as to make my flesh
tremble; it is nothing compared to the feast we shall
partake this day in heaven."
  </p><p>  When Sir T. Bridges, the Lieutenant of the Tower,
appeared to conduct her to the block, she presented him
her tablets to keep in acknowledgment of his kindness to
her. Arrived on Tower Green, only a short distance from
her prison door, she addressed a few modest and simple
words to those present, to the effect that, although she
had most reluctantly accepted the short-lived dignity
forced upon her by the entreaties of her relations, she
freely admitted she had no real right to the crown, and
that the sentence therefore, under which she suffered, was
not an unjust one. Hollingshed's account of her end is
very touching.  " She prayed fervently, and then stood
up and gave to Mistress Ellen, her maid, her gloves and
handkerchief, and her book to Master Bridges, the
Lieutenant's brother, and so untied her gown.  The
executioner pressed to help her off with it; but she
desired him to let her alone, and turned toward her two
gentlewomen, who helped her off therewith, and with her
other attire, and gave her a fair handkerchief to put about
her eyes.  Then the executioner kneeled down and







<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>

asked her forgiveness, whom she forgave most willingly.
Then he willed her to stand upon the straw; which done,
she saw the block; and then she said, ' I pray you
despatch me quickly.' Then she kneeled down, saying,
' Will you take it off before I lay me down ?' Whereunto
the executioner answered, 'No, Madam.' Then tied
she the handkerchief about her eyes, and, feeling for the
block, she said, 'Where is it ? where is it ?' One of the
standers-by guided her thereunto, and she laid down her
head upon the block, and then stretched forth her body,
and said, ' Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit;' and
so finished her life, her head being struck off by a single
blow."
 </p><p>   Her body was interred with that of her husband under
the altar in St. Peter's Chapel. It has been mentioned
above that she was in " Partridge's house" when she gave
the token just before his execution to Lord Guildford
Dudley; and it may therefore be well to explain, that it
was not uncommon to remove prisoners of high rank
from the Beauchamp Tower, which was the usual state
prison, to the Lieutenant's or to one of the Warders'
quarters, in order to make their immediate preparation
for death, and more conveniently to receive and bid farewell to such friends and relations as were at the last
moment permitted to see and attend them to the scaffold.
  </p><p>  The word "Jane," inscribed on the north wall of the
Beauchamp Prison Tower, has been always attributed to
the hand of this unfortunate young lady, and there is no
reason to question it, any more than the inscriptions of
other prisoners upon those gloomy walls.  Bailey and




     <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>


others, who have taken a strange satisfaction in throwing
doubt upon traditions of the Tower, would have it believed,
that these names on the walls of the Beauchamp Prison,
were not really carved by the persons themselves; but a
cursory inspection will show, by the confused and irregular
way in which the names are scattered over the surface of
the interior, that they were evidently the chance work
of the prisoners, who sought by any means before them
to occupy their thoughts in some manual employment,
and perhaps at the same time to hand down their sorrows
to times, when that pity and compassion might be felt
for them, of which their relentless enemies or persecutors
were incapable.</p><p>

       <p> DURING the last years of Queen Mary's
           reign, Lady Catherine Grey, the younger
           sister of the unfortunate Lady Jane, had
           been residing, under the care of the
Duchess of Somerset, Lord Hertford's mother, at her
seat of Hanworth. Lord Hertford, who frequently visited
Hanworth, formed an attachment to Lady Catherine;
but as concealment was necessary from his mother, to
whose charge she was in fact confided, almost in the
position of a prisoner, it was to his sister, Lady Jane
Seymour, and to her only, that he made known the state
of his affections. The Duchess, perceiving, as he afterwards expressed it, "familiarity and good will between
them, did often admonish him to abstain from Lady
Catherine's company."  To these warnings he replied
that "young folks, meaning well, might well accompany
together, and that both in that house, and also in the
court, he trusted he might use her company, being not
forbidden by the Queen's Highness's express commandment." Beyond this remark, he never avowed to his
mother, or to any of his or Lady Catherine's relations
(except his sister), the secret understanding that subsisted



  <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

 between them. This secrecy was the natural consequence
 of the fear inspired by the harshness with which both
 Mary and Elizabeth had treated the branch of the Royal
 Family to which Lady Catherine belonged.
  </p><p>   Soon after the accession of Queen Elizabeth, Lady
Catherine Grey and Lady Jane Seymour were both of
them placed about the Queen's person, and in waiting
upon Her Majesty at Hampton Court.
   </p><p>  Lord Hertford, being at that time confined by indisposition to his house in Channon Row, Westminster,
wrote to his sister to ask her assistance in forwarding his
suit with her friend, and "to feel her disposition for
marriage with him."  Lady Jane executed this commission faithfully, but Lady Catherine declined to give
any positive answer, till the Queen should come to Westminster. As soon as the removal of the Court took place,
Lord Hertford obtained an interview with Lady Catherine,
in his sister's private apartments; and there, in her presence, he made a direct proposal of marriage.  Lady
Catherine answered, " that, weighing his long suit and good
will borne to her, she was content to marry him, the next
time that the Queen's Highness should go abroad and
leave her and Lady Jane behind her." They plighted their
faith "by giving one to the other their hands," Lady Jane
being present throughout the interview; and it was agreed
that their marriage should take place secretly at Lord
Hertford's house in Channon Row; but as the opportunity
depended on the movements of the Queen, no day could
be fixed. Lady Jane, however, undertook that a clergyman


<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>
should be ready at very short notice, whenever his
services might be required.
   </p><p> The opportunity occurred shortly before Christmas
of the year 1560, when the Queen went to Eltham
to hunt.  Within an hour after her departure, Lady
Jane Seymour and Lady Catherine Grey quitted the
Palace, and, descending the orchard stairs, proceeded
along " the sands " at low tide to the back of the Earl's
house in Channon Row. They had not been able to give
him previous warning; but as he knew they only waited
for the opportunity of the Queen's departure, which was
generally known to those about the Court, he was ready
to receive them. The Minister with whom Lady Jane
had previously agreed for the purpose, was quickly summoned, and brought with him the Book of Common
Prayer. Lord Hertford and Lady Catherine Grey were
then married, "with such words and ceremonies, and
in that order, as it is there set forth, he placing a ring
containing five links of gold on her finger, as directed by
the Minister."
   </p><p>  This clergyman's name was unfortunately never ascertained by either Lord Hertford or Lady Catherine,
though both afterwards affirmed they should know
him again if they saw him, and agreed in describing
him as "a man of middling stature, fair complexion,
auburn hair and beard, and middle age, dressed in a
plain long gown of black cloth faced with 'budge,' and
a falling collar to the same, such a one as the ministers
used when they came out of Germany." The ceremony


     <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>

over, Lord Hertford thanked the unknown Minister, and
Lady Jane dismissed him with a fee of 10L. for his
services. (Though ready enough to earn this liberal
reward for his performance of the ceremony, it was no
wonder that this Minister, whoever he was, took advantage of the entire secrecy afforded by the early death
of Lady Jane, and declined to come forward and vouch
for the marriage when it was question of braving the
terrible wrath of Elizabeth.) After the ceremony, Lord
Hertford accompanied Lady Catherine and his sister to
the water stairs, where he took an affectionate leave of
his bride, and the two ladies returned by boat to the
Palace, " to Master Comptroller's chambers, whom they
found ready to go to dinner" by the time they arrived.
Many clandestine interviews took place afterwards between the newly married pair, but they still kept their
marriage secret.
   </p><p> Whether Lord Hertford thought that by absenting
himself awhile on the Continent, any suspicions would be
avoided, or that he had other reasons, he resolved, soon
after the marriage, to ask the Queen's leave to go abroad.
Lady Jane, to whom alone he confided this intention,
imparted it in confidence to her sister-in-law, and the
sight of his passport, which soon after accidentally met
Lady Catherine's eye, left no doubt of his intention;
which was, as she afterwards expressed herself, "of no
small grief and trouble unto her."
 </p><p>   But a greater cause of anxiety now arose; and she was
obliged to impart to Lady Jane and to her husband her
fears that she was likely to become a mother. Lady Jane,







<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>
with that decision which marked her conduct throughout
this perilous transaction, told her at once "that, if it
were so, there was no remedy but be acknown how
the matter stood, and that they must abide it, and trust
to the Queen's mercy." To the necessity of this avowal
Lord Hertford also agreed, and promised his wife that,
if her suspicions proved true, he would not depart the
realm; but the unhappy Lady Catherine, young, inexperienced, and timid, seems to have been afraid of speaking confidently on the subject; and Lord Hertford,
availing himself of the Queen's leave, sailed for France.
 </p><p>    On the 19th of March, 1560-1, Lady Jane Seymour
unfortunately died at the early age of nineteen. Unsupported by the presence of her husband, or comforted by
the affection and counsels of her friend and sister-in-law,
Lady Catherine found herself in a few months reduced to
the humiliation of confessing that which could no longer
be concealed, and of bearing alone the brunt of the
Queen's displeasure. "About six days before Lord Hertford's departure beyond the seas, he did conceive and
devise a writing with his own hand in parchment, sealed
and signed with his own hand," of which the object
was to secure to his wife 1000L. per annum in case of his
death. This writing he had delivered into her hands,
but no other person was privy to the transaction. It
certainly showed some consideration for her; but Lord
Hertford's conduct in originally seeking her hand in
secret, in risking the safety of his young sister, by imposing on her the dangerous responsibility of making the
arrangements for their marriage, and still more in his



    <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>

quitting England, and leaving his wife exposed to the
risk of braving, alone, the consequences of that union
which he had induced her to form, certainly betrayed
a selfishness, which, later in life, was manifested by his
harsh conduct towards both his son and his grandson.
  </p><p>  It was in the beginning of August that Lady Catherine determined to declare the whole truth to Mrs. St.
Lo, a lady of the Queen's privy chamber, afterwards
notorious as " Bess of Hardwick."  Her confidence was
received with friendly sympathy by that lady, who wept
bitterly on hearing her tale, and expressed her sorrow
"that the Queen's Majesty had not been privy thereunto." The following night (August 10th) Lady Catherine, acting under Mrs. St. Lo's advice, resolved on trying to interest the compassion of Lord Robert Dudley,
afterwards Earl of Leicester, already in great favour
with the Queen.  She visited his bedside (he was ill
at the time), and, telling him her story, implored his
services, to obtain the Queen's mercy. He consented
to intercede with the Queen. But neither the sympathy
of Mrs. St. Lo, nor the good offices of Lord Robert,
availed with the hard nature of Elizabeth. Lady Catherine was at once committed to the Tower, and there
closely examined by the Lord Treasurer and others,
respecting the circumstances of her marriage. On the
21st of September her first child was born.
  </p><p>  Whether Lord Hertford was immediately informed
of her imprisonment, does not appear; but as she
acknowledged, in one of her examinations, that she had
acquainted her husband by letter of the certainty of






<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>
her situation, it may be hoped that his return to England
in the month of her expected confinement was dictated
by the wish to be with her, at a time when, not only her
life might be in danger, but when her honour might also
be called in question. On his landing at Dover in the
beginning of September, he was at once arrested by
Mr. Crispe, the Captain of the Castle, who showed him
the Queen's commission, by which he was charged to
bring the Earl immediately to Court; his servants were
not to be allowed to accompany him, but were to follow
him to Londom.
  </p><p>  On the 5th September he was committed to the
Tower, and on the 12th examined before the Lord
Treasurer. On the 13th February, 1561-2, both he and
Lady Catherine were again examined before Commissioners; and on the 12th of May, in the Bishop of
London's Palace; the result being that the marriage was
declared null and void. This commission was composed
of Parker Archbishop of Canterbury, Grindal Bishop of
London, Sir William Petre, and some others.
   </p><p>  A decision which could only be grounded on the
difficulty of procuring timely evidence of the truth of
their statements, was not likely to affect the sentiments
of the parties themselves respecting the validity of their
marriage; and after a time, by persuasion or corruption of
their keepers, the doors of their prison were no longer
secured against each other, and the birth of a second
child rekindled the anger of Elizabeth. A double fine was
imposed on Lord Hertford, and their imprisonment was
made so much stricter, that there is reason to suppose




              <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>

they never met again. Sir Edward Warner, the Lieutenant of the Tower, was at the same time dismissed for
his negligence in the custody of his charge.
 </p><p> Many letters and petitions were addressed both to Sir
William Cecil and to the Queen, in behalf of Lady
Catherine, by her uncle, Lord John Grey of Pirgo, and
by herself, but the only mercy extended to her and her
husband, was during the time when the plague raged in
London, and when a thousand in a week were said to
die of that malady. Then, in the month of August, 1563,
Lord Hertford was delivered (but in the condition of
a prisoner) to the custody of his mother, and Lady
Catherine to that of her uncle, Lord John Grey, at Pirgo,
where she was ordered to be maintained at the expense
of her husband.
  </p><p>  In January, 1565-6, and again in April, 1566, Anne,
Duchess of Somerset, addressed letters to Sir William
Cecil, praying for the release of her son, begging his
helping hand "to end this tedious suit," and urging
"how unmeet it is this young couple should thus wax old
in prison, and how far better it were for them to be
abroad, and learn to serve Her Majesty."
 </p><p>   These appeals were fruitless; and the following year
death released the ill-fated Lady Catherine from the
sorrows and humiliations to which she had been so heartlessly subjected.  She had been for some time in the
custody of Sir Owen Hopton, and died at his country
house, Cockfield Hall, in Yoxford, Suffolk.  There is
an account preserved of her last hours which contains
some pathetic details of the resignation and courage,




<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>
worthy a sister of Lady Jane Grey, with which she prepared for her end.
  </p><p>  When it is remembered that, at the time of her persecution of this unhappy young lady, Elizabeth was but
twenty-five years of age, and had herself so recently
endured the bitterness of imprisonment, we cannot but
wonder at the severity and harshness which disfigured
her naturally noble nature, and led her to actions of
cruelty and tyranny unworthy of so great and illustrious
a Queen.</p>

     <p> AMONG the numerous committals in Elizabeth's reign, were those of Hickey and
           Barry, the "Harbinger" and " Steward" of
           Gerald, the eleventh Earl of Kildare, for
the murder of the two Keatings in Ireland. The story
affords a fearful picture of the barbarity and contempt of
law and justice, which then prevailed in that country;
but what appears so strange in the matter is, that the
Queen, or her councillors, should have thought it worth
while to incur all the expence and trouble of bringing
over to London such subordinate miscreants as Hickey
and Barry, instead of causing them to be executed at
once, near the spot where their crimes were committed,
to serve as an example to their comrades, which their
removal to London must have rendered almost nugatory.
  </p><p>  The Earl of Kildare was, it appears, in the habit
of keeping up a frequent, though secret, communication
with the chiefs of the petty insurrections, which were
always smouldering within the English pale, and these
Keatings, who were agents and spies of the rebel chiefs,
were occasionally received by him as guests at his castle







<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>

of Kilkea, the residence of the Marquis of Kildare, for
whose occupation the present Duke of Leinster repaired
and restored this ancient stronghold of the FitzGerald
family.
   </p><p> 1574.-Being desirous of courting the favour of the
Lord Deputy (Sir W. Fitzwilliam), the Earl, by a base and
unworthy deception, invited the brothers Keating to his
castle, under a safe-conduct, as he had often done before,
and, after causing them to be hospitably entertained, by
his dependants and servants, allowed Shan, the elder
brother, to depart upon the faith and security of his
usual " protection or safe-conduct." The Earl afterwards
declared that the safe-conduct was only to enable the
Keatings to come to his castle in safety, but contained
no engagement as to equal safety after their departure.
  </p><p>   On this base pretext, he despatched Hickey, his harbinger, and his steward, Barry, accompanied by another
ruffian, to waylay Shan Keating, whom they overtook in
a lonely spot, where the road led through a dreary bog.
It would seem that the unfortunate man at once guessed
their errand, for, as soon as he saw them, he dismounted
from the " stout black horse" which he rode, and drawing
his sword, boldly faced his assailants. They had made
up their minds, however, to all hazards, and at once fell
upon him, and after a desperate combat, in which, but
for the odds of three to one, it is probable his courage
might have saved his life, they eventually threw him
to the ground, covered with wounds, and, cutting off
his head, carried it back to the Earl, who immediately
forwarded the ghastly offering to Dublin Castle, as a



  <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>

proof to the Lord Deputy of his zeal for the Queen's
service.
  </p><p>  Meyler Keating, the brother of Shan, and his fellow
guest at Kilkea, remained meantime feasting unsuspiciously in the castle, when the Earl, on the following night,
ordered Hickey and Barry to decoy him out into the
demesne, despatch him, and cut off his head, as they had
served his brother, which these unscrupulous wretches
performed, without hesitation, and Meyler's head was
sent as a second tribute of loyalty to Sir W. Fitzwilliam
in Dublin.
  </p><p>  The Deputy endeavoured to disclaim having given
the Earl any authority or encouragement to commit these
acts of cruelty and treachery, but the Earl, when on his
trial, quoted a letter of his, which, if it did not convey any
direct order, certainly would bear the interpretation by
which he attempted to justify the act.
   </p><p> Whether Fitzwilliam really did write the letter produced by the Earl, in his justification, or whether he was
ashamed to confess to any share in these savage murders,
it is certain that Hickey and Barry were sent to England,
imprisoned in the Tower, and tried and executed for
their crimes.
   </p><p> Such, however, was the devotion of Hickey to his
Lord, that, when interrogated with a view to bring to
light other deeds of violence laid to the charge of the
Earl, he said, the only illegal act he could remember of
his master's, was the cutting off a man's nose, " which
certainly was not to be liked;" but then the man was




<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>

believed to have stolen some of the deer from the demesne
of Kilkea !
  </p><p>  Upon the subsequent inquiry by a Commission, into
the conduct of the Earl, who was brought to London
under an escort (the expense of his journey as a prisoner
was no less than 400L.), a list of interrogatories was given
him to answer or refute. These questions, and the Earl's
replies, are preserved in original, and show the wonderful
shrewdness, with which he applied himself to his defence,
in which he so far succeeded, as to escape the fate of the
two wretches, who, at his direct instigation and command,
committed the perfidious murders of Shan and Meyler
Keating.</p>

     <p>   PHILIP  HOWARD, Earl of Arundel (called
           by this, his minor title, on account of the
           attainder of the Duke of Norfolk, his
      father), was one of the most unfortunate of
men.   Queen Elizabeth restored him in blood about
1580, and for a short time he enjoyed her favour, and
was among the gayest of the Queen's courtiers; but
the Earl of Leicester caused him to be accused of conspiracy, and in 1584 he received an order to confine
himself to his own house; his real offence in the Queen's
eyes being his reconciliation to the Roman Catholic faith.
As no act of treason could be charged against him, he
was shortly liberated, but his distrust of the Queen, and
the daily severities exercised by her upon those who
adhered to the Romish faith, induced him to take steps
for flying the country. Before doing so, he, however,
resolved to write a full justification of his conduct to the
Queen, which was to have been delivered as soon as he
should make known to his friends in England that he
had reached a place of safety on the Continent. By
some mistake or treachery, his letter fell into the hands
of Secretary Walsingham, before he had effected his intended



<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>

flight, and, being betrayed by his attendant, he
was seized, when on the point of embarking on the
Sussex coast, and at once thrown into the Tower.
Charges, as groundless as the former ones, were now
brought against him, and, after a very unfair trial before
the Star Chamber, he was fined 10,000L., and sentenced
to imprisonment during the Queen's pleasure.
 </p><p>   While he lay prisoner in the Tower, the Spanish
Armada arrived in the Channel (1588), on which event
he had the imprudence (as asserted by his enemies) to
express his joy and hopes of freedom, and even to have
caused masses to be said for the success of the Spaniards,
by a priest who was brought to him in disguise. Fresh
charges of high treason were now framed against him,
one of which was, an intention of serving under the
Prince of Parma, against England; and although he
ably defended himself, and proved the falsehood of all
the accusations against him, except his adhesion to the
Roman Catholic faith, he received sentence of death.
   </p><p>  This barbarous condemnation seems, however, to
 have been only intended as a pretence for his perpetual
 imprisonment, since it was never carried into execution.
 After he had been some time in the Tower, he petitioned
 the Queen that his newly married wife might visit him;
 or at all events, that he might be allowed the sight of his
 infant son, born since his imprisonment.  Both these
 favours were cruelly refused by Elizabeth, and he continued to languish in his solitary prison for several years.
 He sent in, however, a second petition, and it was said
 that the Queen not only offered to grant it, but to release




   <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>

him altogether, if he would renounce the Roman Catholic
faith. This he had the resolution and constancy to
refuse, and died in 1595, worn out with sorrow and the
severe exercises of religious penance, to which he latterly
devoted himself, in the fortieth year of his age; his
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather having perished
on the scaffold, by a far more merciful destiny. His
name is roughly inscribed over the chimney of the
Beauchamp Tower. He was buried in the Tower graveyard, but afterwards removed, in 1624, to Arundel, where,
on opening a vault in 1777, his coffin was discovered,
with an inscription in Latin, describing his unhappy
fate, and adding that it was suspected that his death
had been hastened by poison; but of this suspicion
there is no historical record; nor was it likely that
Elizabeth would thus have taken the life of an almost
forgotten prisoner, who, after so many years' seclusion
from the world, could by no possibility conspire, or cabal,
against either her throne or life, even had it been in his
nature to enter into any such designs, whereas there
never was a man more unfit or unequal to take a leading
part in such affairs--still less is it likely, that his conscience would have allowed him to lend his hand to the
murder even of his bitterest enemy.</p>

     <p>    THE Gunpowder Plot is a subject on which
   so much has been written, and of which
            such various versions have been given by
            historians, that most readers will be acquainted with the principal actors and events of that
extraordinary conspiracy; but the arrest and examinations of Guy Fawkes and his associates are matters so
connected with Tower History, that it will not be proper
to pass the subject, without entering into the question of
the origin of the plot, and giving a general account of it,
gleaned from the sources which appear the most interesting, as well as the most authentic.
  </p><p>  Among the most bigoted of the great Roman Catholic
party in England, great disappointment had been felt on
discovering that James I. had no intention, after his
accession, of changing the Protestant character of the late
Queen's government.
  </p><p>  Meetings and consultations of a treasonable kind
had been privately held in London. Catesby, a gentleman
of good family (descended from Richard III.'s faithful
follower), took a leading part in these meetings, and in
truth was much more the leader of the conspiracy than



       <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>

 Guy Fawkes himself. Catesby had been a profligate in
 his youth, but later in life had turned his mind to religious
 questions, and had changed from the Roman Catholic
 to the Protestant religion; but after reverting to his old
 courses, and spending the remainder of his estate, had
 again returned to Romanism in its most bigoted form.
   </p><p>  Catesby had taken so leading a part in Essex's insurrection that he narrowly escaped with life, and had been
 fined 3000L. on his release from arrest. It was he who
 first conceived the scheme of blowing up the King and
 Parliament. Thomas Winter, a gallant soldier who had
 served the Dutch against the Spaniards, but gave up his
 commission from religious scruples, and John Wright,
 a gentleman of family, were his earliest confidants, the
 former of whom went over to Flanders, with the object of
 enlisting into the conspiracy some officers of spirit and
 daring, who might lead the outbreak. Guido or Guy
 Fawkes, a Yorkshire gentleman, who had squandered a
 small estate in Yorkshire and entered the Spanish service,
 appears to have been the only one of the English
 officers, serving in the Low Countries, who acceded to
 Winter's proposals, and returned with him to London,
 in April, 1604, ready for some desperate undertaking for
 the overthrow of the government, and assassination of
 the King.
  </p><p>  Being a bold daring man, possessed of some military
skill and experience, and deeply imbued with attachment
to the Romish faith, Fawkes infused fresh spirit and
resolution into the conspiracy. Thomas Percy, a kinsman
of the Earl of Northumberland, who had given him a







<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>

halbert in the Yeomen of the Guard, was another leading
character in the conspiracy. He like Fawkes had been
a profligate in his youth, and, suddenly changing his
habits, was now become a fanatic of the most violent
opinions. It was Percy who had been employed by the
Catholic party, shortly before Elizabeth's decease, on a
mission to James, while yet in Scotland, to ascertain that
monarch's views as to the Reformed doctrines; and the
wary King having from policy led him to believe he
would support the Catholic party, his indignation and
fury against James, for the manner in which he had been
deceived, knew no bounds.
  </p><p>   So active was the part taken by the Roman Catholics
to insure the peaceable succession of James, that, immediately on Elizabeth's death, Sir Thomas Tresham,
father of Francis, the conspirator, proclaimed the King
at Northampton, with some danger to himself, from the
excitement of the Protestant population; while his sons
Lewis and Francis, and his son-in-law Lord Monteagle,
were energetic assistants to the Earl of Southampton, on
the occasion of his prompt occupation of the Tower, in
the new King's name.
   </p><p>  This Francis, like many other of the conspirators,
 had been a leading man in Essex's insurrection, and was
 one of those who had been placed on guard in Essex
 House, over the Lord Keeper, Lord Chief Justice, and
 other noblemen, during the short time Essex held them
 in durance.
   </p><p>  After binding themselves to secrecy and action, by
 terrible oaths, which they confirmed by taking the Sacrament


     <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>

together, the conspirators proceeded to examine
the localities of the Houses of Parliament, with a view to
lay their plan. By a remarkable chance, the house adjoining the Parliament House was untenanted. Percy at
once hired it of one Ferris, and, Fawkes's military knowledge being brought into play, a mine was commenced,
by which it was expected to effect a passage through the
foundation wall, under the House of Parliament.  But
this undertaking proved more arduous than it at first
appeared, for the wall was no less than nine feet in
thickness, and built of the hardest materials.
  </p><p>  Not to excite suspicion, Winter, John Wright, and
Percy, with a few others (seven gentlemen of name and
blood as Fawkes emphatically called them in his examinations), were charged with this part of the work. They
daily carried down into the vault hard eggs, baked meat,
and other durable provision, on which to support themselves, instead of going out to make daily purchases in the
market, which might have drawn attention to Ferris's
house.
  </p><p>   It is almost incredible with what energy these
infatuated men persevered in the severe labour of their
underground operations, often working by turns through
the whole of the night. So extreme was their superstition, that, when some strange sounds were heard in the
direction in which they were slowly, but steadily, advancing, they were in the habit, as was afterwards confessed by one of the party, of obtaining from a priest
some holy water, with which to sprinkle the sides and
bottom of the mine, and persuaded themselves that this





<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>

caused the strange sounds to cease.  The stones and
rubbish which they excavated, were carefully spread from
day to day, in small quantities, over the surface of a
garden in rear of the house.
  </p><p>  Contrary to their expectations, the Parliament,
instead of meeting this winter (1604), was prorogued to
October of next year, upon learning which, they agreed
to separate for a month, and to look out for fresh
adherents.  In February, 1605, they reassembled, and
were proceeding with their underground labour, when
a noise was heard over their heads, which they discovered, on investigation, was caused by the removal
of a quantity of coal, by the tenant of a cellar several
feet above the level of their mine, and therefore immediately below the floor of the Parliament House.
This discovery greatly facilitated their plans, and made
further labour in the mine unnecessary. They at once
hired the coal-cellar in Percy's name, and began transferring into it a quantity of gunpowder which they had
accumulated in a lone house at Lambeth, to be brought
across the river when occasion offered. Upon the barrels
of powder, they heaped pieces of iron, crowbars, and all
the tools they had used in mining, and then covered the
whole with billets and faggots, to avoid any suspicious
appearance.
  </p><p>  As it was from the first intended, that the blowing up
of Parliament was to be the prelude of a general insurrection, it now became necessary to provide a store of arms,
and ammunition; with a view to which, Catesby gave
out that he had a commission to raise a troop of horse in



       <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>

London, for the Spanish service; and as he had the full
confidence of the other conspirators, he now intrusted
the project to several Catholic gentlemen of substance,
in order to obtain funds for carrying on the plot.  Sir
Everard Digby, Ambrose Rookwood, and Francis
Tresham, were accordingly admitted into the secret.
Meantime the meeting of Parliament was further put off
to the 5th November, against which day all the plans of
the conspirators were now nearly matured. The great
risk was the actual firing of the powder, and this was
undertaken by Fawkes, who was familiar with such
operations in the wars of the Low Countries, and conversant with the preparations for exploding mines. He
prepared a slow match, which he calculated to last exactly
a quarter of an hour, thus affording him time to run to
the river-side, and embark in a small vessel ready to sail
down the Thames with the ebb tide, and convey him to
Flanders. Now this part of the plan is somewhat difficult
to explain, because, if the conspirators believed that the
people would readily join them immediately after the
explosion, the natural thing would have been for Fawkes
to have appeared at once at the head of the conspirators
as their military leader, and to have directed the seizure
and occupation of the Tower, and other important points
of the city, by the mob and such partisans as they were
confident would assemble and join them.  This too
would have been in combination with the arrangements
for the outbreak in the midland counties, where Digby,
on the day of the opening of Parliament, was to collect a
large party of Catholic partisans and adherents (many of







<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>

whom were to be kept ignorant of his intentions till the
last moment), on the pretext of a great hunting meet at
Dunchurch, in Warwickshire.
   </p><p>  As soon as they should get the news of the destruction of the King and Parliament, by expresses from
London laid along the road, these persons were to detach
some men of resolution to seize the person of the Princess
Elizabeth (afterwards Queen of Bohemia), then residing
at Lord Harrington's house, near Coventry, and proclaim
her Queen. Perhaps there is no part of this wild and
desperate scheme so unaccountable, or so at variance
with the general views and objects of the conspiracy,
as this plan for placing the young Elizabeth upon the
throne. The tender age of the princess would of course
render her a mere puppet in their hands; but what
reasonable expectation could they entertain of the country
submitting to the nominal government of a child, under
the direction of the destroyers of every other member of
the Royal Family ? Although up to this period the conspirators seem to have acted with great unanimity, a
discussion arose, as the time drew near, on the question
of warning the Catholic Peers and Members of the
House of Commons to absent themselves from Parliament, and thus save their lives, in some way which would
not make them acquainted with the conspiracy.
  </p><p>  Catesby, and the more violent of the party, had no
scruples on this subject, compared with the risk of the
secret transpiring; but the greater number, who had
friends and connections among the Peers and Members,
were strongly in favour of some attempt to warn and


        <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>

save them. The Lords Stourton and Monteagle were
married to sisters of Francis Tresham, who recoiled
with horror from sacrificing such near relatives, when a
word might preserve their lives.  But a deaf ear was
turned to his entreaties and remonstrances, and there
can be little doubt that he then resolved on the anonymous warning, which eventually led to the discovery of
the plot.
   </p><p> The other person to whom the information has been
attributed was Mrs. Habington, a sister of Lord Monteagle,
whose husband was the owner of Hendlip House, where
Garnet was eventually arrested after many days' concealment; but certainly Francis Tresham was the person to
whom the conspirators themselves attributed the warning.
It was about ten days before the day appointed for Parliament to assemble, when Lord Monteagle, son of the Earl
of Morley (a Catholic nobleman, and a Peer in right of
his mother, the daughter and heiress of Stanley Lord
Monteagle), received an anonymous letter delivered by a
stranger to one of his servants, who brought it to him
while at supper, with some guests, at his house near
London.   This house was either at Hoxton, or near
Barking (where a ruinous mansion still exists, converted
into a farmhouse, and said to have belonged to him).
The letter ran thus :-
  </p><p>  " My Lord, out of the love I bear to some of your
friends, I have a care for your preservation. Therefore I
would advise you, as you tender your life, to devise some
excuse, to shift off your attendance at this Parliament,
for God and man have concurred, to punish the wickedness






<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>

of this time. And think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself into your country, where you
may expect the event in safety. For though there be
no appearance of any stir, yet I say they will receive a
terrible blow this Parliament, and yet they shall not see
who hurts them. This counsel is not to be contemned;
because it may do you good, and can do you no harm,
for the danger is past, as soon as you have burnt the
letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make
good use of it, into whose holy protection I commend
you."
  </p><p>  Monteagle was much puzzled by this mysterious
letter, especially at the expression " the danger is past as
soon as you have burnt the letter."  Though he was not
actually alarmed, he knew himself to be somewhat under
a cloud, from the part he had taken in Essex's insurrection,
and thought best to take the letter at once to the Secretary of State (Lord Salisbury).  His house, either at
Barking or Hoxton, was not above seven miles from
Whitehall, yet it took him four hours to ride there, in
such a state were the roads, or rather tracks, in the
vicinity of London at that period.
   </p><p>  Lord Salisbury, though he did not attach much consequence to the letter, yet deemed it his duty to take
the first opportunity of laying it before the King, who
was then on a hunting party at Royston, but returned to
Whitehall about a week before Parliament was to meet,
and being shown the letter, immediately summoned a
council to consider its extraordinary contents.
  </p><p>  James was just the man to interest himself in a




    <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>

mystery, and he set to work over Monteagle's letter,
weighing and pondering the strange ambiguous terms
in which it was worded, with his usual inquisitive diligence. The terrible blow to be struck by unseen hands,
the greatness and suddenness of the threatened danger,
struck the King as applicable only to gunpowder. It
appears indeed very natural that the dreadful death of
Darnley, his own father, by the blowing up of the house at
the Kirk of Field, may have directed his thoughts immediately to that suspicion. Orders were privately issued
for the Earl of Suffolk (Lord Chamberlain) to cause a
careful search to be made under the Houses of Parliament,
delaying this, however, till the last day before the opening
of the session, in order to avoid giving any alarm.
   </p><p> Accordingly on the afternoon of the 4th November,
Lord Suffolk, accompanied by Lord Monteagle and a few
friends, and attended by a guard, went to the Parliament
House, and made a general inspection of all the premises,
but especially the cellars below. They saw Fawkes in
the coal-cellar, but, as there were many other persons
standing about in the passages and other cellars, they
took no notice of him at the moment.
  </p><p>  But after night had closed in, and all seemed quiet,
Sir Thomas Knyvett, an active magistrate, with several
armed constables, proceeded, quietly and silently (under
the pretence of searching for some furniture which had
been abstracted from the King's wardrobe), to the cellar,
where Fawkes had been seen in the morning. They
met him just as he was quitting his charge for the






<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>
night, and closing the door. He was instantly seized and
searched, as well as every part of the cellar, when, on
removal of the billets and faggots, no less than thirty-six
barrels of powder appeared, with the tools, iron bars, &amp;c.,
before mentioned, carefully piled upon them. On Fawkes
himself, some slow-match was found, but no weapon or
papers.
 </p><p> He was at once taken before the Council, which had
already been summoned, though it was near midnight.
He did not attempt to deny his guilt; but when urged
to name his accomplices, he preserved an obstinate
silence, and was committed that same night to the
Tower.
  </p><p>  Next morning, as soon as the seizure of Fawkes
became known, most of the conspirators fled from London
in all haste. Some sought the first concealment which
offered, but the more determined bent their course for
Dunchurch, the rendezvous, before mentioned, of those
who were appointed to follow and second Sir E. Digby in
the proposed attempt to obtain possession of the person
of the Princess. Great consternation prevailed among
them, when the news was brought of Fawkes's arrest to
Dunchurch; but Catesby, nothing daunted by the danger,
collected a number of the boldest, who mounted their
horses, and made for Holbeach, a strong mansion of Mr.
Stephen Littleton's, about four miles from Stourbridge, in
Staffordshire, where he hoped to collect some malcontents
from the Welsh border. On mustering at Holbeach, they
found their number reduced to less than sixty men,




         <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>

several having deserted them on the road; but as all
hope of escape was now gone, they commenced fortifying
the house, and prepared to perish rather than surrender.
 </p><p>   Their first steps were to put in order what arms
they had collected, to block up the lower windows,
barricade the outer doors, and take precautions against
the danger of their assailants forcing them out, by setting the outhouses and stables on fire. Many of these
desperate men had seen enough of foreign war to guide
them in adopting the best means for defence; but so
reckless were some of the party, that, as was afterwards
elicited on their trials, " having spread out two or three lbs.
of powder to dry in a platter, before a large fire, and
underset the said platter with a great linen bag full of
more powder fifteen or sixteen lbs., it so fell out that one
coming to put more wood on the fire, and casting it on,
there fell a coal into the platter, whereat the powder,
taking fire, blew up, scorching Catesby, Grant, and
Rookwood, and blowing off part of the roof.  The linen
bag which was set under the platter, being suddenly
carried up through the breach, fell down in the courtyard,
whole and unfired, which, had it taken fire in the room,
would have slain them all outright."
  </p><p>   Not discouraged by this mischance, they continued
to make active preparations for defence, and when, on the
8th, the sheriff presented himself with the " posse comitatus" of the county, and a number of well-armed followers, they rejected his summons to surrender, flew to
their posts, and opposed a gallant resistance to the assault
which instantly took place.  But the assailants soon







<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>

forced their way into the courtyard, where Catesby and
Percy, who fought back to back, were struck down by
the same shot, which passed through both their bodies,
killing Catesby outright, Percy surviving till next day.
Thomas Winter, the two Wrights, and Rookwood, being
wounded and struck down, were taken prisoners, to
undergo the terrible fate they had so desperately striven
to avoid.
   </p><p>  Tresham, who had ventured to stay in London, and,
affecting entire innocence, to appear as usual in public,
soon became an object of suspicion to the Government.
On the 12th he was arrested and sent to the Tower, but
did not live to be brought to trial, being attacked by an
illness, during which his unfortunate wife was allowed to
attend and nurse him, but which carried him off a
fortnight after his committal.
  </p><p>   It has been asserted that Fawkes, after three days of
sullen silence, made on the 8th November, of his own
free will, a full confession of the whole scheme of the
conspiracy (saving only the names of his comrades).
There is a room in the Governor's house at the Tower,
generally known as the Council Chamber, where a large
marble tablet, let into the wall, commemorates the names
of the Council, and of the leaders of the plot, with other
details. The tradition has always existed, that in this
chamber Fawkes was examined by the Council, and underwent the application of the rack in its severest form;
indeed, so generally was this tradition received in the
Tower, that not many years ago the servants of the Major
of the Tower, the occupant of this house, were extremely



       <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>

reluctant to enter this apartment after dark, and more
than one sentry has declared he had heard terrible groans
proceeding from the window of this ominous chamber.
 </p><p>   From the determined courage of Fawkes, it might
be reasonably inferred that he would endure any torture
rather than confess; but experience has shown the fearful
power of pain to extort even false declarations from
persons exposed to the barbarous extremities of torture.
A few days after the seizure of Fawkes, the wretched
men taken at Holbeach, some of them badly wounded,
were brought to London, and examined separately for
several days. In consequence of supposed admissions
from them, Garnet, the principal of the English Jesuits,
with Gerard and Greenway, two others of the fraternity,
were proclaimed, and rewards were offered for their
capture.
   </p><p> The trials of the conspirators proceeded, and, the
usual sentence of treason being passed, Digby, R. Winter,
Grant, and Bates were executed on the 27th, in St. Paul's
Churchyard, and the following day, Fawkes, Rookwood,
Keyes, and Thomas Winter were executed in Palace
Yard, with all the horrible details which followed on the
sentence for high treason.
  </p><p>  As the awful procession passed along the Strand,
Rookwood perceived his wife, a lady of beauty and
merit, at a window, and called to her, as he lay on the
hurdle, to pray for him. She replied, in a clear voice,
"I will, I will; and do you offer yourself with a good
heart to your Creator. I yield you to Him, with as full







<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>
an assurance that you will be accepted of Him, as when
He gave you to me!"
   </p><p>  Gerard, being found impenetrably silent under verbal
examination, was barbarously tortured by suspension
from a hook in the wall, by the wrists, till he fainted.
Vinegar was poured down his throat to revive him,
and the same cruel torment was again applied to
him; but on his again swooning with the agony, Sir W.
Waad, the Lieutenant of the Tower (" that villain
Waad," as Raleigh called him), hard and brutal as he
was, refused to allow the torture to be repeated. Gerard
being afterwards negligently guarded, on the supposition
of his weakness from the torture he had endured, escaped
with Greenway, and got safe to Holland.
  </p><p>   Garnet had fled for concealment to Hendlip, the
country house of Mr. Habington, a Roman Catholic
gentleman, near Worcester. Sir H. Bromley, the sheriff
of the county, having received positive information that
he was there, surrounded the house with a number of
armed men, and commenced a strict search through the
building; but Habington's house, like many others in
those precarious times, was provided with such ingeniously contrived retreats, that the task proved extremely
difficult, and walls, wainscot, and partitions without number,
were broken through in the search, without success, till,
on the fourth day of the search, two wretched creatures,
Owen and Chambers, emerged from a secret door in the
wainscot of the long gallery, and gave themselves up;
having had but a single apple for their sustenance, during




        <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>

 the whole time of their concealment. Owen, after committal to the Tower, escaped a dreadful death on the
 scaffold, by suicide. Indeed, it appears that a certain
 torture, applied to him for a very short time on his first
 examination, drove him to this act, from sheer terror of
 its repetition in a severer form.
    </p><p> Encouraged by the capture of these men, the sheriff
 and his followers continued breaking down partitions,
 and searching the large open chimneys of the mansion
 at Hendlip, till, on the 8th day, a recess concealed in a
 chimney by a plank covered with mortar and soot, was
 discovered, from which Garnet the Jesuit, and Oldcorn
 his companion, were dragged out. They had had time
 to lay in some store of provision when they first betook
 themselves to their hiding-place, besides which broth and
 caudle had been ingeniously conveyed to them by a reed
 passed through a very small aperture higher up in the
chimney, from the sleeping-room of a lady of the family,
which scanty supply had enabled them thus to sustain
life for so many days.
   </p><p>  They were brought to the Tower, where, by James's
 order, they were tolerably well treated; but subjected
 to endless separate examinations, the King taking great
 interest in framing subtle questions himself, by which he
 expected to entrap and entangle them in their answers.
  </p><p>   Among other devices, Garnet and Oldcorn were
 placed in adjoining cells, with persons concealed behind
 the walls, to listen and take notes of the conversation
 which might pass between them.
  </p><p>    When their trial came on, although Garnet's line of







<pb id="p.130" n="130"/>
defence was to deny everything, till actually proved
against him, yet sufficient was elicited by cross-examination, and by the device above-mentioned of listening
informants, to satisfy the Council that Catesby had made
Garnet privy to the plot, several months before the
meeting of Parliament; chiefly, as it seemed, to obtain
from him certain religious sedatives for his conscience,
especially as to the question, so long disputed among the
conspirators, of how far it would be lawful to sacrifice
some Catholic Peers and innocent persons in the general
destruction of the Parliament.
   </p><p> The trial of Garnet was conducted with the most
scandalous disregard of reason and justice, the Crown
prosecutor appearing to consider invective and abuse
of the prisoner better arguments against him, than any
which could be drawn from the evidence, though that
evidence was, in itself, sufficient to satisfy any jury of the
guilt of the prisoner.
   </p><p>  In the report of Garnet's trial (State Trials), the
speech of Lord Northampton, one of the Royal Commissioners, occupies some sixteen pages of close-printed
folio ; and though the editor admits, in a note, that " My
Lord had corrected and somewhat enlarged its spoken
dimensions," it can hardly have occupied much less than
four hours in delivery. Yet it is very little to the purpose,
for the chief object of the speaker appears to have been
to exhibit his own pedantic learning, by illustrations from
the " works of all authors who ever were extant."
  </p><p>  Besides quotations from Tertullian, Democritus,
Heliodorus, Menenius Agrippa, and Thomas Aquinas,




          <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>

he cited Mahomet, Rahab, Nero, David, Telemachus,
Joseph, Valentinian, Pericles, Zedekiah, Trajan, and
King John, as instances, in support of the absurd paradoxes of which his oration was composed.
  </p><p>  The Attorney-General indulged in the vituperation
of the prisoner, usual in state trials of that time, interspersed with sneers at the Roman Catholic religion and
abuse of the Pope, but otherwise conducted the prosecution with ability, and placed the guilt of the prisoner
on grounds which he did not attempt to controvert, the
sacredness of confession being almost his only plea for
extenuation of his share in the plot. As there could be
no doubt that he was guilty of misprision or concealment
of the treason, he was sentenced accordingly, and executed on the 3rd May in St. Paul's Churchyard.
  </p><p>  He made a pious and moderate speech on the
scaffold, which, together with his meek and patient deportment, so favourably affected the spectators, that when,
in pursuance of the horrible ceremony of execution for
high treason, the executioner was proceeding to cut him
down from the gibbet while yet alive, to perform the
frightful barbarities of embowelling and quartering, the
people uttered such furious outcries and threats, that the
man slunk back in terror of their violence, and allowed
him to hang till life was extinct. The King took credit
for this afterwards, by declaring, that the executioner had
delayed cutting Garnet down by his express order, but
the other version is the most probable.
  </p><p>  Oldcorn, the unfortunate companion of Garnet in
the Priests' Hole at Hendlip, was placed on the rack









<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>
several times in the Tower, to draw from him further
explanations of the conversations between him and Garnet
in their adjoining prisons, which had been overheard and
reported; but he either knew little of the detail of the
plot and those engaged in it, or his courage defeated the
cruelty of his tormentors, for he confessed nothing; and
after a mock trial was sent to Worcester, and there executed, with the usual barbarities of the punishment for
high treason.
 </p><p>   On reviewing the circumstances of the Gunpowder
Plot, we shall find that in one respect it differs from any
other of the wild and desperate attempts of this kind
recorded in history. The men who are commonly found
to engage in such enterprises are persons who have lost
all, or have never had anything to lose, and who venture
their worthless lives, for the chance of gaining plunder
or power.
  </p><p>   But Catesby and his comrades, though they had
many of them been licentious in early life, and had taken
part in Essex's insurrection and other treasonable schemes,
arising out of the great religious and political changes in
the government of England, were men of a higher class
than those who usually plunge into schemes of violence
and murder.  Most of them were men who in peaceable times, and free from the strong influence of religious
enthusiasm, might have passed through life as respectable
country gentlemen, living quietly with their families and
friends, and performing with credit the duties and avocations belonging to their position. The Attorney-General,
in his speech for the prosecution, did not fail to notice




           <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>


<figure id="Fig.039" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00039"><head>LITTLE EASE," GUY FAWKES'S DUNGEON, in Vaults of White Tower.</head></figure>

this fact, though in aggravation of their offence; for he
described them as "gentlemen of good houses, of excellent parts, and of very competent fortunes and estates."
  </p><p>  Although several of them expressed, after their trials,
a certain degree of contrition for having entered into the
wicked scheme of wholesale murder of the Royal Family
and Parliament, yet it cannot be doubted that their
consciences were lulled into a false repose, by the strong
conviction, that the terrible responsibility they had taken
on themselves, was a duty they were discharging to their
country and to their Maker. Grant, among others, declared on the scaffold, " I am convinced that our project
was so far from being sinful, that I rely on the part I
have taken in it, for an expiation of all the sins I have
ever committed." Finally, it must be observed that,








<pb id="p.134" n="134"/>
oppressed and insulted as the Roman Catholics had been
by laws and penalties disgraceful to any civilized nation,
yet the large majority of them showed abhorrence of
the massacre proposed by the conspirators, and expressed but little sympathy for the fate of the leaders of
the Gunpowder Plot. On the other hand, so violent was
the feeling in the House of Commons, that it was actually
question of petitioning the King that some " yet sharper
pains might be devised than customary in executions for
high treason," to mark the public horror of the contrivers
of so bloody and atrocious a crime.</p>

       <p> THE dismal records of the Tower present
          hardly any more melancholy story than
            that of Arabella Stuart, usually called " the
            Lady Arabella."  She was the only child
of Charles Earl of Lennox, younger brother of the
unfortunate Henry Darnley, and great-grandson  of
Margaret Queen of Scots, Henry VII.'s daughter. This
connection with the Blood Royal of England caused her
to be jealously watched both by Elizabeth and James.
Her personal charms, and her cultivated mind (she had
been carefully educated by her grandmother, the Countess
of Lennox, who resided in London), endeared her to
all, and made her one of the brightest ornaments of the
English Court.
   </p><p> Prompted by hatred of Elizabeth, the notorious
Father Parsons collected all the details of Arabella's connexion with the Crown, which he published in a pamphlet
dedicated to the Earl of Essex, in 1594, under the name
of Dolman; and though he could not maintain any immediate claim of Arabella's, yet by thus bringing forward
her name and descent, in a work which had considerable
circulation even among foreign courts, she became an







<pb id="p.136" n="136"/>

object of very general interest, which unhappily served
to increase the jealousy with which Elizabeth regarded
her. James had made an attempt to obtain Elizabeth's
consent to a marriage between Arabella and his cousin
Esme Stuart, Duke of Lennox; but the Queen refused,
on the ground that the Duke was a Papist. A son of the
Earl of Northumberland then became her suitor; but
the Queen, as soon as she observed that Lady Arabella
viewed him favourably, placed her in confinement, from
which she was not released till she had disclaimed any
further communication with her admirer.
    </p><p>On James's accession to the English throne her
position was by no means improved. The wild schemes
of Lord Cobham and his reckless conspiracy, embraced,
among other absurd projects, that of raising Arabella to
the English throne. On Cobham's trial, at which she
was present, Lord Burleigh vindicated her from  any
knowledge of this treason, by saying in open court,
" Here hath been a touch of Lady Arabella, a near
kinswoman of the King's. Let us not scandal the innocent. She is as innocent of all this as I or any man
here; for when she received a letter from Lord Cobham,
she only laughed at it, and immediately sent it to the
King ;" to which the old Earl of Nottingham, who was
standing next her, added, " The lady here doth protest,
upon her salvation, that she never dealt in any of these
things, and so she wills me to tell the Court."
 </p><p>   James appears to have been satisfied for the moment
with this solemn denial; but, with his usual meanness,
he so scantily supplied her with the means of maintaining



             <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>

 her exalted rank, that she was reduced to the most
distressing straits and difficulties.  Her employments,
according to a letter of the Queen's Master of Requests,
would seem to acquit her of all ambitious designs, or of
meddling in state affairs.  " She spends her time," writes
Fowler, "in lecture-reading, hearing of preaching and
service, and visiting the Princesses."
 </p><p>   About the year 1608, James seems to have received
her into better favour, for he gave her 1000 marks to pay
her debts, and 200L. worth of plate for her table, with
permission to marry, provided she chose a British subject.
Her choice fell upon W. Seymour, grandson to the Earl
of Hertford; but whether from doubts of the King's sincerity, or other reasons, Arabella required that their
marriage, which took place in 1609, should be kept
secret.  It was the discovery of the secrecy of her
marriage which gave the King a pretext for the persecution, with which he now began to harass his unfortunate
cousin. Upon a rumour of her having renewed her
intimacy with Seymour, they were both summoned before
the Privy Council; but, after a short examination, their
denial appears to have been admitted, and they were
released from  custody.  Next year, however, further
proofs being obtained by the King, the lady was placed
in charge of Sir T. Parry, at Lambeth, and her husband
committed to the Tower. One Melvin, confined there
as a Nonconforming minister, addressed this distich to
him:-
      <quote rend="blockquote"> "Communis tecum mihi causa est carceris, A ra-
           bella tibi causa est, Araque Sacra mihi.'
</quote>






<pb id="p.138" n="138"/>

There is a letter of Arabella's to the King in the Earl of
Oxford's collection, which was probably written at this
time:-</p>

    <p>Extract of Letter from LADY ARABELLA to LORD
                   (NORTHAMPTON ?).
   <quote rend="blockquote">"MY LORD,-The long acquaintance between us,
and the good experience of your honourable dealing
heretofore, maketh me not only hope, but be most assured,
that if you knew my most discomfortable and distressed
estate, you would acquaint his Majesty withal, and consequently procure my relief and redress, as you have done
at other times. I have been sick even to the death, from
which it hath pleased God miraculously to deliver me
for this present danger, but find myself so weak by reason
I have wanted those ordinary helps whereby most others
in my case, be they never so poor or unfortunate soever,
are preserved alive at least for charity, that, unless I may
be suffered to have those about me, that I may trust,
this sentence my Lord Treasurer pronounced after his
Majesty refusing that trifle of my work [she had worked
a piece of embroidery for the King, who refused to accept
it], by your persuasion, as I take it, will prove the certain
and apparent cause of my death, whereof I thought good
to advertise you, that you both may be the better prepared
in case you, or either of you, have possessed the King
with such opinions of me as thereupon I shall be suspected and restrained, till help come too late; and be
assured that neither physician, nor other, but when I think
good, shall come about me whilst I live, till I have his



       <pb id="p.139" n="139"/>

Majesty's favour, without which I desire not to live; and
if you remember of old, I dare die, so I be not guilty of
my own death, and oppress others with my ruin too, if
there be no other way, as God forbid. .... I can get
neither clothes nor posset at all, for example, nor anything but ordinary diet, nor compliments fit for a sick
body in my case when I call for it."</quote>
</p>
   <p> It was perhaps in consequence of the unhappy lady's
reasonable and humble appeal that she was removed
to a less rigorous confinement, at a Mr. Conyers's
house, near Highgate; and Mr. Seymour obtained " the
liberty of the Tower."  But the King, being informed
by his spies, that they were taking advantage of this
relaxation, to renew their correspondence, ordered Lady
Arabella to be removed to Durham Castle; and then,
driven to despair, they formed that plan of escape which,
failing by a most unhappy mistake, they never met
again.
  </p><p>  For some days Arabella appeared to renounce all
hope, and submit herself to the King's will, and thus
" induced her keepers and attendants into securitie by
the fayre shew of conformitye and willingness to goe on
her journey towards Durham," which journey was appointed for the next day. She then put on her disguise,
which consisted of a large pair of French-fashioned hose,
a man's doublet, a large peruke with long locks, a black
hat, black cloak, white, or, as another account says,
russet boots with red tops, and a rapier by her side.
Thus equipped, on Monday, the 4th of June, between







<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>

three and four in the afternoon, she boldly went forth,
accompanied by Mr. Markham, one of her attendants.
They went on foot for a mile and a half, till they reached
a small tavern, where Crompton, a devoted attendant,
waited for them with saddle-horses. But in the shattered
condition of Arabella's health, even the short walk had
been too much for her. She turned sick and faint, and
could scarcely mount her horse. " That gentleman will
hardly reach London," said the ostler, as he held the
stirrup for her to mount. As the distance, however, was
short, and her attendants were careful not to hurry her,
she reached Blackwall by six o'clock. There, at the
tavern, they learned that a flaxen-haired man, accompanied by a gentleman, had set off a little before. Arabella
waited at Blackwall an hour and a half, her servants
arriving one after another.  But she waited in vain
for Seymour, till delay became so hazardous that she
was forced to depart, taking with her only one female
attendant.  She set off in a boat with "a good pair
of oars," followed by another carrying their baggage.
The rest waited for Seymour. Arabella and her maid
were in the first boat, Crompton and Markham in the
second. They rowed down the Thames till. nearly opposite Leigh, where they saw a vessel lying at anchor.
Upon their hailing her, and asking whither she was bound,
Briggs, the master, answered, "For Berwick." Then the
youngest of the two servants said to the master, that if
he would leave his voyage, and serve him, he would give
him any money he chose to ask. The master refused
the offer, saying that he was bound to his merchant, and



     <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>

could not break his word. They then asked him if there
was not a French vessel lying somewhere near. The
master answered that he knew not, unless it might be a
vessel that was riding about a mile and a half up the river.
They said that, if it were the right ship, they should recognise her by a flag which the master had promised to hold
out; so rowing up to her, they found she was the desired
bark, and all four went on board, in the sight of the Berwick captain. The latter particularly noticed the company,
which he described as consisting of " a man about forty
years, with a long flaxen beard, something corpulent,
and, as he remembered, in a suit of grey cloth, with a
rapier and a dagger gilt. The other was younger, with a
little black beard, who was the man that most desired the
master to receive them, and carry them for Calais, with
large proffers for the passage, who, as he remembered,
was in black apparel. The third man he did not notice,
and therefore could not describe him. Of the women
one was barefaced, in a black riding safe-guard, with a
black hat, having nothing on her head but a black hat
and her hair. This last he took to be Moll Cutpurse;
and thought that, if it were she, she had made some fault,
and was desirous of escape. The other woman sat close
covered, with a black hood or veil over her head and
face, so that he could not see her: only saw that under
her mantle she had a white attire (a glimpse of her white
boots), and that, on pulling off her glove, 'a marvellous
fair white hand was revealed.'"
 </p><p>   Arabella had now escaped the greater dangers, and
reached the French ship. But where was Seymour? At






<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>
every station she had lingered with fatal delay, in the
hopes of his joining her; and now, having exhausted the
last moment of time, she besought the ship to remain at
anchor till he arrived.  Her followers, more prudent,
knew that imminent danger had already been incurred by
the time they had lost, and that they risked the whole
enterprise by these dangerous delays. Nothing but the
dread of her husband's capture, if he did not reach the
French ship, can account for her imprudence.  Her
followers at last refused to listen any longer to her
entreaties, and, desiring the master to make sail, proceeded to sea, with their charge, a prey to dreadful
anxiety as to whether her husband had eluded pursuit.
  </p><p>  In the mean time Seymour's escape from the Tower
had been managed with entire success. He had obtained a
disguise, consisting of a peruque and beard of black hair,
and a tawny suit. A cart had come into the gate early
in the morning, bringing his billets of wood, and Seymour
"walked alone without suspicion from his lodging, following this cart, as it returned," by the Tower wharf, and
passing the warder at the iron gate, where he found one
Rodney waiting for him with a boat. With two servants
and Rodney, he rowed hard till they came to Leigh,
hoping to find the French ship; but as no sign of her
was to be seen, and the sea was becoming too rough for
their boat, they hired a fishing-boat, for twenty shillings.
to carry them to a collier, which was visible in the distance, slowly sailing down the river. The master, seeing
"a gentleman in a full suit of satin, laid with gold and
silver lace, asked his name; who answered, 'Rodney;' "



       <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>

and after some talk, the master agreed to put off his voyage
to Newcastle, and, for the sum of forty pounds, to carry
the boat's crew to Calais. The collier, having received
them on board, proceeded down the Thames till they drew
near to a place called "the Buoy." Suddenly, Rodney
saw a French vessel in the distance, and hurriedly called
on the master of the collier to speak with her. The
master declared that in the position they were it was impossible to approach her, but promised, if they " anchored
near, to send his boat on board the same."
  </p><p>  At noon they cast anchor at "the Buoy," and a
quarter of an hour after the French bark cast anchor
about a mile and a half off. The boat of the collier was
then lowered, and boarded the Frenchman, but, finding
the vessel was not that of which they were in quest, they
again weighed their anchor. The wind preventing them
from standing for Calais, they put in near Harwich on
Tuesday night; and on Thursday, the wind being still
contrary, they made for Ostend. Some of the crew of
the collier beginning to ask questions, Rodney said they
were leaving England on account of a duel. On Friday
morning, at eight o'clock, they reached Ostend; and
the master, having received the money for his voyage,
returned to Ipswich, carrying with him a letter from
Rodney to Francis Seymour.
  </p><p>  The moment it was known at Court that Arabella and
Seymour had escaped from Conyers' house and from the
Tower, one of the King's messengers came galloping
from Lord Salisbury to Phineas Pette, at Deptford, the






<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>

King's master-shipwright, "to man the Light Horseman
with twenty musqueteers, and to run out as low as the
Nore head, to search all shippes, barks, and other vessels,
for the Lady Arabella." The order was promptly obeyed,
but the vessels were searched in vain, as well as every
house in the town of Leigh.
  </p><p>  On the same day, the following proclamation was
made, forbidding any to assist the fugitives, and commanding all, under high penalties, to surrender them:-

  </p><p>  "Whereas we are geven to understand that the Lady
Arabella and William Seymour, second Sonne to the
Lord Beauchampe, being for divers great and haynous
Offences committed, the one to our Tower of London,
and the other to speciall Guard, have found the means,
by the wicked Practises of divers lewd Persons, as,
namely, Markham, Crompton, Rodney, and others, to
breake Prison and make Escape, on Monday, the third
of June, with an intent to transport themselves into
forreyne Partes. Wee doe hereby straightly charge and
command all Persones whatsoever, upon their Allegiance
and Dutie, not onlie to forbeare to receave, harbor, or
assist them in their passage anie way, as they will answer
it at their Perilles; but upon the like charge and Paine
to use the best meanes they can for their Apprehension,
and Keeping them in safe Custody, which Wee will take
as an acceptable Service.
  </p><p>  "Given at Greenwich, the fowerth Daie of June,
1611
                              "PER IPSUM REGEM."



           <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>

  </p><p>  Salisbury was then ordered to send a letter, post haste,
to the Governor of Calais, to stop the fugitives should
they arrive in that port. The French ambassador was also
requested to send a message to the Governor of Calais
to detain them, till the pleasure of the King of France
should be known. James added that he did not think
they meant to stay in France, or that they "expected
anie good that way," but only to land, and from thence
have an easy passage to some place on the Continent.
  </p><p>  The next step was to send vessels to sea in pursuit.
Admiral Monson discovered, by means of the waterman
who had rowed her down the river, that Arabella had
gone on board the French ship at about four o'clock in
the morning; and that she had been detained two hours
by the ebb, which, however, he reckoned would be
recovered, for he calculated that she could not fetch
beyond the North Foreland; and if the wind were east,
it would be impossible to reach Calais that night. He
immediately ordered a ship of war to stand over for
Calais; and, while the larger vessel was preparing, he
seized an oyster-boat, and put six men, with shot, in her,
to hasten after the fugitives with all speed. The Admiral
himself went out in a light fishing-craft, and sent a vessel,
named the Adventure, towards Calais, while another was
despatched to the coast of Flanders.
 </p><p>   About half-Channel over, the Adventure got sight
of a small vessel under all sail for Calais, and crowded
sail to pursue her; but so little wind blew that neither
pursuer nor pursued could make much way. The Adventure then lowered a boat, with an armed crew, which







<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>

soon arrived at the French vessel, and, having vainly
challenged her, endeavoured to stop her course by firing
musketry, while the Adventure was fast gaining on the
chase. The French vessel stood thirteen shots before
she surrendered, when Arabella-for it was too truly her
vessel-seeing that all hope was over, came forward and
discovered herself to the officer of the boat, who instantly
demanded her husband. She answered bravely, that she
had not seen him, but hoped he had got safely over, declaring that her joy at his escape was greater than her grief
at her own capture. She was then taken on board the
Adventure, and there kept close prisoner till they reached
the river, when Monson sent the intelligence to Lord
Salisbury, not permitting Arabella to leave the ship till
he received orders, though he declared that "in the
mean time she should not want anything the shore
could afford, or any other honourable privilege." James
immediately ordered her to be sent to the Tower.
Sir John More, writing to Sir Ralph Winwood, says,
" In this passionate hurry here was a proclamation first
conceived in very bitter terms; but my Lord Treasurer's
moderation seasoned at the print, as now here you find
it. There are likewise three letters despatched in haste,
written by Sir Thomas Lake to the King and Queen
Regent of France, and to the Archdukes, all written with
harsher ink than now if they were to do (I presume) they
should be, especially that to the Archdukes, which did seem
to presuppose their course to tend that way; and all
three describing the offence in black colours, and pressing their sending back without delay. Indeed the genera




     <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>

belief was that they intended to settle themselves in
Brabant, and under the favour of the Popish faction; but
now I rather think they will be most pitied by the
Puritans, and that their course did wholly tend to France.
And though for the former I had only mine own corrigible
imagination, yet for the latter many potent reasons do
concur: As that the ship that did attend them was
French, the place that Mr. Seymour made for was Calais,
the man that made their perukes was a French clockmaker, who is fled with them, and in the ship is said to
be found a French post with letters from the Ambassador.
  </p><p>  "The proclamation for the oath is by divers found
strange, for that it is so general; but where love is,
loyalty will not be found wanting."

     </list>

   </p><p> An examination was shortly held before the Lords of
the Council, in which every attempt was made to entrap
the prisoners into some confession which should legally
justify their imprisonment, and prove them guilty of high
treason. Arabella answered calmly; but the Countess of
Shrewsbury was so excited and indignant at the unjust and
secret tribunal before which she was summoned, that she
declared that she would answer nothing in private; if she
had offended against the law, she would answer it in
public. The chief evidence against her consisted in the
large amount of ready money that was found at her disposal-no less than 20,000l., besides bills of exchange
for the use of Arabella. All this was supposed to be destined to bribe the Catholic party; and though it was
acknowledged that Arabella had "not yet been found
inclinable to Popery," yet, says the sagacious More, "her
aunt made account belike that, being beyond the seas in
the hands of Jesuits and priests, either the stroke of their
arguments or the pinch of poverty might force her to the
other side. Our Scots and English differ much," he continues, "in opinion upon this point. These do hold that,
if this couple should have escaped, the danger was not




     <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>

like to have been very great, in regard that their pretensions are so many degrees removed, and they ungraceful
both in their persons and in their houses ; so as a hot alarm
taken at the matter will make them more illustrious in the
world's eye than now they are; and so it is said to fill
his Majesty with fearful imaginations, and with him the
Prince, who cannot easily be removed from any settled
opinion."
  </p><p>  In addition to the above arrests, the Earl of Shrewsbury was kept a prisoner in his own house; and the old
Earl of Hertford summoned to Court, with the proviso,
"if he be found healthful enough to travel, he must not
delay his coming."
 </p><p>   An appearance of indifference was the only way
by which W. Seymour could hope to disarm the King's
anger against him; and not only did he abstain from any
further endeavour to rescue Arabella, but it appears too
sure that he never attempted to soothe her distress by
getting any letters conveyed to her. Had he done so,
her reason might possibly have been preserved under all
her sorrows; and there can be little doubt that subordinate persons, in attendance on the Tower prisoners,
might have been bribed for this purpose. But it would
seem that, whatever the loyalty and spirit afterwards
shown by Seymour, in his gallant adherence to the fortunes of James's son and successor, he was a stranger to
that devotion which the conduct of his wife must have
inspired in a more tender nature. It is, however, to be
remembered, whether from revival of old feelings, or some
regrets at his former conduct, Seymour, when an old







<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>

man, and after many years of marriage to a second wife,
expressly desired, in his will, to be buried by the side of
Arabella Stuart.
  </p><p>  Lady Shrewsbury, though detained a prisoner, was
granted many indulgences. She was allowed the liberty
of the Tower, and even permitted a short respite to wait
on her husband, who was attacked with illness. It was
believed that she might have regained her liberty altogether, had it not been for some incoherent accusations
made against her by the Lady Arabella, whose sorrows had
at length affected her reason. Upon the pretext of these
accusations James again ordered her into close constraint
till she should answer certain interrogatories; but she still
proudly refused to answer anything in private, although
she declared her willingness to submit to a public examination. On the 2nd of July, 1612, she was called before
the Privy Council and Judges, at the Lord Chancellor's,
where she was "charged by the Attorney-General with
contempt towards the King by refusing at the first
summons to answer all questions."    Her persistent
refusal, it was said, greatly aggravated her fault, as well
as the scornful terms she used towards some of the lords.
She again urged "the privilege of her person and
nobility," and, after a fruitless discussion, was sent back
to the Tower, with a menace of a proceeding in the Star
Chamber if she persisted in her wilfulness.
   </p><p> The death of Lord Beauchamp, in July, 1612,
brought William Seymour a step nearer to the succession, and rendered it the more important in the King's
eyes that Arabella and he should never be reunited;



             <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>

but there was little fear of that now.  At times her
intellect showed signs of its former brightness, and a
feigned cheerfulness took the place of her despair. " To
express her joy" at the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth, she decked herself in courtly robes, and " provided
herself with four gowns of the richest description;" but
this pretended satisfaction produced no result, as the
Princess, in all the joy of bridal pomp and happiness,
"had not a thought" for her miserable cousin in the
Tower.
  </p><p>  Early in March, 1613, Arabella was attacked with
convulsions, and declared distracted by the physician-
a declaration which probably saved the Countess of
Shrewsbury, by invalidating the accusations which her
niece had in her frenzy made against her.
 </p><p>   On the 13th of May, 1613, Sir William Waad, the

place, "to the great contentment of the prisoners," on
an accusation of embezzling the lost jewels of Arabella.
Whether he or his wife or daughter took them, was not
clearly proved, but they had certainly disappeared; and
he had acquired such a bad name by his extortions and
hard usage of his prisoners that no one regretted his
disgrace.

of London."

of Mary Queen of Scots.     The burial-service was read
as if by stealth over some felon's grave, "because to have
a great funeral for one dying out of the King's favour,
would have reflected upon the King's honour."

lain in her unnoticed grave in Henry VII.'s Chapel.

         <p>THE   murder of Sir T. Overbury in the
           Tower, in 1613, was one of the darkest
           deeds which stain the annals of James I.'s
           reign. This man had been raised from a
low station by Carr, Lord Rochester, and had become his
intimate counsellor and friend. Acting with an honesty
towards his patron which deserved a better reward, he
had earnestly dissuaded him from his disgraceful connexion with Lady Essex, which, becoming known to that
vindictive woman, she induced her paramour to obtain
an arbitrary order from the King for the committal of
Overbury to the Tower, where he was closely incarcerated, and precluded from any intercourse and correspondence with his friends and family.
 </p><p>   Sir W. Waad, the Lieutenant, whom Raleigh, in one
of his letters, called "that villain Waad," and who was
anything but lenient to his prisoners, was yet a man incapable of lending himself to the iniquitous projects of
Lady Essex, and was therefore removed, to be replaced
by a creature of Somerset's, ready to undertake any crime
to forward his own interest. Sir Gervase Elways, the
new Lieutenant, at once entered into the cruel design of







<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>
destroying Overbury by slow poisons, which for a length
of time were mixed with his daily meals. The wretched
man's constitution resisted their effects too long for the
patience of the Countess, who lived in dread of his finding
means to publish the knowledge he possessed of her profligacy.  It was therefore determined to put a quicker
end to his life, by a strong dose of corrosive sublimate,
under the effects of which he died in dreadful agonies.
The appearance of his body after death, being such as
would have excited suspicion, if seen, it was wrapped in a
sheet, and buried privately the same day in the Tower
chapel.
   </p><p>  Soon after this the favour of the new Earl of Somerset
began to decline. Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, was
fast supplanting him in the King's good graces; and the
rumours afloat as to Overbury's death led to an inquiry
which soon left no doubt of his having come to his end
by poison.
   </p><p>  One Weston, who had been employed as Overbury's
gaoler in the Tower, being apprehended, made some
confessions which caused the seizure and committal of
Sir Gervase Elways, Sir Thomas Monson, and Mrs.
Turner, a person deep in Lady Essex's wicked secrets
and confidence. Their imprisonment was a prelude to
the committal to the Tower of the Earl and Countess of
Somerset themselves.
  </p><p>   Weston being brought to trial, it was proved that he
had been placed in the Tower as Sir T. Overbury's
keeper by Sir Thomas Monson, at the instance of the
Countess, and that the various slow poisons administered



        <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

by his means to the prisoner, had been supplied by Mrs.
Turner, who was tried, found guilty, and hanged, as was
likewise Weston.  Monson was shortly after released,
partly from want of proof, and partly from some mysterious influence attributed by common report to the King
himself.
   </p><p> Elways made so bold and able a defence that it was
thought at first he would be acquitted; but one Franklin,
being produced as evidence, swore that, being with Mrs.
Turner at Lady Essex's house, to receive orders for the
purchase and preparation of poisons, a letter chanced
to be brought to her from Elways, which from its bad
writing she could not well read, and desired Franklin,
who knew his handwriting better, to read it to her. This
he did; and, in doing so, observed particularly the expression, in reference to Overbury, that " This scab is like
the fox, the more he is cursed the more he thrives."
Upon this, and other corroborating evidence, Elways
was sentenced to death, but permitted, at his special
entreaty, to be hanged on Tower Hill instead of at Tyburn.
He exercised a curious taste in dress on this occasion. "He was habited in a black suit and black jerkin
with hanging sleeves; on his head he wore a crimson
satin cap laced round about, and under that a white linen
night-cap with a border, and over that a black hat with
a broad ribbon and ruff-band, thick couched with lace, a
pair of sky-coloured silk stockings, and a pair of three-soled
shoes (quaere, high-heeled ?)." On the scaffold, at Tower
Hill, he acknowledged his sentence to be just; but declared, that, though he knew of the murder, he had no







<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>

actual part in it, and that he had received all his instructions from Sir T. Monson, on behalf of the Countess of
Somerset.
   </p><p> He was accompanied to the gallows by two of the
King's chaplains, Drs. Whyting and Felton. A large number of persons of condition also attended at his execution,
to whom he thus returned his thanks for the compliment:
" Nobles and others," he said, "to see your faces here
rejoiceth me, whereby you show your love in granting
my request to witness my death." After some other
remarks to the same effect, he went on to say, "that
though his end was a bitter cup, it was mingled with
God's mercy in calling him away thus, whereas He might
have taken his life in shooting London Bridge, or by some
fall or accident, and then some unrepented sin had been
damnation to him." He said also that he accounted it
a favour of the King that he should die on Tower Hill,
and not at Tyburn, which was a place of more public
reproach, "whereby," said he, "I now see the Tower,
wherein of late I had been called to business of the State."
  </p><p>   This wretched man seems to have set great value on
his office in the Tower, as it came out on his trial, that,
so far from his appointment being a gratuitous benefit
conferred on him by Somerset, he had paid Waad no less
than 1400L. to vacate it in his favour, and had further
engaged to pay him 600L. more. No doubt the emoluments and fees extorted in those days from the state
prisoners, produced a large income; but the sum was
a very large one, especially when the nomination was
conditional on his abetting a murder.



         <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>

   </p><p> It is recorded of Sir G. Elways's own servant, as
a proof of his extreme devotion to his master, that he
assisted the executioner's man in pulling his legs after he
was turned off the ladder; a kindness no doubt in shortening his sufferings, but one which few could have brought
themselves to perform.
 </p><p>   The trial of the Earl and Countess of Somerset was
put off, on different pretexts, till May 1616, when the
Countess confessed herself guilty; and as it was evident
to the lords who tried the case, that Somerset knew of his
abandoned wife's proceedings, they were both sent back to
the Tower, where the Earl remained a prisoner till 1621;
but, strange to say, the Countess very soon after received
the royal pardon. They were both ordered to repair
either to Grays or Cowsham, houses of Lord Wallingford, in Oxfordshire, and to remain, on pain of death,
within three miles' compass of the same. Here they
retired, shunned and abhorred by all, till the year 1624,
when, a few months before his own death, the King
granted them both a full pardon, leaving them, however,
so destitute from the confiscation of their property, that
they were compelled to remain in entire obscurity. The
Countess died in 1632, but Somerset survived her several
years in want and misery.
  </p><p>  The Earl of Essex, after his wife's desertion of him,
served many years in the Low   Countries, where he
acquired that knowledge of war so often fatal to the
Royalists when he became General of the Parliament's
army in the Civil War.</p>

         <p>FEW  characters in English history have inspired more interest that the gallant and
            unfortunate Sir Walter Raleigh.
                A full narrative of his brilliant career
during the reign of Elizabeth would be a history of some
of the most glorious passages of her reign. A soldier, a
seaman, and a statesman, it was by his advice she was
mostly guided in the measures so successfully carried out
for encountering the great Armada, and defeating that
prodigious armament.
    </p><p> But before this event, his gallant conduct in the
Netherlands, his voyages of discovery and conquests,
especially the planting of the British flag by one of his
captains, Sir Richard Greenville, on the shores of what
is now named Carolina, but was then named Virginia by
the Queen herself, and his eminent services in Ireland, had
raised the fame of Raleigh to a very high standard, not
in England only, but throughout all parts of Europe.
The Queen loaded him with honours and riches, but,
with all her consideration for him as a statesman and
a soldier, the delight she took in descending to the most
absurd coquetry, led her to encourage the competition



       <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>

of Raleigh and Essex for her favour, and by a show of
alternate preference to keep up the farce of a romantic
rivalry between them.
   </p><p> After the defeat of the Armada, to which the spirit
and skill of Raleigh had so greatly contributed, he had
reached the highest pinnacle of court favour, when the
discovery by the Queen of his intrigue with Elizabeth
Throgmorton, one of her maids of honour, threw her
into transports of fury, and she at once consigned them
both to a close imprisonment in the Tower. The cell
which tradition has assigned to Raleigh on this occasion
proves the severity of his captivity, while the Queen's
anger lasted.
  </p><p>  After a short time, however, Raleigh, by a letter to
the Queen of the most fulsome flattery, obtained his
release and married Elizabeth Throgmorton, who proved
a most devoted and faithful wife, through all the trying
vicissitudes of fortune which aftervards befel him. But
the Queen still owed him a grudge for having admired
any woman but herself, and his first expedition to Guiana
seems to have been undertaken while he was yet in
disgrace, and in order to keep out of her Majesty's sight
till her displeasure should have passed. After his return
he was again recalled to Court, where, as Captain of the
Body Guard, he was generally near her Majesty's person,
and his ability to discourse with eloquence on all matters,
from the highest affairs of state, to his own marvellous
adventures and perils by sea and land, attracted the
Queen's attention and favour, while his display of dress
and magnificence flattered her vanity.






<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>

    His conspicuous wisdom in the very curious parliamentary debates which occurred about this time, on monopolies, on the designs and policy of Spain, and other
important national topics, gave him great weight in the
country; but his opposition to Lord Burleigh on certain
commercial questions, contributed to revive their old
dissensions, which proved afterwards a source of serious
injury to Raleigh.
  </p><p>  The mighty sovereign, who, with all her prejudice
and caprices, well knew how to distinguish the best servants
of the country and the Crown, and who had made amends
to Raleigh, by her late gifts and distinctions, for her former
severity, was now drawing near her end, to be succeeded
by one who, with far more of personal weakness and vanity,
possessed none of her great qualities. King James's
antipathy to war rendered him incapable of appreciating
the military capacity of Raleigh, which only inspired him
with jealousy and distrust. In respect to learning too,
James's was a pedantry of the most paltry sort, and was
very inferior to the philosophy and extensive range of
Raleigh's mind. The late Earl of Essex, who had paid
great court to James for years before his accession, had
strongly prejudiced him against Raleigh, as a man of
dangerous designs, and likely to oppose his accession.
 </p><p>   Lord Cobham, brother-in-law of Burleigh, who appears to have been a restless intriguer, with neither heart
nor character, had entered into correspondence with
Count Aremberg, a Flemish minister of the King of
Spain, and had persuaded him, that peace with Spain
might be brought about, if Sir W. Raleigh's opposition to




     <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>

it could be overcome, suggesting that this might be
managed by a bribe. It was this offer (though rejected
by Raleigh as an idle tale of Cobham's own invention),
combined with a rumour of his having conspired to place
Lady Arabella Stuart on the throne, which formed the
basis of the accusations of treason brought against him
by James, for the trial of which a commission was assembled at Winchester, Burleigh himself being one of the
members. It is scarcely credible to what violent language,
and vulgar insult, the Attorney-General, Sir E. Coke,
descended, in bringing forward the charges, all of which
were met and refuted by the prisoner, with a patience
and dignity worthy of his noble nature. The Commissioners, to their disgrace, seldom interposed. Burleigh,
on the contrary, made some specious remarks, which
tended to prejudice them against the prisoner, and Chief-
Justice Popham alone of the Commissioners seemed to
recollect his position as a judicial personage, intrusted
with the life and honour of an illustrious prisoner.
   </p><p> The evidence on which the Commission found
Raleigh guilty of high treason, after a quarter of an
hour's pretended deliberation, was such as could never
in our times have procured a conviction; and it was
even said that when Coke, who had gone out of the
Court for air, and was walking in the Castle garden,
was told the verdict, he said to his informant, "Surely
you are mistaken ? I myself accused him only of misprision (concealment) of treason ! " Whether from compunction, or that he was content to have Raleigh now
wholly in his power, the King did not carry out the







<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>
sentence, but after a month of cruel suspense at Winchester, ordered him to be removed to close confinement
in the Tower. The Lords Cobham and Grey, and Sir
G. Markham, were tried and found guilty by the same
Commission, and the King, when he signed the warrant
for their execution, directed that Raleigh should be informed that a warrant for his death had also been prepared. In order, however, more completely to blast his
character, and to give more authority to the verdict, the
King had recourse to a paltry stratagem, by which,
though he himself regarded it as a masterpiece of policy,
no one was deceived. Cobham was brought out on the
scaffold at Winchester, and made, what purported to be,
a dying speech, asserting the truth of the evidence he
had given against Raleigh, at the conclusion of which
the Sheriff informed him (as had been preconcerted) that
the King pardoned him, and, with loud expressions of
feigned astonishment and gratitude, he was reconducted
to his prison.
  </p><p>  Raleigh, in the mean time, made becoming preparation
for the end he daily expected. He received the Bishop
of Winchester's prayers and consolations, in a spirit
which greatly edified that prelate, and wrote a touching
letter of farewell to his wife, some passages of which
may here be transcribed:-

   </p><p>  "You shall now receive, my dear wife, my last
words. My love I send you, that you may keep it when
I am dead, and my counsel, that you may remember it
when I am no more. I would not by my will present





       <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

you with sorrows, my dear Bess; let them go into the
grave with me, and be buried in the dust; and seeing
it is not the will of God that ever I shall see you more
in this life, bear it patiently, and with a heart like
thyself.
   </p><p> " I send you all the thanks which my heart can conceive, or my words can express, for your many travails
and care taken for me; which though they have not
taken effect as you wished, yet my debt to you is not
the less.
 </p><p>   " I beseech you, for the love you bear me living, do
not hide yourself after my death, but seek to help your
miserable fortunes, and the right of your poor child.
Thy mourning cannot avail me when I am but dust."

  </p><p>  He then enters into some detail of the condition
of his estates, and what he can leave her, and thus
resumes:-

   </p><p> " If you can live free from want, care for no more
the rest is but vanity. Love God, and repose yourself on
Him, and therein you shall find true and lasting riches
and endless comfort. Teach your son to love and fear
God while he is yet young, that the fear of God may
grow up with him, and then God will be a husband to
you, and a father to him.
  </p><p>  " I can say no more, time and death call me away.'

 </p><p>   If any proof were needed that the insinuations of
Coke, and even of Chief-Justice Popham, on his late trial.
that he was an atheist, were utterly false, surely the pious




<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>
simplicity and religious trust of this letter at once refute
them.
  </p><p>  Shortly after the pretended reprieve of Cobham,
Raleigh was conveyed from Winchester to the Tower,
and, at her earnest entreaty, Lady Raleigh was allowed to
share his prison, where their youngest son, Carew, was
afterwards born.
 </p><p>   Mr. Hawthorn, a clergyman, a physician, and his
steward, were allowed occasionally to visit him in prison,
and it was under the heavy affliction of disgrace and
confinement that he turned his active mind to the composition of his celebrated 'History of the World,'
  </p><p>  But the King's persecution did not end yet. Raleigh's estate of Sherborne, which he had been allowed
to place in the hands of trustees for his eldest son, was,
contrary to all faith, seized, on pretence of a flaw in the
deed, and given to the worthless Robert Carr. Lady
Raleigh in vain threw herself at James's feet to entreat
that her son might not be reduced to beggary.  He
received her harshly, and merely repeated, " I maun have
the land, I maun have it for Carr."
   </p><p>  A more powerful intercessor, Prince Henry, who had
conceived a great friendship as well as admiration for
Raleigh, urged his suit with his utmost zeal, believing it
to be of national importance, that so brave and wise a
commander should not languish in captivity and disgrace;
but his exertions were fruitless. Prince Henry had no
wild ambition for distinction in war, but he fully agreed
with the views of naval preparation which Raleigh's wisdom
and forethought had urgently represented as necessary for



      <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

England. "Though the sword," said Raleigh, "is put in
the sheath, we must not suffer it to rust, or stick so fast
that we could not draw it readily when need requires.
If those powerful means, whereby we reduced our enemies to the seeking of peace, were neglected, so that
we could not assume the use of them, those proud mastering spirits would be more likely to shake us by the
ears as enemies, than to take us by the hand as friends.
Therefore, far be it from us to trust more to the friendship
of strangers, which is but dissembled upon policy, than
to our own strength. Peace is a blessing of God, and
therefore, doubtless, blessed are those means whereby
peace is gained and preserved. Our defence and safety
is in our shipping and sea forces, which should be esteemed
as His gifts, and then only available and beneficial, when
He vouchsafes us his grace to use them aright."
  </p><p>  The hardships of Raleigh's imprisonment in the
Tower, were in some degree alleviated by the company of some of his fellow-captives; amongst whom
were the Earl of Northumberland, a man of considerable learning, who had been committed on the same
charge as Raleigh; Piercy, a great chemist, confined
since the Gunpowder Plot for supposed participation in
that conspiracy; and Hoskins, a poet and philosopher
of his day, mentioned by Ben Jonson as " the man who
polished him."  Although Sir W. Waad, the Governor of
the Tower, was no friend to Raleigh, he does not appear
to have put any needless restraint on the meeting of these
literary companions in misfortune at Northumberland's
apartments, where discourses and experiments on chemistry







<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>
were a favourite resource.  Still a long confinement in so
damp and cold an abode as the Tower (surrounded as it



<figure id="Fig.045" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00045"><head>
 Sir Walter Raleigh's Cell in White Tower.</head></figure>

then was, by a wide muddy ditch), had now produced
injurious effects on Raleigh's health. In a pathetic appeal
to James's Queen, for her intercession, he complained,
that, after eight years, he was under as much restraint as
the first day, and that " he had in vain petitioned for so
much grace, as to walk with his keeper up the hill within
the Tower."   His physician also represented to Lord




       <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>

Burleigh, the necessity of his lodging in a warmer apartment, which had been built for a laboratory in the garden
of his prison. Whether this favour was obtained, does not
appear; but there is no doubt that the death of his old
and vindictive enemy, Lord Burleigh, about this time,
produced some change for the better in his treatment.
His release, however, was still opposed by the unworthy
Somerset, who had obtained from the King Raleigh's
valuable estate at Sherborne. One solace of Raleigh's
weary sojourn in the Tower was the correspondence and
kind notice of Prince Henry, who was wont to say to his
private friends, that " his father was the only man who
would have shut up such a bird in a cage." In his ' History of the World,' Raleigh alludes in a touching tone
to the early loss of this admirable Prince. " I had written
for the Prince, a Treatise on the 'Art of War by Sea,'
but God hath spared me the labour of finishing it by his
loss; I will therefore leave him in the hands of God, that
hath him. ' Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent.'"
  </p><p>  Soon after this misfortune the continued efforts of his
friends procured him what was termed the " Liberty of
the Tower," which consisted in the free range of the
interior of the fortress, and he now brought before the
King, the scheme for the expedition to Guiana, where he
was convinced that he had ascertained the existence of a
gold-mine at the time of his expedition to America during
the former reign.
 </p><p>   As the expense was all to come from the resources
of his friends and himself, and the King was to have a
fifth of the profits, he was not likely to resist this bait for








<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>

his avarice; the only obstacle arose from the remonstrances of Gondomar, the Spanish Ambassador, who, by
his address and accomplishments, had obtained much
influence over the King's mind.  He knew Raleigh's
enmity to the Spanish nation, and had no doubt that, if he
gained a footing in Guiana, the occupation of the shores
of the Orinoco by his countrymen, where a kinsman of
his own had been appointed Governor, would soon be
put a stop to, by the English expedition. For this reason
he made the strongest remonstrances against Raleigh's
scheme, and at first succeeded in persuading James that
it would lead to a war with Spain.
 </p><p>   But although arguments might fail, Raleigh was
aware that well-applied bribery would succeed, and by a
large present to Sir W. St. John and Sir E. Villiers, the
two uncles of Buckingham, he at length, in March, 1615,
obtained the King's consent to the project, and three days
afterwards the order arrived, for his release from the sad
confinement in which he had passed some of the best
years of his life, and he at once entered, with all the
ardour of his nature, into the preparation for his expedition. Wonderful as it may seem, he had contrived for
several years to maintain an intercourse with some of the
most civilised of the Indian chiefs, whom he had known
on his former expedition, and a deputation from these
Indians had actually come to England, and obtained
access to him while prisoner in the Tower. As Gondomar
continued incessant in his remonstrances to the King,
and as little dependence could be placed on any resolution of James, Raleigh deemed it advisable to make a




              <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>

formal protest, that he had no thoughts of attacking
Spanish territory, but simply desired to prosecute his
search for mines in those portions of Guiana, which, by
right of discovery, and consent of the natives, were regarded as belonging to the British Crown.
  </p><p>  Gondomar affected to be content with these explanations, and, upon his opposition being withdrawn, adventurers from all parts of England volunteered their services,
many of them bringing money and supplies, while several
eminent merchants embarked capital in the enterprise.
  </p><p>  A commission under the Privy Seal constituted
Raleigh Commander-in-Chief and Governor. Some wary
friends advised him to press for the formality of a pardon
under the Great Seal before he sailed, but this caution
was unhappily overlooked; and indeed who could for a
moment suppose that his appointment as " Commander
and Governor," with power of life and death over those
under his orders, would not completely cancel any former
sentence ? On hoisting his flag on board the 'Destiny,' a
ship of thirty-six guns and 200 men (including the Volunteers), and commanded by his eldest son, he issued an
order for Divine Service to be daily read in the squadron,
and for sundry measures of morality and discipline,
showing the religious tone of his mind, as well as his
knowledge of the best means of governing the wild spirits
he commanded. The weather obliging him to put into
Cork, he was generously received,. and supplied with
many useful stores by the Earl of Cork, who had purchased Raleigh's Irish estates many years before, and







<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>
improved them with the utmost success. He again put
to sea full of hopes and confidence; but though the
voyage was neither tedious nor stormy, the ravages of
scurvy and fever made sad havoc among his men.
He reached Guiana in November, with his numbers reduced by a fourth, and learned, to his mortification, that
the Spaniards had established themselves on the shore of
the river Orinoco, of which he had formerly taken possession in the name of the Queen.
 </p><p>   To ascend that river as far as the supposed situation
of the mine, was now his great object; but he found that
all his schemes had been betrayed to the Spaniards, and
that, so far from any chance of surprising them into
granting him a free passage up the river, they had made
preparation for giving him a hostile reception, and had
occupied in force the access from the river to the mine.
Prostrate with illness himself, he at once resolved to
detach his son and Captain Keymis, the original discoverer of the mine on the former expedition, with instructions to penetrate at all hazards to the place, avoiding
collision if possible; but, if attacked, to repel force by
force.
  </p><p>   The result was most unfortunate: the Spaniards laid
an ambush for the English; and though Keymis and young
Raleigh fought most gallantly, the latter was killed, and
Keymis, after an unsuccessful attempt to reach the mine,
was again surprised, utterly defeated, and obliged to
return, without having brought back a single ingot to
prove the existence of the mine. The unfortunate man,




         <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

on being reproached by Raleigh with neglect of his instructions and orders, retired to his cabin and blew out
his brains.  Harsh as it might appear in Raleigh to
condemn so gallant a follower for this unlucky failure, it
must be recollected that he had thrown away many
valuable lives by his rashness, had given a signal triumph
to the Spaniards, and, worse than all, he had never penetrated to the mine, so as to bring back any proof of its
existence; a point of every consequence for bearing out
the assurances which Raleigh had given to the King.
That the mine had never been discovered by the Spaniards
themselves, was shown by Keymis's excuse, "that, if he
had persisted in making his way to it without force to
defend it, he should only have been opening the discovery
of it to the Spaniards."
   </p><p> The Adventurers who had followed the fortunes of
Raleigh, in expectation of acquiring vast riches, now began
to show discontent, and to excite mutiny among the
sailors. All spirit and energy was gone; there was not
a hope of success, and nothing remained but to abandon
the search, and return to England.  Raleigh reached
Plymouth in July, 1618, where, at the instance of Gondomar, he was immediately arrested by his own relative,
Sir Lewis Stukely, and conveyed a prisoner to the Tower.
Short and sad is the remainder of the story. His fate
was at once resolved; a vain attempt at escape only
increased the King's desire for his death; and so base
was James's deference to the Spaniards, that he actually
offered to deliver up Raleigh to be put to death in Spain,







<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>
according to King Philip's pleasure.  That monarch
wisely declined the office of executioner, leaving it to
Gondomar, to make sure of his victim in London. Accordingly, an order, under the Privy Seal, was directed to the
Judges of the King's Bench, commanding them to proceed
to execution against Sir W. Raleigh, under his former
sentence. In vain did he plead, that His Majesty's military commission as Marshal, placing him in command of
a royal fleet and army, with power of trial for life and
death, amounted, both in justice and reason, to a full
pardon of any former offence. Chief-Justice Montague
overruled the Plea; Yelverton, the Attorney-General,
declared, that fifteen years ago the prisoner had been convicted of treason, since which time His Majesty had
mercifully abstained from the infliction of the sentence;
but it was now the royal pleasure that it should be carried
out. Raleigh's pathetic appeal for even a few days' respite
was refused.
  </p><p>   He said, " My Lords, I desire but this much favour,
that I may not be cut off suddenly, but may be granted
some time to settle my affairs and my mind, for I have
somewhat to do in discharge of my reputation and conscience. I crave not this to obtain one minute of life,
for now, being old, sickly, disgraced, and certain to go to
death, my life is wearisome to me; and I further beseech
your Lordships, that when I go to die I may have leave
to speak freely." And he concluded with much solemnity,
" I take God to be my judge, before whom I shall shortly
appear, that I was never disloyal to His Majesty, which I



           <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

shall justify, where I shall not fear the face of any King
on earth; and so I beseech you all to pray for me."
  </p><p>  He was conducted to the Gatehouse Prison, and informed that he was to die next morning at nine, so eager
for his death was the heartless King.
  </p><p>  A last interview with his wife was the only favour
granted him; and we can well imagine what that parting
must have been to the loving and faithful partner of his
misfortunes. Fearful lest speaking of their surviving son
should add to her agony, he shortened this cruel hour by
affectionately entreating her to leave him. In floods of
tears she told him she had obtained the disposal of his
body. " It is well, Bess," he answered, smiling, " that thou
mayest dispose of that dead thou hadst not always the
disposing of when alive;" and then, tenderly embracing
her, he tore himself away, and devoted most of the night
to preparing a sort of manifesto of his innocence of every
charge which had been brought against him.
  </p><p>   His cheerfulness, piety, and resignation, were shown
in the few bitter hours which preceded his death next
morning. He received the Sacrament, breakfasted, and
smoked for a few minutes afterwards, as usual with him.
  </p><p>   Shortly before nine he was led to the scaffold erected
in Old Palace Yard, dressed in black, and bearing himself
with much dignity and composure.  So great was the
crowd and pressure, that he nearly fainted before he
could be got up to the scaffold.
   </p><p>  The Earls of Arundel, Oxford, and Northampton,
 Lords Doncaster, Percy, Sheffield, and other persons of







<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>

rank, were already assembled, all of whom he saluted with
his usual courtesy. In the brief address which he now
made, he entreated all present, if they saw any weakness
in him, to lay it to his ill-health, and not to fear.  " I
thank God," he said, " that of his goodness He hath
vouchsafed me to die in the sight of so noble an assembly,
and not in darkness, nor in the Tower, where I have
suffered so much adversity." His weakness here obliged
him to pause, and, turning to the Lords who sat in the
windows above him, he expressed his fear that they could
not hear him, on which Lord Arundel said he would come
down to him, as did also Lords Doncaster and Northampton; when, in a firmer tone, he spoke further, from
some notes he held in his hand, both generally as to his
innocence, and especially as to the slanderous report, that
he had stood in a window at Essex's execution, and
puffed out smoke from a pipe, in disdain of him. My Lord
of Essex, he said, never saw his face at all; for though he
was in the Armoury, he had retired back from his view.
" It was true," he said, " I was of the contrary faction,
and helped to pluck him down, but I knew him for a
noble gentleman, and always believed it would have been
better for me had his life been spared; for those who set
me against him, set themselves afterwards against me,
and were my greatest enemies."   After some further
speech with the Lords present, the scaffold was cleared,
and he bid the executioner show him the axe, and, feeling
its edge, said, " It is a sharp medicine, but a cure for all
diseases."




             <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

    </p><p>After a short internal prayer, he examined the
block to see the proper manner of placing himself, and
then quietly said that he was ready. When the Executioner came forward and asked his forgiveness, Raleigh
smiled, and " bade him be satisfied, but desired him not
to strike till he gave the signal, and then to fear nothing
and strike home." He kneeled, and laid his head on the
block; his lips were seen to move a little space as in
earnest prayer, and he then lifted his hand as the signal;
but, whether from not observing it, or from agitation, the
man delayed his stroke till Raleigh said in a clear voice,
" What dost thou fear ? strike, man !" The blow was then
given, but, though it deprived him probably of consciousness, it was not till a second stroke, that the head rolled
on the scaffold. It was observed that the body never
moved, and that the effusion of blood was unusually great,
as showing the vigour of his constitution, though lately so
enfeebled by care and illness.  The head, after being
held up to the people, with the words, " This is the head
of a traitor," was placed in a red bag, which was immediately wrapped in his velvet gown, carried to a mourning
coach, and conveyed to his unhappy wife, who caused it
to be embalmed, and preserved it with pious care till her
own death, which did not occur for near thirty years after
this tragedy.
  </p><p>  The records of the time make no allusion to any
display of military or other precautions against the chances
of tumult or rescue, and yet it seems strange that a man
of such renown, and prominent in that daring and love







<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>
of adventure so popular with the English, should have
fallen a victim to the Spanish influence over James,
without a hand being raised to save him.  So arbitrary
and illegal an exercise of royal power was a signal proof
of the altered power and condition of the nobility, which
the iron hand of Elizabeth, and the unbounded influence
she acquired over her subjects, had effected during her
long reign.</p>

        <p> The assassination of the Duke of Buckingham
           by Felton, which occurred at Portsmouth
           during his preparation for a second attempt
           to relieve the Hugonots in Rochelle, in 1628,
was at first supposed by the court, to be connected with
some general conspiracy, arising from the discontents
of the nation. The arbitrary and violent counsels of
Buckingham had, at this early period of Charles I.'s reign,
excited a spirit of great and deep-seated indignation; and
although Felton's act was committed out of personal
revenge, for the refusal of promotion when serving in the
Duke's previous expedition, it was deemed advisable to
make a searching investigation into all the details of the
murder, and for this purpose he was brought up to the
Tower.
 </p><p> At this period an examination in the Tower was invested with a certain mystery, connected with the known
existence of the rack in its gloomy dungeons; and
though that dreadful engine had again and again been
declared illegal, yet it was little more than twenty years
since its terrible powers had been employed, in endeavours



<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>

to extort confessions from Guy Fawkes. The
act of Felton was one, which might be regarded as
warranting any means within the limits of custom, if not
of law, for arriving at the truth. But on following out
the examination, it soon appeared that, although he had
excused the deed to his conscience as the justifiable
destruction of an enemy to public liberty, yet that revenge
for not receiving the promotion he believed to be due to
his military conduct, had been his real and only motive,
and that he had neither accomplices nor instigators.
Felton was tried before a common jury; and as he neither denied the crime, nor made any defence, but, on the
contrary, admitted his guilt, expressing the utmost penitence for what he had done, he was condemned and executed in the ordinary manner.
   </p><p>  It was currently reported, that during one of his examinations before the Council, when the Earl of Dorset
 menaced him with the rack, as by the King's order, he
 stoutly declared he did not believe that so good and
 gracious a Prince would allow his subjects to be tortured
 contrary to law. " I do affirm," he said, " upon my salvation, that my purpose was not known to any man;
 but," he added, "if you do put me on the rack, I will
 accuse you, my Lord of Dorset, and none but yourself."
 In that quaint old book, Aubrey's 'Miscellanies,' published in 1721, there is a wild story of the warning or
 prophecy by the ghost of Sir G. Villiers, father of the
 Duke of Buckingham, to an old friend of his, which may
 be introduced here as a sample of the marvellous credulity by which such a tale could gain circulation.



          <pb id="p.179" n="179"/>

Aubrey tells it as follows, with the remark that he had
heard it from others besides Sir W. Dugdale, whom he
quotes as his chief authority.
 </p><p>"To one Mr. Towes, who had been schoolfellow with
Sir G. Villiers, the father of the first Duke of Buckingham,
and was his friend and neighbour, as he lay in his bed
awake, and it was daylight, came into his chamber the
phantom of his dear friend Sir G. Villiers. Said Mr.
Towes to him, 'Why, you are dead. What makes you
here ?' Said the Knight, 'I am dead; but I cannot rest
in peace, for the wickedness and abomination of my son
George, at Court. I do appear to you to tell him of it,
and to advise and detort him from his evil ways.' Said
Mr. Towes, 'The Duke will not believe me, but will say
that I am either mad or doat.' Said Sir George, ' Go to
him from me, and tell him by such a token' (a mole he
had in some secret place, which none but himself knew
of). Accordingly, Mr. Towes went to the Duke, who
laughed at his message. At his return home, the phantom
appeared again, and told him ' that the Duke would be
stabbed' (he drew out a dagger) 'a quarter of a year after,
and you shall outlive him half a year; and the warning
that you shall have of your death will be, that your nose
will fall a bleeding.' All which accordingly fell out so.
This account I have had, in the main, from two or three;
but Sir W. Dugdale affirms what I have here taken from
him to be true; and that the apparition told him of
several things to come, which proved true; e.g. of a
prisoner in the Tower that should be delivered. This








<pb id="p.180" n="180"/>
Mr. Towes had so often the ghost of his old friend appear
to him, that it was not at all terrible to him. He was
Surveyor of the Works at Windsor (by the favour of the
Duke). Being there, sitting in the hall, he cried out,
'The Duke of Buckingham is stabbed !' He was stabbed,
as after was known, at that very moment that Mr. Towes
cried out."</p>

          <p>OF all the distinguished persons who had shown
          personal attachment to Charles I., and had
          most faithfully and devotedly served him, no
          man was more conspicuous than Wentworth
Earl of Strafford. Against him, therefore, above all the
servants of the King, was the vengeance of his enemies
directed.
  </p><p>  As Chief Governor of Ireland, Strafford showed a
vigour and energy which had much contributed to the
peace of that country; but in his determination to uphold
the laws, and to check the violence and anarchy which
too often prevailed in that country, it cannot be denied
that he had occasionally adopted counsels of an arbitrary
and barely legal character, of the notoriety of which his
enemies were not slow to take advantage.
  </p><p>  Haughty and cold in his manners, and accustomed
to have his commands promptly obeyed, the Earl was at
little pains to soften the rigour of his government by any
arts of conciliation; and his known and open opinions as
to the duties of subjects to their Princes, rendered him
one of the most formidable opponents to those doctrines








<pb id="p.182" n="182"/>
of resistance to illegal authority, which were daily gaining
ground in the nation.
   </p><p> Before quitting the government of Ireland, for his
successes in which country the King had created him an
Earl, Strafford left instructions for raising and equipping
an army of 8000 men to assist Charles in a fresh attempt
to reduce the Scotch to their obedience.
  </p><p>  Great complaints were made in England by the
Commons that Catholics had been enlisted in the
Irish army, and Charles was compelled to give orders
for the discharge of the few soldiers of that faith
who had joined the new levies.   Strafford was not
a man to disguise his sentiments on this or any other
proceedings of the Commons tending to curtail the
King's authority and powers; consequently he was
denounced as the "great apostate" from the cause of
the people, and so strong was the hatred expressed
against him personally, that many of his friends recommended him to avoid the approaching storm by withdrawing from the Court to his government in Ireland;
but to his fearless mind such advice appeared unworthy
of notice, and, as the King was desirous of his presence
and of the aid of his wisdom and firmness, he did not
hesitate to continue his attendance at the Court and
Council.
  </p><p>  The Commons well knew the value of such an
adviser to Charles, harassed as he was and uncertain
whom to mistrust and in whom to place his confidence.
The leaders of the popular party met early in November,
1640, to arrange their plans, and, after a debate with




     <pb id="p.183" n="183"/>

closed doors, the majority of the Commons proceeded
to the bar of the House of Lords, where Mr. Pym, their
spokesman, impeached Wentworth Earl of Strafford of
high treason.
 </p><p>   The Earl was informed of what had taken place in
the House of Lords while in conference with the King,
and hastened to the House; but on entering was met
with cries from the Peers of the popular side to withdraw.
The Lord Keeper at the same time desired him to kneel
at the Bar, and informed him that he was to consider
himself a prisoner in the custody of Black Rod till he
should clear himself of the impeachment which had been
now preferred against him by the Commons. An attempt
which he made to address the House from the Bar was
instantly silenced, and he was ordered to depart in charge
of the Usher.
   </p><p> It was about a month afterwards that Archbishop
Laud, who was as obnoxious to the Commons as his
friend Strafford, was in like manner impeached by them
at the Bar of the Lords, silenced in his attempt to speak,
and committed to the custody of Black Rod. A few
weeks after this (in January, 1641) Laud was committed
to the Tower, from whence neither he nor his unfortunate
friend was destined to issue more till they went to their
doom on Tower Hill.
  </p><p>   It was not till March (1641) that the arrangements
were finished and the charges prepared against Strafford,
whose trial was as usual to take place in Westminster
Hall before the Peers. Places were set apart for the
managers on the part of the House of Commons, for the







<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>

deputation who had come from Ireland with the accusations against him of illegal acts while Governor, and for
the Scots Commissioners, who charged him with intentions of transporting his Irish army to Scotland for its
subjection and plunder.  Galleries were also enclosed
behind the throne for the King, Queen, and Court to be
spectators of the solemn spectacle.
  </p><p>  Without entering into the detail of the charges
against the Earl, it may suffice to state that those from
Ireland related to illegal quartering of soldiers on the
inhabitants, and various acts of military oppression or
exaction. On behalf of the Scots, he was accused of
levying an army in Ireland expressly for the destruction
of constitutional liberty in Scotland; while with strange
inconsistency the Commons themselves charged him with
intending the Irish army for the subversion of the rights
and liberties of England.
  </p><p>  A number of minor acts were charged against the
Earl, of which no one, of itself, could be called treasonable, yet when accumulated into one charge they were
most unfairly represented, as amounting to the guilt of
high treason. But the most atrocious injustice towards
Strafford was the demand of the Commons that the
members of the King's Council, at the deliberations
of which he had assisted, should be absolved from
the secresy invariably observed there, and subjected to
separate examinations as to the illegal tendency of certain advice given by Strafford to the King in Council.
A document was produced by Vane the younger, purporting to be a note delivered at the Council Board, to




     <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>

the effect that, as the King had exhausted all ordinary
means of bringing his subjects to their obedience, His
Majesty was now justified in employing his Irish forces
for reducing this kingdom to obedience.
  </p><p>  It was plain that, if such advice were really given,
Scotland, and not England, must have been meant by the
words "this kingdom;" since it was solely on the state
of affairs in Scotland that the deliberation in question
had taken place, and the Lords who had been present
declared, on interrogation, that there had never been
mention that day but of Scotland, and further that they
could not remember any such paper as that produced by
Vane, being presented by Strafford on the occasion.
  </p><p>  As the trial proceeded, the weakness and vague
nature of the charges became daily more apparent, while
the dignity, moderation, and ability with which Strafford
conducted his defence was evidently producing a strong
influence in his favour among the majority of the Peers.
The managers of the Commons soon perceived the change,
and, a debate having taken place with closed doors, it
was announced that the impeachment was abandoned,
and that the House had resolved to proceed against
Strafford by a Bill of Attainder.
   </p><p> Pym read the paper above alluded to to the House,
which purported to be the original notes taken by Vane
the elder, Secretary to the Council, on the occasion in
question, and a Bill of Attainder against the Earl for
endeavours to subvert the liberties of the country was
formally introduced on the ground of those notes.
 </p><p>   Though the King's friends did their best to stem the








<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>

torrent of public feeling, it proved too strong for their
efforts, and within a fortnight the Bill of Attainder was
passed by the Commons. Meanwhile the Lords continued
the trial, and Strafford concluded his defence by a pathetic
and noble appeal to the sense of justice of his judges,
reminding them how his hard fate might befal any of
them if they sanctioned such perversion of right as that
of which he was now made a victim, and ending with the
beautiful words uttered by David in his affliction, " In te
Domine confido; non confundar in aeternum."
  </p><p>   Though the King sent his assurance to Strafford
that he would not forsake him, so great appeared the
danger of a general rising and tumult, that a proposal was
made to Balfour, Lieutenant of the Tower, to admit 100
picked Royalist soldiers, with the secret view of removing
Strafford to Newgate, and contriving a rescue by the way.
But Balfour stood true to his charge, refusing to open
his gates, and rejecting a large bribe which was afterwards offered him to connive at the Earl's escape.
  </p><p>   Charles now informed the two Houses of Parliament
 in a short speech that, had they condemned Strafford on
 fair proof, he would have allowed the law to take its
 course; but as he himself knew the falsehood of the
 evidence which had been brought forward of Strafford's
 illegal advice to him in Council, he could not give the
 Royal assent to the Attainder. The Bill had now come
 up to the Lords, and passed in a very thin House by a
 majority of 22 to 16, several of the Earl's friends being
 intimidated from attendance by the violence and menaces
 of the mob outside the House.




        <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>

   </p><p> That the King himself should have been affected by
fears of insurrection in the City seems hard to believe;
still harder is it to believe that he could ever have
consented to sacrifice the unhappy Strafford.  But
where is there a limit to the infirmity of human nature ?
On receiving from the Earl a letter, generously desiring
that no further risk should be incurred for his sake
by the King, and freely offering his life as the only
means now left for reconcilement with his people,
Charles, after consultation with Judges, Bishops, and
all whom he deemed fit counsellors in his distress and
difficulty, and who proved but too ready, with the
bright exception of Bishop Juxon, to avoid the responsibility of speaking in favour of Strafford, yielded his
assent to the Bill of Attainder, and the doom of his
devoted friend and follower was sealed.
  </p><p>  Little did the King suppose that the pious and
single-hearted Bishop, who ventured, on this emergency,
to give him such faithful and fearless counsel, would be
the consoler of his own last hours, when overtaken by
the fate to which he had now the weakness to abandon
Strafford.
  </p><p>  With tears and lamentation he signed the warrant;
and if proof were wanting of the distraction of Charles's
mind by the interior conflict he had endured, he now took
the truly hopeless step of sending the young Prince of
Wales to the House of Lords with a letter entreating that
both Houses would consent to the sentence of death
against Strafford being changed to one of imprisonment
for life. It may well be imagined that this petition was







<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>
treated with scorn, and even a reprieve for a few days
refused. The next morning Wentworth Earl of Strafford
was conducted to the scaffold on Tower Hill. He had
made it his dying request to Archbishop Laud to give him
his blessing as he should pass under the windows of his
prison (probably a room in the Bloody Tower just above
the gate). The venerable prelate raised his hands as
his unfortunate friend approached, but grief choked his
utterance: he gazed for a moment on the sad but undaunted countenance of the Earl, and sank back insensible on the floor of his prison. Strafford had faced death
too often in the field to show fear at its near approach,
even in the terrible form of a public execution.  He
made a brief speech from the scaffold, in which he said
that it was some satisfaction to him to know that the
King did not think he deserved to die, that he was not
guilty of the crimes laid to his charge, and that he forgave,
not merely in form, but from his very heart, all his
enemies. He then laid his head on the block, and at one
blow it was severed from his body. Vast crowds had
assembled to witness the execution: they behaved with
silence and decency, and those near the scaffold listened
to his last words with respect; but in the evening emissaries were sent out into the streets, who excited the mob
to make bonfires in the principal streets of the City, and,
with huzzas and shouts, to break the windows of those
whom they supposed to have been friendly to their
victim.

<p>
     AS it would be impossible to give a more simple
            and graphic account of Lord Capel's escape
            and unfortunate recapture than we find in
            the pages of Clarendon, his narrative shall
be here transcribed without alteration or comment.
</p><p>    "The Lord Capel, shortly after he was brought
prisoner to the Tower from Windsor Castle, had by a
wonderful adventure, having a cord and all things necessary conveyed to him, let himself down out of the window
of his chamber in the night, over the wall of the Tower,
and had been directed through what part of the ditch he
might be best able to wade.  Whether he found the
right place, or whether there was no safer place, he found
the water and the mud so deep that, if he had not been
by the head taller than other men, he must have perished,
since the water came up to his chin. The way was so
long to the other side, and the fatigue of drawing himself
out of so much mud so intolerable, that his spirits were
near spent, and he was once ready to call out for help, as
thinking it better to be carried back again to the prison,
than to be found in such a place, from whence he could
not extricate himself, and where he was ready to expire.







<pb id="p.190" n="190"/>

   </p><p> " But it pleased God that he got at last to the other
side, where his friends expected him, and carried him to
a chamber in the Temple, where he remained two or
three nights secure from any discovery, notwithstanding
the diligence that could not but be used to recover a man
they designed to use no better. After two or three days
a friend whom he trusted much, and who deserved to be
trusted, conceiving that he might be more secure in a
place to which there was less resort, and where there were
so many harboured who were every day sought after, had
provided a lodging for him in a private house in Lambeth
Marsh; and calling upon him in an evening, when it was
dark, to go thither, they chose rather to take any boat
they found ready at the Temple Stairs, than to trust one
of that people with the secret; and it was so late that
there was one only boat left there. In that the Lord
Capel (as well disguised as he thought necessary) and his
friend put themselves, and bid the waterman to row them
to Lambeth. Whether, in their passage thither, the other
gentleman called him  'my Lord,' as was confidently
reported, or whether the waterman had any jealousy by
observing what he thought was a disguise, when they were
landed, the wicked waterman undiscerned followed them,
till he saw into what house they went; and then went to
an officer and demanded, ' What he would give him to
bring him to the place where the Lord Capel lay ?' And
the officer promising to give him ten pounds, he led him
presently to the house, where that excellent person was
seized upon, and the next day carried to the Tower.
  </p><p>   " When the Petition that his wife had delivered to





                      <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>

the Parliament was read, many gentlemen spoke on his
behalf, and mentioned the great virtues which were in
him; and 'That he had never deceived them, or pretended to be of their party; but always resolutely declared
himself for the King;' and Cromwell, who had known
him very well, spoke so much good of him, and professed
to have so much kindness and respect for him, that all
men thought he was now safe, when he concluded, 'That
his affection to the public so much weighed down his
private friendship, that he could not but tell them that
the question was now, whether they would preserve the
most bitter and most implacable enemy they had; that
he knew the Lord Capel very well, and knew that he
would be the last man in England that would forsake the
Royal interest; that he had great courage, industry, and
generosity; that he had many friends who would always
adhere to him; and that as long as he lived, whatsoever
condition he was in, he would be a thorn in their sides;
and therefore, for the good of the Commonwealth, he
should give his vote against the Petition.' Ireton's hatred
was immortal: he spake of him, and against him, as of a
man of whom he was heartily afraid. Very many were
swayed by the argument that had been urged against
Duke Hamilton, 'That God was not pleased that he
should escape, because He had put him into their hands
again, when he was at liberty.' And so, after a long
debate, though there was not a man who had not a value
for him, and very few who had a particular malice or
prejudice towards him, the question being put, the negative was more by three or four voices: so that, of the







<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>

four Lords, three were without the mercy of that unmerciful people. There being no other Petition presented, Ireton told them, 'There had been    great
endeavours and solicitation used to save all those Lords;
but that there was a commoner, another condemned
person, for whom no man had spoke a word, nor had
he himself so much as petioned them; and therefore he
desired that Sir John Owen might be preserved by the
mere motive and goodness of the House itself;' which
found little opposition; whether they were satiated with
blood, or that they were willing, by this instance, that the
nobility should see that a commoner should be preferred
before them."
  </p><p>   The picture given in the above extract by Lord
Clarendon, conveys a dreadful impression of the dark
and gloomy hypocrisy of Cromwell's character, and the
unrelenting malice with which, by means of every wile and
subtlety, he pursued those persons whom he believed to
have been devoted to the unhappy monarch whom he
had brought to the scaffold.
  </p><p>   The description which follows of the execution of
Lord Capel, and the cool and brave composure with
which he addressed the bystanders before he met his
doom, shows that his virtue and spirit had not been overrated by the friend who has so eloquently praised him,
or by the enemy who, with a guile so infernal, contrived
to represent his great qualities as so many additional
arguments for bringing him to destruction.
   </p><p>  " The Lord Capel was then called, who walked
 through Westminster Hall, saluting such of his friends and



                <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>

acquaintance as he saw there, with a very serene countenance, accompanied with his friend Dr. Morley, who had
been with him from the time of his sentence; but at the
foot of the scaffold, the soldiers stopping the Doctor, his
Lordship took his leave of him, and, embracing him,
thanked him, and said he should go no farther, having
some apprehension that he might receive some affront
by that rude people after his death; the Chaplains who
attended the other two Lords being men of the time, and
the Doctor being well known to be most contrary.
  </p><p>  "As soon as his Lordship had ascended the scaffold,
he looked very vigorously about, and asked, 'Whether
the other Lords had spoken to the people with their hats
on?' and being told that 'they were bare,' he gave his
hat to his servant, and then, with a clear and a strong
voice, he said, ' That he was brought thither to dye for
doing that which he could not repent of: that he had
been born and bred under the government of a King
whom he was bound in conscience to obey, under laws
to which he had been always obedient, and in the bosom
of a church which he thought the best in the world:
that he had never violated his faith to either of those,
and was now condemned to dye against all the laws of
the land, to which sentence he did submit'
  </p><p>  "He enlarged himself in commending 'The great
virtue and piety of the King, whom they had put to
death, who was so just and merciful a Prince, and prayed
to God to forgive the nation that innocent blood.'
  </p><p>  "Then he recommended to them the present King,
who, he told them, was their true and their lawful sovereign,






<pb id="p.194" n="194"/>

 and was worthy to be so: that he had the honour
to have been some years near his person, and therefore
he could not but know him well; and assured them,
' That he was a Prince of great understanding, of an excellent nature, of great courage, an entire lover of justice,
and of exemplary piety: that he was not to be shaken
inhis religion, and had all those princely virtues which
could make a nation happy;' and therefore advised them
'To submit to his Government, as the only means to
preserve themselves, their posterity, and the Protestant
religion.' And having, with great vehemence, recommended it to them, after some prayers very devoutly
pronounced upon his knees, he submitted himself, with
an unparalleled Christian courage, to the fatal stroke,
which deprived the nation of the noblest champion it
had."
 </p><p>    Here follows one of those beautifully drawn characters in which Clarendon is so eminently successful.
  </p><p>   " The Lord Capel was a man in whom the malice of
 his enemies could discover very few faults, and whom his
 friends could not wish better accomplished; whom Cromwell's own character well described, and'who indeed
 would never have been contented to have lived under that
 Government. His memory all men loved and reverenced,
 though few followed his example. He had always lived
 in a state of great plenty and general estimation, having
 a very noble fortune of his own by descent, and a fair
 addition to it by his marriage with an excellent wife, a
 lady of very worthy extraction, of great virtue and beauty,
 by whom he had a numerous issue of both sexes, in which




               <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>

he took great joy and comfort; so that no man was more
happy in all his domestic affairs, and he was so much the
more happy in that he thought himself most blessed in
them.
 </p><p>   "And yet the King's honour was no sooner violated,
and his just power invaded, than he threw all those
blessings behind him; and having no other obligations to
the Crown than those which his own honour and conscience suggested to him, he frankly engaged his person
and his fortune from the beginning of the troubles, as
many others did, in all actions and enterprises of the
greatest hazard and danger; and continued to the end,
without ever making one false step, as few others did;
though he had once, by the iniquity of a faction that then
prevailed, an indignity put upon him that might have
excused him for some remission of his former warmth.
But it made no other impression upon him, than to be
quiet and contented whilst they would let him alone,
and with the same cheerfulness to obey the first summons
when he was called out, which was quickly after. In a
word, he was a man, that whoever shall, after him,
deserve best of the English nation, he can never think
himself undervalued, when he shall hear, that his courage,
virtue, and fidelity, is laid in the balance with, and compared to, that of the Lord Capel."</p>

<p>A SHORTtime after Charles II. had appointed Sir Gilbert Talbot to be " Master of
        the Jewel House" in the Tower, several of
           the allowances of his office were reduced,
and permission was given him, by way of compensation,
to admit the public, under certain restrictions, to view
the Regalia, paying the " Master" a regulated fee as his
perquisite.
  </p><p>  This liberty of access to the Jewel Office suggested
to one Blood, a disbanded officer of Cromwell's army, the
possibility of carrying off the crown and other valuables.
  </p><p>  Having dressed up a woman of decent and quiet
appearance to represent his wife, Blood attired himself
as a clergyman, with cloak and cassock, according to
the fashion of the time, and took her to the Tower, where
they asked permission to see the jewels. While Mr.
Talbot Edwards, the Deputy-Keeper, was showing them,
the lady pretended sudden sickness, and Mrs. Edwards
kindly asked her into their apartments, where she gave
her some cordial which appeared to restore her; and with
many thanks, the pretended clergyman and his wife took

            <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>

their leave, but not before Blood had availed himself of
the occasion, to take a careful view of the localities, and
to form his plan for the robbery.
  </p><p>  A few days after this he called with a present of
gloves from his supposed wife to Mrs. Edwards, in return
for her hospitality, telling her that his wife could talk of
nothing but the kindness of " those good people at the
Tower," and had desired him to mention, that they had a
ward (a nephew) with a comfortable little estate in the
country, and if such a match for their daughter would be
agreeable to the Edwardses, they would with pleasure do
their endeavour to forward it. Highly gratified by this
plausible offer, the Edwardses invited Blood to dine with
them that day, when he had the impudence to say a very
long grace, with great appearance of fervour, concluding
with a prayer for the King and Royal family. Noticing
a pair of handsome pistols hanging against the wall of
the parlour, he remarked that he should much like to
buy them, if Mr. Edwards did not object to part with
them, for a young friend in the army (his real object being
to remove any defensive weapons from the house). He
took his leave with a solemn benediction, and named a
day for bringing his nephew to be introduced to Miss
Edwards, requesting to be allowed to bring two country
friends at the same time, to see the Jewels, before they
returned to their homes. On the morning appointed,
May 9, 1671, he arrived with three respectably dressed
men, and as Mrs. Edwards and her daughter had not
yet come down stairs, he asked Edwards to show his
friends the Crown in the mean time. No sooner was this







<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>
wish complied with, than they threw one of their cloaks
over the old man's head, gagged him with a wooden plug
with a breathing hole, and tied it tight with a string at
the back of his neck. They then said they must have
the Crown, Globe, and Sceptre, which if he quietly surrendered, but not else, they would spare his life. Poor
Edwards, though eighty years old, instead of submitting
to their conditions, made desperate struggles to get free
and give the alarm, on which the villains gave him
repeated blows on the head with a wooden mallet, and
also stabbed him in the body, to silence his attempted cries.
Blood now seized the Crown, one accomplice (Parrott)
secreted the Globe, and the other proceeded, with a file
they had brought for the purpose, to divide the Sceptre into
two parts, for easier concealment; but at this moment the
third man, whom they had left on the watch at the door
below, gave an alarm, and in another moment Edwards's
son, who, by a most fortunate chance, had just arrived
from Flanders with Captain Beckman, his brother-in-law,
hastened up stairs to salute his family. The villains made
a rush past him, and, leaving the half-cut Sceptre behind
them, escaped with the Globe and Crown, pursued by young
Edwards and Beckman, shouting to stop the thieves.  A
warder at the drawbridge leading to the wharf, attempted
to arrest their progress, but Blood firing a pistol in his
face, he was so frightened, though the shot missed him,
that he fell as if killed, and they got clear away by the
wharf,and through the Iron Gate to St. Katherine's. At
a place near this gate, they had appointed horses to meet
them, and had nearly gained the spot, when Beckman,




     <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>

who was a fast runner, overtook them, and though Blood
fired another pistol at him, rushed upon him and seized
him, when young Edwards coming up, he was overpowered, after a hard struggle, and brought back prisoner
into the Tower.
 </p><p>   In this scuffle, the Crown, which Blood kept under
his cloak, was knocked out of his grasp on the pavement,
and a pearl and large diamond, with some stones of less
value, were displaced; but they were nearly all picked up
afterwards and restored.  Parrott, who had, like his
leader, been an officer in the Parliament's army, was
captured, as well as two or three others who were waiting
with the horses near St. Katherine's. This daring outrage
having been immediately reported to Charles II., he took
such interest in the matter, that he caused Blood and
Parrott to be conveyed to Whitehall, in order to examine
them himself.
   </p><p>  When brought before the King, Blood's impudence
was astonishing; not only did he acknowledge his recent
offence without shame, but he boasted of the part he had
taken some time before, in dragging the Duke of Ormond
out of his coach in St. James's Street, and carrying him
off to hang him at Tyburn, which was only prevented by
the fortunate chance of his servants overtaking his captors,
just in time for his rescue.
  </p><p>   But the strangest piece of effrontery in Blood, not
unmixed with a good deal of cunning, was his declaration
to the King, that he had been engaged in a conspiracy to
shoot him, when bathing near Battersea, being hidden
with a carbine among some rushes, for the purpose,






<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>

but " that his heart had been checked by an awe of
Majesty, which caused him not only to spare the King's
life, but to induce his associates also to abandon any further
attempts at his assassination. As to giving the names of
these associates, he said he would never betray a friend's
life, nor deny a guilt to save his own." He said he knew
the risk of such confessions, but "he had a large number
of friends bound together by the most solemn oaths, to
revenge each other's death, on whoever should bring them
to justice. If His Majesty would now spare him and his
accomplices in the Crown robbery, he would oblige the
hearts of many; and as he and his fellow prisoners had
shown that they could be daring in evil, so they would, if
pardoned, be found ready to do great service to the King."
At the termination of the examination, Blood and his
accomplices were remanded to the Tower, but after a
short imprisonment, were, to the astonishment of all,
released without trial.
  </p><p>   For this ill-timed and unwarranted clemency, it is
hard to assign any reason. To suppose that Charles was
really intimidated by Blood's tale of impending vengeance,
is quite inconsistent with his known courage in real
danger. Yet he was so fully aware of the wrong he was
committing, that he deemed an apology necessary to the
Duke of Ormond in respect of the outrage which Blood
had owned to having committed against his person. By
the King's orders, Lord Arlington conveyed to the Duke
a message " that it was His Majesty's pleasure that Blood
should not be prosecuted, for reasons which he was commanded to give him;" but the Duke cut him short by



    <pb id="p.201" n="201"/>

saying "that His Majesty's command was the only reason
that could be given, and therefore he need give him no
others. "
    </p><p> The circumstances of the outrage on the Duke of
Ormond were as follows :-Blood had been a leader in the
attempt to seize the Castle of Dublin, when the Duke of
Ormond was Governor, and had narrowly escaped the
gibbet on that occasion, by a hasty flight to England.
To revenge himself on the Duke, he laid a scheme to
attack him at night, when he was passing down St.
James's Street in his coach, and so far did he succeed,
that the Duke's life was at his mercy; but fortunately
Blood was bent on a refinement of vengeance, and
forcing the Duke to mount behind one of his associates,
carried him off across the fields (now the Green Park)
towards Tyburn, with the intention of there hanging him
on the common gibbet.
  </p><p>  After they had proceeded some distance, the Duke
collecting himself for a sudden effort, threw the man
behind whom he was bound, from his saddle, and
falling with him, a desperate struggle took place in
the mud, during which some of his servants arrived
to his rescue, and Blood, discharging a pistol at the
Duke without effect, galloped off and escaped in the
darkness, but not before the Duke had recognised his
features. Great suspicion was entertained, that the Duke
of Buckingham, who detested Ormond, had set Blood
upon this desperate attempt, and Lord Ossory, Ormond's
son, was so convinced of it, that in the presence of the
King and Court, he told him that he knew he was at the







<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>
bottom of Blood's attack on his father, "but," added he,
" I give you warning, if by any means my father comes to
a violent end, I shall consider you as the assassin; I shall
treat you as such; and wherever I meet you, I shall pistol
you, though you stood behind the King's chair, and I tell
it you in His Majesty's presence, that you may be sure I
shall not fail of performance."
 </p><p>   The strangest part of this affair was, that Blood
became a sort of hanger-on upon the Court at Whitehall,
and eventually had a pension given him, besides some
confiscated land in Ireland.
 </p><p>   Towards the close of his life, he became a Quaker,
and there was an old house at the corner of Peter Street,
Westminster, where the tradition existed that he died in
1680.
  </p><p>   Poor Edwards was but ill recompensed for the
courage he had shown and the ill treatment he had
received, of which he never entirely recovered, but died
in 1674, and was buried under the floor of the Tower
Chapel, with a small tablet over his grave. In one of
those reckless reparations which so often were allowed in
the Tower, the masons employed in repairing the Chapel
floor threw this tablet aside, but it was luckily observed
by Col. Wyndham in a heap of rubbish, and by the Constable's order fixed against the south wall, in safety from
future injury.</p>

<p>
          The fate of the Earl of Essex, who was found
            with his throat cut in the Tower, July 13,
         1683, on the morning of the day that Lord
            Russell was undergoing his trial for high
treason, was one of those mysteries, on which great
difference of opinion, or rather of conjecture, for a long
time prevailed.
  </p><p>  It is not easy to decide at the present time, the exact
position of the lodging where Lord Essex was confined
after he was brought to the Tower, from Cassiobury near
Watford, by the party of horse who were sent down to arrest
him. But, as it is described in the depositions before the
Commission assembled in King William's time, to investigate the matter, to have been "on the left hand as you
go up the mound, after passing Bloody Tower Gate,"
there can be little doubt but this building must have
stood at the southern part of the avenue of trees which
shade the paved walk on the parade, in front of the
Government House, and was probably pulled down when
the present roadway was made, and the steps and terrace
formed, opposite the main guard. In the depositions
above alluded to, it was stated that a sentinel was posted,







<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>

within some wooden railings in front of the door of
the Warder's lodging, where Lord Essex was confined.
This sentinel, when examined, prevaricated a good deal
in his evidence; denying at first, that any one had
entered the door, during the period of his watch, but
afterwards saying that two gentlemen had produced
an order for admission.  It must, however, be remembered, that the professed object of the Commission
was to cast a suspicion of murder on James II., and
that any assertion of this sort, however vague, would
be received with favour.  Not a word was said of
these mysterious visitors coming out again, but the next
occurrence mentioned by the sentinel was the alarm given
by Mr. Bommeney, the Earl's French valet, that he had
found his master on the floor of a closet next his bedroom,
with his throat just cut, and the body fallen against the
door, which opened inwards, in such a manner, that there
was much difficulty to push it open, from the weight lying
against it. The evidence chiefly relied upon, to prove
that Lord Essex did not kill himself, but died by other
hands, was the assertion of two children, who declared,
that as they were at play near this spot, they saw a hand
throw out a razor from Lord Essex's window, and that
a woman ran out of the door, a minute afterwards, and
picked it up.  But the sentinel had said nothing of
seeing either the children or the woman; and one of the
children was notorious among the neighbours for being
untruthful. It should be here observed that Charles II.
and the Duke of York had this same morning visited the
Tower, to make an inspection of the works, which coincidence
         <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

was much dwelt upon, as an evidence of foul play in
respect to Lord Essex. But in the first place, the proofs
which had come out lately of the intention of the contrivers of the Rye House Plot, to attack and seize the
Tower, as part of the plan for an insurrection in London,
were very likely to have induced the King and his
brother (who had much experience, from his service in the
Low Countries, of the strength and requirements of a
fortress) to examine the condition of the Tower defences.
On the other hand, could anything be less probable,
if they really had employed assassins to murder Lord
Essex, than that they should have visited the Tower at
the very hour, when their doing so might have induced
suspicion, and when common prudence would have suggested to them to keep out of the way, if they had authorized the commission of a crime, which would make so
much noise in the world ? Even admitting the evidence of
the children, which was anything but clear or decisive, to
have some weight, it must be recollected that numerous
instances have occurred of persons retaining the power of
moving, and walking about, in a surprising manner, after
inflicting injuries on themselves which very soon after
proved fatal. One case happened lately, of a woman in
Lambeth, whose husband had cut her throat, running down
stairs, and walking for a considerable distance along the
street, before she fell and expired. To have thrown the
razor, with which he had killed himself, from a window,
would therefore have been by no means inconsistent with
the fact of the Earl having committed suicide.
  </p><p>  In the 'Life of Lord Russell,' by the present Earl Russell,





<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>

 he makes allusion at some length to the mysterious
end of the Earl of Essex in the Tower, and states that he
had once been told by the late Earl of Essex (who died in
1839) that Mr. T. Grenville had assured him, that he had
seen in the old Treasury books, the entry of a pension to
Bommeney, the French valet; but he adds that he had
never been able to trace this entry, nor did Lord Essex
say what was its amount; neither did it appear, whether
it was granted before, or after, the death of the Earl.
If such a pension had existed, surely the active exertions
of Mr. Braddon the barrister, who got up the evidence
laid before the Commissioners in King William's time,
would not have allowed so material a fact to pass unnoticed, especially as the new government of King William
would have had every facility of placing in Braddon's
hands the details of the supposed grant or pension.
   </p><p>  It may be observed of the death of the Earl of
Essex, as of that of the Earl of Northumberland in
Elizabeth's reign, that there existed a prevalent notion
that a prisoner accused of high treason, might evade by
suicide the forfeiture of his estates to the Crown, inasmuch
as he died, without guilt being actually proved against
him. How far any such supposed evasion of the severity
of the Treason Laws really availed against the arbitrary
powers exercised by the Sovereign, before the Revolution of 1688, it is not easy to determine, but certainly
there was such an impression, and one can hardly suppose it would have existed, without some foundation
or precedent.</p>

<p>THE escape of the Earl of Nithisdale on the
           23rd of February, 17 6, the evening before
           the day fixed for his execution, is one of
           the most interesting events of the dark
history of the Tower.  It is hard to say whether the
wonderful ingenuity exercised by his heroic wife, in
contriving his escape, or her presence of mind under
circumstances of anxiety, sufficient to have shaken the
most undaunted courage, are most to be admired.
Winifred, Countess of Nithisdale, was the daughter
of W. Marquis of Powis. She was born about 1690, and
married early to Maxwell, Earl of Nithisdale.
  </p><p>  This Earl was one of the noblemen who were first
intrusted by the Earl of Mar, with the Pretender's
intended attempt on the crown of England; and took a
leading part in the assembly of the Jacobite nobles at
Braemar, where the plans for the invasion were finally
discussed and determined.
  </p><p>  After the action at Preston, the Earl of Nithisdale
was made prisoner, and conveyed on horseback with his
arms tied, and other indignities, to London, where he
arrived on the 9th December, 1715, and was committed






<pb id="p.208" n="208"/>

at once to the Tower, with several of his friends and
associates.
    </p><p> Lady Nithisdale was residing with her two young
children at the family seat of Terregles in Dumfriesshire, when the terrible news reached her of the defeat at
Preston, and of her husband's captivity and imprisonment
in the Tower. Instead of giving way to the terror and
distress with which such news would have overwhelmed
an ordinary mind, her first step was immediately to collect,
and bury in the garden, all family papers, which regarded
the estate; and then, attended only by her faithful maid
Evans, and a groom in whom she could place trust, she
set out on horseback (though she had never been much
accustomed to riding) for Newcastle; from whence a public
stage conveyed her to York. But here the snow was
so deep, that it was found impossible for the stage to
proceed. Nothing daunted, she betook herself again to
the saddle, and made her way, exposed to all the inclemency of the winter, and through roads which, bad at
all times, were then choked with snow, till she arrived
in London. From her rank and connexions, she had
many friends of rank and influence in the capital, among
whom were the Duchesses of Buccleuch and Montrose,
who at her request ascertained for her, through their
friends at court, whether there was any chance of intercession for Lord Nithisdale succeeding with George I.
The King had a great objection to him on account of
his profession of the Roman Catholic faith, and the report
of the two Duchesses was very unfavourable.
 </p><p>   Lord Nithisdale, however, could not be persuaded




   <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>

but that a petition to the King would have effect in his
favour. To'use her own words, Lady Nithisdale says:-
"I was convinced in my own mind that it would
answer no purpose; but as I wished to please him, I
desired him to have it drawn up, and I undertook that
it should come to the King's hands, notwithstanding all
the precautions he might take to avoid it. So the first
day I heard there was to be a drawing-room, I dressed
myself in black, as if in mourning, and sent for Mrs.
Morgan, the same who afterwards accompanied me to
the Tower, because, as I did not know his Majesty's
person, I might have mistaken some other of the court
for him. She stayed by me, and told me when he was
coming. I had also another lady with me, and we all three
remained in a room between the King's apartment and
the drawing-room, so that he was obliged to go through
it; and as there were three windows in it, we sat in the
middle one, that I might have time enough to meet him
before he could pass.
 </p><p>   "I threw myself at his feet, and told him in French
that I was the unfortunate Countess of Nithisdale, that
he might not pretend to be ignorant of my person. But
seeing that he wanted to go off, without taking my petition, I caught hold of the skirt of his coat, that he might
stop and hear me; he endeavoured to escape out of my
hands, but I kept such strong hold, that he dragged me,
upon my knees, from the middle of the room to the very
door of the drawing-room. At last one of the Blue Ribands
who attended his Majesty, took me round the waist, while
another wrested the coat from my hands. The petition,







<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>

which I had endeavoured to thrust into his pocket, fell
to the ground in the scuffle, and I almost fainted away
from grief and disappointment."
  </p><p> Although the Rebellion had been entirely suppressed,
yet there were so many persons interested in the cause of
the Stuarts, even among those whom the King believed
most faithful to him, that already several prisoners had
made their escape from prisons in the country, and some
had even succeeded in London.
  </p><p>  An escape from the Tower being the only chance
now left for her husband's life, Lady Nithisdale bent the
whole force of her mind to this object, resolving to have
no confidant of her scheme, except the faithful maid,
who had attended her on her venturous ride from Scotland. No time was to be lost, for the trial of the rebel
lords had commenced on the 9th of February, and sentence having been passed on the 19th, they now lay in
the Tower awaiting their execution, which was fixed for
the 24th.
  </p><p>   Numerous petitions were however prepared and presented to both Houses of Parliament, for intervention
with his Majesty. The petition to the Commons was
stopped, by a motion for adjournment, carried by the
small majority of seven votes.
   </p><p>  In the House of Lords, where some of the unfortunate nobles had many personal friends, the motion for
reading the petitions was carried against the ministry by
nine voices.
   </p><p>  A question was then raised whether the King had
power to reprieve in cases of impeachment ? This was

       <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

 carried in the affirmative, and strong hopes were consequently entertained for the prisoners; but when it came
 to the wording of the Address to the King on behalf of
 the prisoners, the Whig Ministry prevailed (though only
 by five voices) for the adoption of terms, which, in point
 of fact, left the matter much as it stood before; for the
 Address only petitioned his Majesty to " reprieve such of.
 the condemned lords as deserved his mercy," the period
 of respite being also left to his Majesty's discretion.
  </p><p>   The stern reply of the King to this Address left
small hopes for the prisoners, for he merely answered that
on this and all occasions he would do what he thought
most consistent with the dignity of his Crown, and the
safety of his people.  Nor did he confine himself
to this virtual rejection of the Address; for shortly afterwards he commanded several persons who had taken part
in both Houses for the prisoners to be dismissed from
offices which they held under the Crown. The issue
of this debate, on the very eve of the day appointed
for her husband's execution, would have overwhelmed
a less bold and elastic spirit than that of Lady Nithisdale, but, with incredible presence of mind, she hastened
to avail herself of the fact of the Address, even such
as it was, having been carried at all; and taking coach
directly for the Tower, presented herself at the gates,
with a face of gladness, telling the warders, as she passed
to Lord Nithisdale's apartment, that there was now
no longer fear for the prisoners, since the motion to
address the King had just passed in the House of Lords,
giving them, at the same time, some money to drink to







<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>
its success.  She remained with Lord Nithisdale no
longer than was necessary to explain to him the real
truth, and to instruct him as to the part he was to play
in her plan for his escape, and then returned quickly
to the lodgings which she had hired in Drury Lane.
   </p><p> It was not the least remarkable part of this lady's
character, that, delicate and feminine in appearance as
she is represented in the picture by Sir G. Kneller,
in possession of the family, she possessed that power
over the minds of others which belongs more usually
to men early accustomed to command, and long versed
in the vicissitudes of life. With that self-reliance so
peculiar to her, she resolved on a step, which seemed
as rash and imprudent at first sight, as it afterwards
proved the contrary. Having observed pretty closely the
character of a Mrs. Mills, of whom she had hired lodgings
in Drury Lane, she sent for her to her own apartment,
and informed her that, all hope of pardon being now
lost, she had determined on a scheme to effect Lord
Nithisdale's escape from the Tower. "This," she said,
"is the last night before his execution;" and then passionately appealed to her feelings, to assist her in the
attempt she meditated, by accompanying her at once
to the Tower, in order that Lord Nithisdale might
escape in one of her dresses, for which scheme she had
arranged every detail, and had even secured the dress
and carried it to the Tower.
   </p><p>  Meantime she had sent for another person (who
appears to have been of the same station in life as Mrs.
Mills), a Mrs. Morgan, who presently was hurried into




      <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>

a similar consent as the kindness of her feelings had extorted from Mrs. Mills. "Their surprise and astonishment,"
to use Lady Nithisdale's own words, " made them consent,
without thinking of the consequences." A coach was
called, and all three started for the Tower, Lady Nithisdale
talking all the way, for fear they should have time for
reflection, and change their minds. As they drove along
she explained the details of her scheme, namely, that Mrs.
Morgan was to wear over her own clothes a dress of
Mrs. Mills's (who was a large woman), for Lord Nithisdale to put on, with other disguise, and so pass the
Warders stationed in his outer room and at the gate.
 </p><p>   Lady Nithisdale's own account, in a letter to her
sister, of what now took place, shall be literally transcribed. " On our arrival, I first brought in Mrs. Morgan,
as I was only allowed to introduce one at a time, calling
her a friend of my lord's, come to take leave of him.
When Mrs. Morgan had taken off the dress of Mrs.
Mills's which she had brought for my purpose, I conducted her back to the staircase, and, in going, I begged
her to send my maid to dress me, as I was afraid of
being too late to present my last petition that night,
if she did not come immediately. I despatched her
safe, and went partly down stairs, to meet Mrs. Mills,
who held her handkerchief to her face, as was natural
for a person going to take a last leave of a friend before
his execution; and I had desired her to do this, that my
lord might go out in the same manner. Her eyebrows
were inclined to be sandy, and as my lord's were dark,
and thick, I had prepared some paint to disguise him.






<pb id="p.214" n="214"/>
I had also got an artificial head-dress, of the same
coloured hair as hers, and rouged his face and cheeks,
to conceal his beard, which he had not time to shave.
All this provision I had before left in the Tower. The
poor guards, whom my slight liberality the day before
had endeared me to, let me go quietly out with my
company, and were not so strictly on the watch as
they usually had been; and the more so, as they were
persuaded, from what I had told them the day before,
that the prisoners would obtain their pardon. I made
Mrs. Mills take off her own hood, and put on that which
I had brought for her. I then took her by the hand,
and led her out of my lord's chamber; and, in passing
through the next room, in which were several people,
with all the concern imaginable I said, 'My dear Mrs.
Catherine, go in all haste, and send me my waitingmaid; she certainly cannot reflect how late it is. I am
to present my petition to-night, and if I let slip this
opportunity I am undone, for to-morrow is too late.
Hasten her as much as possible, for I shall be on thorns
till she comes.'  Everybody in the room, who were
chiefly the guards' wives and daughters, seemed to compassionate me exceedingly, and the sentinel officiously
opened me the door. When I had seen her safe out
I returned to my lord, and finished dressing him. I had
taken care that Mrs. Mills did not go out crying, as
she came in, that my lord might better pass for the lady
who came in crying and afflicted; and the more so as he
had the same dress that she wore. When I had almost
finished dressing my lord, I perceived it was growing dark,



     <pb id="p.215" n="215"/>

and was afraid that the light of the candles might betray
us, so I resolved to set off. I went out leading him by
the hand, whilst he held his handkerchief to his eyes.
I spoke to him in the most piteous and afflicted tone,
bewailing bitterly the negligence of my maid Evans,
who had ruined me by her delay. Then I said, 'My
dear Mrs. Betty, for the love of God, run quickly and
bring her with you; you know my lodging, and if you
ever made despatch in your life, do it at present; I
am almost distracted with this disappointment.' The
guards opened the door, and I went downstairs with
him, still conjuring him to make all possible despatch.
As soon as he had cleared the door, I made him walk
before me, for fear the sentinel should take notice of
his walk, but I continued to press him to make all
the despatch he possibly could. At the bottom of the
stairs I met my dear Evans, into whose hand I confided
him. I had before engaged Mr. Mills to be in readiness
before the Tower, to conduct him to some place of safety
in case we succeeded. He looked upon the affair as
so very improbable to succeed, that his astonishment,
when he saw us, threw him into such a consternation
that he was almost out of himself, which, Evans perceiving, with the greatest presence of mind, without
telling Lord Nithisdale anything, lest he should mistrust
them, conducted him to some of her own friends on
whom she could rely, and so secured him, without which
we certainly should have been undone. When she had
conducted him, and left him with them, she returned
to Mr. Mills, who had by this time recovered himself






<pb id="p.216" n="216"/>

from his astonishment. They went home together, and
having found a place of security, brought Lord Nithisdale to it. In the mean time, as I had pretended to
have sent the young lady on a message, I was obliged
to return upstairs and go back to my lord's room in
the same feigned anxiety of being too late, so that
everybody seemed sincerely to sympathize in my distress.
When I was in the room, I talked as if he had been
really present. I answered my own questions in my
lord's voice, as nearly as I could imitate it, and walked
up and down, as if we were conversing together, till
I thought they had time enough thoroughly to clear
themselves of the guards. I then thought proper to
make off also. I opened the door and stood half in
it, that those in the outward chamber might hear what
I said, but held it so close that they could not look
in. I bade my lord formal farewell for the night, and
added, that something more than usual must have happened to make Evans negligent, on this important occasion, who had always been so punctual in the smallest
trifles; that I saw no other remedy than to go in person;
that if the Tower was then open, when I had finished
my business, I would return that night; but that he
might be assured I would be with him, as early in the
morning, as I could gain admittance into the Tower,
and I flattered myself I should bring more favourable
news. Then, before I shut the door, I pulled through
the string of the latch, so that it could only be opened
in the inside. I then shut it with some degree of force,
that I might be sure of its being well shut. I said to the


      <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>

servant, as I passed by (who was ignorant of the whole
transaction), that he need not carry in candles to his
master, till my lord sent for them, as he desired to finish
some prayers first."
  </p><p>  So far the courage and ingenuity of Lady Nithisdale
had succeeded beyond expectation; it now remained for
her and her husband to gain some safe retreat, as the
deception must, within a few hours, be discovered, and an
active search was sure to be set on foot.
  </p><p>  Lady Nithisdale got the first coach she could find,
and drove to her lodging in Drury Lane, where Mrs.
Mills had already arrived.
  </p><p>  It must be observed here, that one of the cleverest
parts of Lady Nithisdale's scheme, was the employment
of assistants totally unknown, and who, from the insignificance of their position, ran no real risk when once clear
of the Tower Gates.
   </p><p> At Mrs. Mills's she found Mr. Mackenzie, a friend
by whose hands she had intended originally to send her
petition to the Lords-" There is no need," she joyfully
exclaimed to him, " of a petition now; my lord is safe
out of the Tower, and the hands of his enemies, though
as yet I know not where he is."
  </p><p>  She now took a chair, and proceeded to her faithful
friend the Duchess of Buccleuch; but learning she had
company with her, went on to the Duchess of Montrose,
who had also company, but, being privately told who was
arrived, quitted them instantly to see and console, as
she supposed, her unhappy friend. The Duchess, to her
astonishment, found Lady Nithisdale in a transport of

        <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>

own room, till Wednesday (a period of three days), on
which morning the Ambassador's coach and six was to
set out for Dover, to fetch his brother to London.
  </p><p>  Lord Nithisdale put on a livery, and went down in
the retinue, without the least suspicion, to Dover, where
Mr. Mickel, which was the name of the Ambassador's
servant, hired a small vessel, in which, accompanied by
Lord Nithisdale, he immediately sailed for Calais. The
passage was so remarkably short, that the Captain made
the remark "that the wind could not have served
better, if the passengers had been flying for their lives,"
little thinking such to be really the case. To return to
Lady Nithisdale: the solicitations of her friends, and the
interest taken in her cause by persons on both sides
of politics, prevailed no further with the hard nature of
the King, than to obtain the assurance, that unless seen
in England or Scotland, she should not be molested.
But this concession would in no way protect her son's
estate from waste and plunder. The family papers, as we
have seen, she had buried in the garden at Terregles;
and to get them safe out of the country was now her
object. "As I had hazarded my life for the father," she
wrote to her sister, "I could not do less than hazard
it once more for the son."
  </p><p>  Whether she adopted any disguise does not appear,
but she bought three saddle-horses, and attended only by
her faithful Evans and the trusty groom she had brought
before from Scotland, she left London for the north,
putting up at small roadside alehouses, for fear of recognition in the English towns. Could she once reach her




















<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>
own county, she relied on the attachment and respect of
her neighbours for not betraying her; nor was her ingenuity and resource ever at fault, for, on arriving in Traquhair, she announced that she had come home, with the
leave of Government, and on arriving at her own house,
she issued invitations to her neighbours to come and
visit her. That same night however she dug up the
buried papers, and despatched them by a trusty hand
for London; and not a moment too soon; for the
magistrates of Dumfries, beginning to doubt her story,
had resolved to insist on her producing the passport
which she pretended to possess.  Before daybreak this
indefatigable lady was again in the saddle, and made her
way to London, with the same secrecy as she had left it.
         <quote>   " Spotless without, and innocent within,
              She feared no danger, for she knew no sin."
</quote>
   </p><p>    Rumours, however, of her journey had reached the
  ears of the King, who, to his shame, was only roused to
  greater anger than before against her. He declared " that
  Lady Nithisdale did whatever she pleased in spite of
  him; and that she had given him more trouble than any
  woman in Europe." A strict search for her retreat was,
  by his orders, again set on foot, and to have remained
  longer in London, would have been to tempt that Providence which had watched over her safety in so marvellous
  a manner. She accordingly made up her mind to abandon
    any further ideas of intercession, and to rejoin her husband
    abroad, with whom she lived a retired life at Rome till
    his death in 1744. His admirable wife did not long





    <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>

survive him, and died also at Rome, but her remains
were brought to England, and were buried at Arundel
Castle.
  </p><p>Her picture, by Sir G. Kneller, in the bloom of youth,
is still at Terregles, and has been thus described by a
lady of the Maxwell family. " Her hair is light brown,
slightly powdered, with large soft eyes, regular features,
and a fair pale complexion. Her soft expression and
delicate appearance give little indication of the strength
of mind and courage she displayed. Her dress is blue
silk with a border of cambric, and over it a cloak of
brown silk."
 </p><p>   As doubts have existed as to the locality in the
Tower, from whence Lord Nithisdale's extraordinary
escape was made, some pains have been taken to ascertain a point of such interest, by examination and comparison of the probable places of his confinement. It
would appear from Lady Nithisdale's letter, that the
chamber in which the Earl was imprisoned, opened into
a sort of lobby, where the Warders in charge were stationed, and that from this lobby or antechamber, there
was a staircase leading down to the outer door of the
house, or prison, where Lord Nithisdale was confined.
 </p><p>   Now this description would not apply at all to the
State Prison, known as the Beauchamp Tower; nor
indeed was it the custom at this period to confine noblemen in any of the ordinary prisons or dungeons of the
Tower. They were usually given in charge to a Warder,
and lived in his quarters, the windows and doors of
which were barred securely with iron, as may still be





<pb id="p.222" n="222"/>
<figure id="Fig.054" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00054"><head>COUNCIL CHAMBER IN GOVERNOR'S HOUSE.</head></figure>

seen in the quarters of the Middle Tower, and other
old residences of the Warders. The custom of giving
prisoners in charge to individuals prevailed also in
France, as appears by the Memoirs of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, where we read of persons of
distinction being placed " aux arrets," in the custody
of an Exempt of the Royal Guard (from which word
Exempt that of Exon in the Queen's "Body Guard"
is no doubt a corruption, the meaning being an under
officer " exempt" from sentinel's duty).
   </p><p> But in the Tower, prisoners of rank were often
received as inmates of the. Governor's own house, where,
besides several upper rooms, from which escape would
be difficult, there is in the Bell Tower connected with
the upper story, a strong vaulted prison-room, known as
the scene of the harsh confinement of Bishop Fisher in
Henry VIII.'s reign. Now in this upper story of the
Lieutenant's house, there are two rooms opening into a
large apartment known as the Council Room, either of
which rooms would answer the local description given by
Lady Nithisdale in her narrative; supposing the Warders
on duty to have been posted in the large Council Room,
where she mentions that several of their wives and
daughters had assembled from compassion, or curiosity,
to see her, and her friends, pass into the inner chamber
to visit Lord Nithisdale.
 </p><p>   From the " Council Room," there is a lobby or
passage about twenty-five feet long leading to the head
of the stairs, which descend to the lobby of the first floor,
and thence down into the Entrance Hall; every part of




     <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>

which localities correspond, so closely, with the details of
Lady Nithisdale's narrative, that there can be little doubt
of the Governor's House having been the scene of this
truly wonderful escape.
  </p><p>  Lord Nithisdale's unfortunate friends, Lords Derwentwater, Widdrington, Wintoun, Carnwath, Kenmure,
and Nairn, who had all pleaded guilty except Wintoun,
were condemned to die as traitors.  They had been
brought into London on horseback with every degradation, their arms tied behind them, their horses led by
soldiers and preceded by drums and music as a sort of
triumph over their misfortunes. Lord Nairn was saved
by the friendly efforts of Lord Stanhope, who had been
his schoolfellow at Eton; but all the interest made for
the rest was vain.
  </p><p>  Steele, the friend of Addison, pleaded eloquently
for mercy in the Commons; but Walpole, though naturally a humane man, held that example was indispensable, and declared " that he was moved with indignation
to see that there should be such unworthy members of
this great body, who can, without blushing, open their
mouths in favour of rebels and parricides."  The efforts
made for the prisoners in the House of Lords have
already been alluded to; and though the Minister would
concede nothing as regarded the other noblemen, Lords
Carnwath and Widdrington were respited in deference
to the feelings expressed in the Commons.
  </p><p>  Finally, none but Derwentwater and Kenmure were
left for execution, and appointed to suffer on Tower Hill.
Derwentwater, who was the first to suffer, behaved with



<pb id="p.224" n="224"/>

much composure and firmness.  He declared that he
died a sincere Catholic; that his intention had been
what he believed best for his country; that he died in
charity with all, even with those of the Government who
had been most forward for his death.
 </p><p>   It is recorded that on trying his neck upon the block
he found a rough place which hurt his chin, and quietly
asked the headsman to chip off the projection with his
axe before he laid him down to receive the blow. He
desired the man to strike when he should hear him say
" Lord Jesus receive my soul ;" and taking off his coat
and waistcoat, placed his neck carefully on the block,
and then giving the signal, one blow caused his head
to roll on the scaffold.
 </p><p>    Lord Kenmure then ascended the platform, and,
behaving with the same courage and resolution as his
friend, made a declaration to the same purport; but
added that he regretted having admitted himself guilty on
his trial, and offered a short prayer for King James III.
It was not till the second stroke that his head fell; but
the first had probably extinguished all sensation.
  </p><p>   Lord Wintoun contrived to retard his trial by various
pretexts and delays; when at last these resources were
exhausted, he declared that he had witnesses in his favour
who were retarded by the badness of the roads from
Scotland.
   </p><p>  With the injustice usual in trials for treason at that
time, no counsel was allowed him, against which hard
rule he urgently but vainly remonstrated. Lord Cowper,
the High Steward, having checked him with some harshness,
     <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>

<figure id="Fig.055" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00055"><head>VAULT UNDER WAKEFIELD TOWER.</head></figure>
he said, " I hope, my Lord, you will give me justice,
and not make use of Cowper-Law, as we used to say in
Scotland-hang a man first and then judge him."
  </p><p>  He was found guilty, and sent back to await his doom
in the Tower; but the same cunning and shrewdness
which had enabled him to stave off his trial, stood him
in such good stead, that shortly before the day fixed for
his execution he managed to escape from prison, and,
being well seconded by friends of the cause in London,
was conveyed safely to the Continent. There is no record,
or tradition, of the manner of Lord Wintoun's escape;
though it was probably even more difficult to accomplish than that of Lord Nithisdale, from the better precautions we may suppose to have been adopted in the
Tower to prevent escape of State prisoners.

      <p>  THE last occasion on which the headsman's
           block, still preserved in the Tower, was
           used for its dreadful purpose, was the execution of the celebrated Simon Fraser, Lord
Lovat, for the part taken by him in the Rebellion of '45.
The three other Lords sentenced for their part in the
same rebellion had given little trouble at their trials.
The Earls of Cromarty and Kilmarnock, seeing the
strength of the evidence about to be brought against
them, pleaded guilty at once, and humbly entreated that
their lives might be spared. Cromarty pathetically appealed to the Lords on the plea of his unhappy wife and
eight children; Kilmarnock appealed for mercy on grounds
which seem far more extraordinary, for he attributed to
the excellent principles of loyalty, in which he had educated his eldest son, that the young man had actually
fought against him on the Royal side at Culloden ! and
argued that this fact should be considered in his own
favour.
    </p><p>  Cromarty received a pardon, but Kilmarnock was
  ordered for execution.
   </p><p>   Balmerino, a man of high spirit, and convinced in

  <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>

his heart that he had fought in the good cause, made no
submission, and after an attempt, which was overruled by
the Judges, to disprove his presence in Carlisle on the
day named in the indictment, gave up any further defence,
and prepared to die with the same courage as he had
shown through life.
 </p><p>   Kilmarnock and Balmerino suffered upon Tower Hill
in August, 1745, the former avowing his error and expressing remorse for his offence, while his companion
boldly cried out "God save King James !" on his way
through the gates to Tower Hill, and declared, before he
laid his head on the fatal block, that if he had a thousand
lives he would lay them down in the same cause.
  </p><p>  The trial of Lord Lovat was delayed till March of
1746, owing to some difficulties of procuring evidence;
for though no one had shown more energy in the Pretender's cause, Lovat had never been seen in arms against
the Crown, nor in the commission of any overt act of
treason. But John Murray, who had been Secretary to
Prince Charles, had the baseness to place in the hands of
Government, as the price of his own safety, a number
of letters from Lovat to the Prince, which, with other corroboration, furnished unquestionable proofs of his guilt.
  </p><p>  He conducted his own defence with a mixture of
shrewdness and buffoonery which produced anything but
a favourable impression upon the Peers who tried him.
H. Walpole, who was present at the trial, observes, " I did
not think it possible to feel so little as I did at so melancholy a spectacle; but tyranny and villany, wound up
by buffoonery, took off all edge of compassion." At his


<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>

execution Lord Lovat behaved with wonderful coolness,
remarking to the crowd who pressed round the coach of
the Lieutenant of the Tower, in which he was carried
through the gate to Tower Hill, that they need not be in
a hurry, for there would certainly be no sport till he
himself arrived.
   </p><p>  He appeared to pay serious attention to a Catholic
priest who administered to his last moments, and repeated
from Horace, "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori;"
though, as Lord Stanhope has justly observed in his
History, no man was ever less strongly imbued with that
noble sentiment, except perhaps its writer.
    </p><p> The coffin-plates of Lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino,
 and Lovat were discovered about twenty-five years ago,
 when a quantity of bones were disinterred for the purpose
 of excavating the foundations of the present barracks.
   </p><p>   They were thrown aside with the same carelessness
 as the gravestone of Talbot Edwards; but fortunately
 discovered by an officer of the Tower and placed in the
 vestry, where they are now carefully secured from accident
 in glass cases.</p>

<p>
        AMONG the last State prisoners confined in
           the Tower were some of the desperate men,
           who had engaged in what is commonly
           known as the Cato Street Conspiracy. The
leader was one Thistlewood, who had been in Paris at the
time of Robespierre, and had probably there imbibed those
revolutionary opinions which eventually led him to the
gallows.  He had served a short time as an officer of
the militia, and afterwards in the army. After quitting
the service he had made himself notorious in Watson's
attempt at a riot in London, in the year 1818 (on which
occasion he was brought to trial at the same time as
Watson, but obtained an acquittal. On his release he
sent a challenge to the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth,
who placed the case in the hands of a magistrate, and
he underwent a short imprisonment in consequence). On
his release in 1819, he did not take part in the ordinary
mobs and riots of that year, but, entertaining more determined views, he contrived to collect around him thirty
or forty discontented followers, from the class of workmen
and London idlers; and by his influence and popular




<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>
discourses at meetings of a treasonable description, obtained great authority over them.
   </p><p> It never appeared that he had any definite plan for
organising a provisional government in event of success;
he relied upon the state of extreme confusion which he
expected to produce in London, in order to overthrow
the existing authorities; and his scheme for this purpose was of a nature as bloody and cruel as it was
absurd. Having hired a loft over an uunoccupied stable,
in a court called Cato Street (the name of which has
since been altered to "Homer Street"), near the Edgeware Road, and communicating with John Street and
Queen Street, he proceeded to hold nightly meetings
there, which were attended, at most, by twenty-five or
thirty persons; the loft being too confined to contain
larger numbers. He had managed to persuade these
men that if they could accomplish a wholesale and simultaneous murder of all the Cabinet Ministers, the executive
would be so totally paralysed, that possession might be
taken of the Tower, the Bank, and Government Offices,
by which time the numbers and force of their partisans
would be so increased, that all further opposition might
be easily overborne. He assured his followers that the
troops in the barracks would retire or be overpowered,
and that London would in a few hours be in the possession of the conspirators.
   </p><p>  As the first step, it was resolved to collect arms, and
to prepare hand grenades and other explosive machines,
while those who were most in Thistlewood's confidence
were charged to be on the look-out for active and

       <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>

determined associates, who should be ready, on a preconcerted signal, to take a lead in the riot, and guide the
mob in the proper direction for their purposes.
  </p><p>  A Cabinet dinner appeared to Thistlewood to be
the best opportunity for the outbreak. All the Ministers
would then be assembled, and being, many of them,
elderly and infirm persons, defenceless and unprepared,
might be slaughtered without noise, and in a very short
space of time.  Having ascertained that one of these
dinners was about to take place at the Earl of Harrowby's, in Grosvenor Square, a part of the town very
quiet at that time of day, and removed from any civil
or military protection, he laid his plan in the following
manner:-
  </p><p>  Soon after eight o'clock in the evening the party
selected for the attack were to issue, by twos and threes,
from the loft in Cato Street, armed with daggers, pistols,
and combustibles of a portable nature, and moving by
different routes, so as not to attract notice, were to assemble along the railings on the south side of Grosvenor
Square. One man was to keep watch near the diningroom windows of Lord Harrowby's house (No. 39), with
a view of ascertaining when the servants should withdraw, after putting the dessert upon the table.  On a
certain signal two of the stoutest of the gang, armed
with daggers, were to ring the bell, and, on the porter
opening the door, were instantly to stab him, and, followed by eight or ten of their comrades, to rush into
the dining-room. Each of the conspirators was then to
seize and despatch one of the Ministers, while one or two






<pb id="p.232" n="232"/>
others should place themselves with pistols, at the top of
the stairs leading down to the offices, and thus prevent any
of the servants coming up, to the rescue. Not a moment
was then to be lost in cutting off the heads of their
victims, which they were to fix on poles, prepared for the
purpose, and they were immediately to form a procession,
and parade through the streets, with the heads carried
in front, by Charing Cross, along the Strand, and eastward towards the City. Strange as it must now appear,
there can be no doubt, from various evidence adduced
upon their trial, that these misguided wretches were
firmly convinced that an immense mob would at once
follow and join them, and that before midnight the Bank,
the Tower, the Mint, and all the important points of
London would be in their possession.
 </p><p>    Now if one thing could be devised more likely than
another to set against them even the most turbulent of
the London mob, it would have been that on which
they chiefly relied, the exhibition of a number of bloody
heads in the front of their procession.  Nevertheless,
whatever failure might have attended their schemes,
there can be little question, that these desperadoes would
have destroyed many valuable lives, and thrown the town
into frightful confusion, had not a providential revelation
caused the detection and prevention of their scheme at
a critical stage of their proceedings.
  </p><p>   About a week before the day fixed for the Cabinet
 dinner above mentioned, as the Earl of Harrowby was
 riding slowly through the Park on his way to his office in
 Downing Street, a man of respectable appearance stepped


    <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>

from the foot-path, and, touching his hat, requested a few
minutes conversation with his lordship, on a matter, which
he averred was of great consequence to the Government.
 </p><p>   Lord Harrowby paid little attention to the man,
and telling him he could not listen to such matters there,
trotted on, supposing his request to be a mere preamble
to some begging imposture.
  </p><p>  But a day or two afterwards, at about the same time
and place, the man again presented himself, and was so
urgent in his assurance, that it was a matter of deep importance to Government, and regarded a great impending
danger to the State, that Lord Harrowby was induced to
appoint an hour next morning to receive him, and hear
what he had to say. Meantime he deemed the communication of sufficient importance to mention it at a Cabinet
Council which happened to meet the same afternoon.
Most of the Ministers were disposed to treat the matter
as unworthy of serious notice, with the exception of the
Duke of Wellington and Earl Bathurst, who, having
heard rumours from various quarters, of secret meetings
for some dangerous object, strongly urged the propriety of
further investigation, by placing the matter in the hands
of the Magistrates and officers of Bow Street, who at
that time were the detective, as well as executive, police
of London. Through their means a communication was
opened with the person (one Hidon) who had addressed
Lord Harrowby in the Park, and on promise of personal
safety and reward, he disclosed the whole plot, averring that
it was from scruples of conscience, that he had resolved
to give warning to the Ministers, as soon as he learned





<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>
from Thistlewood that the insurrection (to which he had
at first been a ready adherent) was to commence with a
wholesale and atrocious murder. The Cabinet, having
met to consider the fittest means of dealing with these
discoveries, and of arresting as many as possible of the
conspirators, it was proposed by the Duke of Wellington,
as the surest plan of seizing the whole gang in the very
act of outrage, that the Cabinet dinner should not be
given up, but that, during the previous night, a party of
twenty picked men of the Foot Guards, and a few of the
most active Bow Street officers, should be introduced
privately into the Earl of Harrowby's House, and concealed in the garrets; that two hundred men should be
warned for duty at Portman Street Barracks, late in the
afternoon, on some pretence not likely to cause suspicion,
and that a squadron of the 1st Life Guards then in Hyde
Park Barracks should be ordered as if for an escort of
the King to the theatre; both detachments to be in
readiness at seven o'clock. Two officers, in plain clothes,
were to ride slowly through Grosvenor Square at halfpast seven, as if returning from a ride in the Park, and
to loiter in Grosvenor Street and Audley Street, till they
perceived the approach of the conspirators. Meanwhile
the Ministers were to arrive in their carriages as usual,
each having pistols in his despatch-box, and the dinner
was to be served up. But after the second course, the
servants were to close the dining-room shutters, and the
Ministers to remove quickly, by the back stairs, up to
the drawing-room, the front stairs being previously blocked
up, at the first landing-place, with chairs and furniture,



     <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

and the twenty Foot Guards concealed in the garrets
brought down into the entrance-hall.
  </p><p>  At a quarter before eight, the hour fixed by Thistlewood for the attack of the house, these officers were
to proceed, slowly at first, but, as soon as out of sight
from Grosvenor Square, at full gallop, to summon the
two hundred men from Portman Street, and the Life
Guards from Hyde Park barracks. The Guards were to
come at double quick, and to form a cordon across the
square in front of Lord Harrowby's house, while the Life
Guards were to gallop across the Park, pass quickly along
Mount Street, and occupy it, as well as Charles Street, and
the upper part of South Audley Street, so that the whole
block of houses of which Lord Harrowby's formed a part,
should be instantly and completely surrounded, and all
escape, for those within the space enclosed, rendered impossible. Such was the Duke's scheme, and, had it been
carried out, there can be no doubt that every one of the
gang must have been killed or captured; but except Lord
Castlereagh, none of the Ministers deemed it prudent to
allow matters to go so far, considering the desperation of
the conspirators, and the risk of mistake, or delay, by the
troops. It was therefore determined, that steps should be
taken to attack and seize the gang, in their own rendezvous
in Cato Street, as late as possible before the moment of
their start for Grosvenor Square, which seizure might be
effected by a small force, and with less chance of the
secret transpiring. No warning was therefore given to the
troops, but at seven o'clock two Bow Street officers, with a
warrant and authority from the Home Secretary, arrived



<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>

at Portman Street, and called for the officer on barrack
duty for the day, and a party of forty men of the Coldstream Guards. Leaving directions for this detachment
to follow them as fast as possible, the Bow Street officers
hastened on to Cato Street, to keep a look-out, till the
soldiers should arrive. Unluckily it had not occurred to
them to provide a guide for the soldiers; and neither Mr.
F. Fitzclarence, who was the officer, nor any of the men,
had a distinct knowledge of where Cato Street lay, beyond
a general notion of its being near the Edgeware Road.
They had already missed their way, when they accidentally met a lad who had been in Mr. Fitzclarence's
stable, and who, at his desire, undertook to guide them to
the place. They arrived but just in time, for the Bow Street
officers, hearing a considerable stir in the loft, and fearing
lest some of the conspirators might escape, had rushed up
the ladder, and one of them, Smithers, was just falling,
having been stabbed to the heart by Thistlewood. Mr.
Fitzclarence and Sergeant Legge rushed up into the loft
followed by the men, and, the lights being struck out, a
desperate struggle ensued, in which Mr. Fitzclarence's
cap was cut through with a sword, close to his head, and
though the greater number of the gang were captured, yet
a dozen or more escaped and made for Edgeware Road
and the Park, among whom was their leader Thistlewood.
     </p><p>Within two hours after this, the alarm had spread
through London in a manner almost incredible. The
troops were all placed under arms in their barracks;
dinner parties, assemblies, and balls, were quickly dispersed; the wildest reports flew about in all directions;


          <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

nor was anything like tranquillity restored in London till
long after daybreak next morning; when the astonishment
of all, was great, at learning how few were the conspirators,
and how quickly and completely their sanguinary plot had
been frustrated. A strict search was now commenced
for Thistlewood, and his capture was effected a few days
afterwards, by Bishop, an active Bow Street officer, in the
garret of an obscure lodging in White Street, Finsbury,
by the treachery of one of his associates, who gave
information of his hiding-place to the Magistrates. A
man named Edwards also came forward with evidence
against his fellow conspirators, and another named Adams,
who had formerly been a soldier. A special commission
was immediately issued for the trial of the conspirators,
and their leaders were committed to the Tower, and
placed in custody of the Warders in different parts of the
fortress: Thistlewood in the Bloody Tower; Ings and
Davidson (who was a negro) in St. Thomas's Tower;
Harrison, Brunt, Tidd, Monument, and Wilson in the
Byward and Middle Towers; and Hooper in the Salt
Tower. The trials were proceeded with on the 17th of
April; and the evidence of their guilt was so plain, that
their sentences soon followed. Nor indeed did most
of them deny the facts, but assumed a tone of bravado,
and endeavoured to blame, and damage, those who had
betrayed them. The five first were ordered for execution
in front of Newgate, and the rest were transported for life.
  </p><p>   It was determined to keep up to a certain degree
 the terrors of an execution for high treason, and yet to
 mitigate the details of the ancient executions, especially



<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>

in respect to the frightful protraction of the criminals'
sufferings. On the 1st of May a scaffold was erected from
the window over the gate of Newgate, and at eight o'clock
the five men were brought out. In reply to the exhortations of the clergyman, Thistlewood said in a surly tone,
" We shall soon know the great secret ;" the rest assumed a
look of bravado, and Tidd, one of the most savage of the
gang, actually attempted to dance on his way to the scaffold;
but they were all evidently under the influence of extreme
terror, when they took their places under the gallows,
and the Executioner attached the ropes to their necks.
The fall of the drop took place at exactly eight o'clock
and in dead silence. They were left hanging till nine,
when a coffin was brought to the front of the scaffold,
and placed on tressels about two feet high. At one end
of it, was placed a block, on the same level as the upper
edge of the coffin. A man now made his appearance,
with his face covered with crape, and a broad knife in his
hand like that used by butchers, and placed himself by the
side of the block. The Executioner an his assistant then
cut down one of the corpses from the gallows, and placed
it in the coffin, but with the head hanging over on the
block. The man with the knife instantly severed the head
from the body, and the Executioner receiving it in his
hands, held it up in front, and on each side of the scaffold,
saying in a loud voice, " This is the head of a traitor."
He then dropped it into the coffin, which being removed,
another was brought forward, and they proceeded to cut
down the next body, and to go through the same ghastly
operation.

    <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

 </p><p> It was observed, that the mob, which was very large,
gazed in silence and fear at the hanging of the conspirators, and showed not the least sympathy; but when
each head was cut off, and held up, a loud and deep groan
of horror burst from all sides, which was not soon forgotten by those who heard it.
  </p><p>  The people dispersed so quietly, that it was evident
the conspiracy had found no favour among the masses,
and had been confined entirely to Thistlewood's followers.
In fact, this was so well known to the authorities, that
although all the troops in London were kept in readiness in
their barracks, 150 of the Life Guards, and the Bow Street
constables, were the only force stationed in the neighbourhood of the scaffold during the execution.
   </p><p> It will be in the recollection of several persons yet
living, that some months before the Cato Street Plot, a
strange alarm took place at a grand full-dress ball given
by the Spanish Ambassador in Portland Place, which was
attended by the Regent, the Duke of York, the Duke of
Cambridge, and the Duke of Wellington (all of whom
wore Spanish Generals' uniforms in honour of the occasion), as well as by the ministers and other distinguished
persons. At about one o'clock, just before supper, a sort
of order was circulated among the younger officers, to
draw towards the head of the stairs, though no one knew
for what reason, except that an unusual crowd had collected in the street. The appearance of Lavender, and
one or two well-known Bow Street officers, in the entrancehall, also gave rise to surmises of some impending riot.
While the officers were whispering to each other as to









<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>
what was expected to happen, a great noise was heard in
the street, the crowd dispersed with loud cries in all directions, and a squadron of the 2nd Life Guards arrived with
drawn swords at a gallop from their barracks (then situated
in King Street) and rapidly formed in front of the Ambassador's house. Lavender and the Bow Street officers now
withdrew; the officers who had gathered about the stairhead were desired to return to the ball-room. The alarm,
whatever it might have been, appeared to be over, and
before the company broke up, the Life Guards had been
withdrawn to their barracks.
   </p><p> Inside of the Ambassador's house all had remained
so quiet, that very few of the ladies present were aware
till next day, that anything unusual had happened; but
it became known after a short time, that the Duke
of Wellington had received information of an intended
attack upon the house, which the precautions taken had
probably prevented; and upon the trial of Thistlewood
and his gang, it came out, among other evidences of
the various wild schemes they had formed, that Thistlewood had certainly entertained the project, at the time
of this ball, to attack the Spanish Ambassador's house, and
destroy the Regent, and other Royal personages, as well as
the Ministers, who were sure to be most of them present
on the occasion.</p>

         <p> THE   valuable and extensive collection of
            armour in the Tower, is an object of deserved admiration and interest to visitors
            but according to the judgment of antiquaries
and persons conversant with the subject, it is beginning
to require a fresh inspection and arrangement, similar to
that made by the late Dr. Meyrick, about twenty-eight
years ago, under the direction of the Duke of Wellington,
when Constable of the Tower. In the mean time, however, it is attended to and cleaned with much care;
and, if some confusion of the detail has arisen since Dr.
Meyrick's inspection, there is no doubt it may at any
time be rectified, at little pains and expense. Still it is a
subject of reasonable regret, that in so large and fine
a collection, any moderate outlay should be spared to
classify and to arrange the armour, in a manner suitable
to a great national collection of such value and interest.
  </p><p>  It would be out of place here to introduce even
an abstract of the very long published Catalogue of
the Tower Armoury, but it may be mentioned that
among other remarkable suits of armour, there is a
very handsome one, complete both in the armament of






<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>

horse and man, which was presented by the Emperor
Maximilian to Henry VIII., after their celebrated meeting
at the siege of the town of Terouenne. The equipment
of the horse is of the finest steel, engraved in every part
with rich patterns, interspersed with representations of
the martyrdom of several saints of the Romish Church.
But the most curious is, a very elaborate delineation
of a female, undergoing the terrible torture of the rack,
and portraying every detail of the mechanism of that
frightful engine. The Rack seems to have consisted of a
strongly framed wooden trough, like a horse-trough, in
which the sufferer was extended at full length; at each
end of the trough was fitted a transverse cylinder, round
which, in the fashion of a windlass, a stout rope was
passed, after being secured to the wrists of the person
under torture. This cylinder projected beyond the side
of the trough, sufficiently to admit of the insertion of
four wooden bars, into holes pierced through its diameter
by which it could be powerfully turned, so as to tighten
the rope, and produce a strain upon the sufferer's arms,
so severe as not unfrequently to dislocate the shoulders.
  </p><p>   A similar windlass at the other end of the trough
produced a fearful strain upon the joints of the knees
and hips; so that it is hardly possible to conceive a
more universal distension and agony to the whole human
frame than this infernal engine must have caused. The
expression of the female's countenance, though a mere
outline, conveys a most painful impression, while the
deliberate coolness with which the operator at the windlass is forcing round the bars which he grasps, conveys




                   <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

a frightful idea of the indifference produced by habit
to the performance of so barbarous an office.
  </p><p>  An instance of this indifference occurred at the torture of the unfortunate Anne Askew, who was accused
of denying the real presence in the administration of
the sacrament.
   </p><p> The mock ceremony of her trial took place in Guildhall, where, after repeated exhortations to confess the error
of her belief, she was, by Henry VIII.'s own order, twice
placed on the rack. The first time, she was lifted off,
after repeatedly fainting under her sufferings. The second
time no such mercy was shown, and when Sir Anthony
Knyvett, the Lieutenant of the Tower, unable to endure
any longer the sight of the unhappy young lady's agonies,
ordered the executioner to desist from turning the wheel,
Wriothesly, the Chancellor, seized the bars, and recommenced the torture with his whole strength. On his
complaining to the King afterwards of Knyvett's leniency,
the latter only saved himself from the loss of his place,
by begging pardon on his knees, for his praiseworthy
act of humanity.

        <p>THERE are a great number of cannon of all
           kinds and periods in the Tower, a correct
           list of which will be found in the Guidebooks, and only a few of them can here
be noticed.  One of the most curious is a very long
and heavy gun, placed on the west side of the White
Tower. By the inscription upon this gun, it appears to
have been cast under the immediate auspices and direction of Solyman the Magnificent, for the express purpose
of his meditated invasion of India. It is about eighteen
feet long; and as it is evident that some portion of the
muzzle has been sawn off, it must have been originally
cast of longer dimensions than any even of the monster
guns of our time. The reason assigned by tradition for
the amputation of the extremity of this gun, was a
supposition that from its peculiar yellow colour there
was an alloy of gold in the metal, and it would
seem, from the clumsy way in which the muzzle was
cut off, that this portion had been stolen, in order
to melt it down, and extract the gold it contained
by chemical process. In his very interesting description of the military power and armament of the Turks,

<pb id="p.245" n="245"/>
Montecuculi observes, that they excelled all nations
in the art of casting large cannon, and gives some
remarkable details as to their bringing their gunmetal up the Danube, on the occasion of one of their
invasions of the Austrian dominions, and actually casting
cannon before the towns which they invested and besieged. This he tells us was done by sinking pits in the
earth, and lining them with a composition which formed
a mould for the gun. The casting of any very large
piece of ordnance was treated by the Turks as a grand
ceremony; the Sultan himself often attended, and on
such occasions the great officers and pachas present were
in the habit of casting purses of gold into the liquid metal,
as a special homage and compliment to the presence
of their sovereign. It is difficult to believe that large
sums of gold should thus have been wasted, in what at
best was an absurd piece of adulation; but the prodigality and ostentation of the Turks of that period,
when, in the insolence of their riches and military
power, they threatened to overrun the finest countries of
Europe, would account for almost any display in honour
of Solyman, whose ambition, ability, and spirit had elevated the military character of the Turks to a higher
standard of renown than it ever attained before or after
his long and glorious reign.
 </p><p>    In order to clear up the question, and ascertain the
existence or not of the supposed alloy, the Lieutenant-
Governor of the Tower applied in June, 1865, to Mr.
Graham, the Master of the Mint, who obligingly deputed
Mr. Field, an experienced officer of that department, to



<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>

make the trial, by chipping off a small piece of the muzzle,
where it had been, as before mentioned, sawn off, and
subjecting it to the scientific tests so well understood at the
Mint. After a close examination, it turned out that there
was not a particle of gold in the metal, but a large proportion of copper, which had given it the colour by which
the thieves, who sawed off the extremity, had probably
been deceived into the belief that it contained gold.

  </p><p>There are two handsome guns on the Parade which
were placed in the Tower at the end of the Seven Years'
War, having been cast at Woolwich from some cannon
captured from the French in the second expedition to
Cherbourg in 1758. It was a strange notion thus to
commemorate that affair, for, although the surprise of
Cherbourg placed the French cannon from which these
two guns were made in the hands of the English, yet
the troops, when they afterwards sailed round and landed
near St. Malo, which they found too strong to attack, behaved with such irregularity, and such gross carelessness
and bad arrangements occurred on their march to St. Cass,
that the Commander, General Bligh, surprised by a superior force hastily collected by the Duc d'Aiguillon, was in
his turn defeated with loss, and his soldiers driven into
the sea in attempting to regain their transports. General
Dury, the second in command, made a gallant endeavour
to rally a battalion of the Foot Guards, who were covering the rear, but the confusion was irretrievable, and,
being much weakened by a wound received in the conflict, he perished in trying to swim off to a boat.
   </p><p> In the Tower collection there are many fine specimens

   <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>

of ornamental casting, but that which specially
attracts notice from an admirer of art, is a superb  12-lb.
gun captured at Malta, in the upper room above the
Horse Armoury. Nothing can be more bold and masterly than the shape of the dragon which forms the
main portion of the carriage, and it is evidently from
the design of a master-hand.
  </p><p>  As a proof how few inventions have not had some
former origin in one form or another, there is preserved,
in the upper chamber of the Horse Armoury, a revolver,
which dates from the reign of James I. It is of course
a clumsy affair, but the principle is exactly similar to
Colonel Colt's celebrated invention.
  </p><p>  The banqueting-hall and council-chamber of the
White Tower have been admirably fitted up (and without
any sacrifice of their original architectural features) as
armouries for the conservation of the store of rifles for
the direct regimental supply of the army; nor is it
by any means a mere display, for every musket (and
there are 60,000) is in the best of order, and fit
for immediate use. For practical purposes this is in
every respect a far better arrangement than the old
plan of keeping the arms in chests, for whatever care
might be bestowed on the packing, it was hardly possible to make sure of the exclusion of damp; and it is
needless to observe on the mischief which arises with
so delicate a machine as the present musket, from the
smallest effects of rust on the highly finished steel-work
of the lock.</p>

</list>

        <p>THE office of Constable of the Tower dates
           from the Conquest.  One of the first on
           record was Geoffrey de Mandeville, a famous
           warrior, who came over with William the
Conqueror and received from him large possessions in
various parts of England.
   </p><p> His grandson, created Earl of Essex by King
Stephen, and appointed by him to the government of the
Tower, was confirmed in that post by the Empress
Maud.
   </p><p> The office of Constable was not confined to military
persons in the earlier reigns. Longchamp, Bishop of
Ely, was Constable in Richard I.'s time, and was succeeded by                     , Archbishop of Rouen.
In the reign of John, we find Langton, Archbishop
of Canterbury, holding this office. In Henry I.'s time,
Pandulph, Bishop of Norwich, and William, Archbishop of York, appear in the list of Constables, and also
Walter, another Archbishop of York. In Edward II.'s
reign, Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, became Constable,
but he appears to have been the last clerical dignitary
to whose custody the Tower was confided.</p>

      <pb id="p.249" n="249"/>

  <p>  To notice a few of the most celebrated and remarkable on the List of Constables. Mandeville, Earl of Essex,
who was Governor of the Tower in Henry II.'s reign, surrendered his office to the King, and deliberately adopted
the life of an outlaw, robbing abbeys, and committing
dreadful outrages in all directions, till, encouraged by
success in his restless career, he laid siege to a Royal
Castle at Burwell, in Cambridgeshire. While making a
reconnaissance of this fortress, the heat of the weather
induced him to take off his helmet, when an archer from
the battlements sent an arrow through his head, and killed
him on the spot. As Mandeville had been excommunicated by the Pope, none of his followers dared to bury
him; but the Knights Templars of London, from regard
to his rank, and some services he had rendered to their
Order, brought his corpse to the Temple, clothed in
the habit of a Templar, and, placing it in a leaden coffin,
slung it up with ropes, to some trees in their garden,
till an opportunity occurred for interring it privately,
in front of the west door of their Church.
  </p><p>  Hubert de Burgh, whose long and eminent services
to his country should have secured for him the support of
his Sovereign Henry II. against the malice of his enemies,
was forced to seek sanctuary in the Priory of Merton,
upon a false accusation of treason made against him by
the Bishop of Winchester.  But the King, in his fury,
sent an armed force to drag him from the Altar, causing
him to be brought to London, with his legs tied, like
a malefactor, under his horse's belly, and threw him
into a dungeon. This outrage of the right of sanctuary


<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>

having produced a threat of excommunication from the
clergy, Henry sent De Burgh back to Merton, with orders
to the Prior to restrict his daily food to one loaf and
a cup of ale, to allow no one to speak to him, and
especially to deprive him of a Psalter, which he had
always carried about him. As the unhappy prisoner still
adhered to his sacred refuge, this scanty supply of food
was soon after withdrawn, and he was forced by hunger
to come forth and submit. Henry caused him to be
loaded with irons and confined in a vault of the Castle of
Devizes for several months; but, whether from a late
conviction of his own injustice, or from deference to
the favour of De Burgh with the barons, he at last
released and restored him to the full possession of his
titles and honours, which he enjoyed till his decease
in 1243.
  </p><p>   Hugh le Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, Earl Mareshal of
 England, and Constable of the Tower in Henry III.'s
 reign, was one of those turbulent nobles who held the
 royal authority of such small account, that on the
 King's desiring him to lead a body of troops on a foreign
 expedition he flatly refused. " Fore G-, Sir Earl," said
 the King, "you shall go, or hang !"  "Fore G-," replied the sturdy Earl, "I will neither go nor hang !" nor
 did the monarch venture to urge him further.
  </p><p>    Bishop Stapleton, who was Constable in Edward
 II.'s reign, paid dearly for his misconduct in the
 exercise of his high office. As Constable of the only
 fortress of London, he had many opportunities for
 oppression and exaction.  Besides the fines and fees



<pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

paid by State prisoners, 20L. for a duke, 10L. for a baron,
5L. for a knight, as a sort of bargain for relieving them
from fetters, the Constable exacted all kinds of fees and
tolls, of wines, and "any dainties " brought to London
in foreign merchant ships.  Even swans which were
drifted through London Bridge by the strength of the
ebb-tide; bullocks, pigs, and sheep, which by any accident fell into the river and swam towards the Tower,
were the Constable's perquisites.  A cart rolling into
Tower-ditch, the fines accruing from  "outreys and
affrays" in the neighbourhood, a portion of every boatload of oysters, muscles, and cockles, were all subject to
the grasping claw of the Constable. Bishop Stapleton
appears to have been well aware of all his rights, and to
have applied the screw so unsparingly, that at length the
citizens were roused to insurrection, and, rising in a
body, plundered the Bishop's residence in the City, and
soon afterwards, meeting him as he was returning past St.
Paul's on horseback, dragged him from his saddle and
carried him to Cheapside, where, after going through the
form of proclaiming him an "open traitor, a seducer of
the King, and a destroyer of their liberties, they cut off his
head, and set it on a pole upon London Bridge." Nor
does it appear that any retribution was exacted by the
King for this murder and outbreak, so general was the
indignation against the Bishop.
    </p><p> De la Beche, who was Constable in Edward III.'s
time, was in so much favour with the King, that he confided the royal children to his charge, while he was absent
a the wars in France. De la Beche proved unworthy of



<pb id="p.252" n="252"/>

this confidence, and absented himself from his post, during
which his subordinates, taking example from their chief,
neglected their attendance on the royal children, leaving
them almost without proper food and clothing. Edward,
whom De la Beche supposed to be fully engaged with his
military operations in France, returned unexpectedly to
England to obtain supplies, and sailing up the Thames,
accompanied by his Queen, made his appearance at the
gate of the Tower, and called for the Governor. To his
indignation he found him absent, and the fortress guarded
by a few only of the warders, while De la Beche and his
officers were nowhere to be heard of. The alarm of the
King's arrival soon brought them however to their posts,
when they were immediately deprived of their offices, and
committed to the prisons of the fortress they had so
negligently guarded. It was soon after this, that Queen
Philippa was delivered in the Tower of a daughter,
Blanche, who died in infancy.
    </p><p> The King, returning to the prosecution of his wars in
 France, soon afterwards filled the Tower with prisoners
 of distinction from that country, including John de
 Vienne, the brave defender of Calais. Charles of Blois
 was added to the list of captives; and John, King
 of France, with his son Philip, captured at Poictiers in
 1358, after being imprisoned at the Savoy and at Windsor,
 were eventually transferred, for safer custody, to the
 Tower, and detained close prisoners till the peace of
 Bretigni, which was concluded two years afterwards.
   </p><p>  To go through the whole succession of Constables
 would not be of sufficient interest, but in Richard II.'s



     <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>

reign, the fate of Sir Thomas Rempston may be mentioned as connected with a curious privilege of the Tower
Governors. Sir Thomas had been in his barge to the
court at Westminster, to solicit a reprieve for a State
prisoner under sentence of death, and was unfortunately
overset and drowned in shooting old London Bridge on
his return to the Tower.
   </p><p> The privilege peculiar to the office of Constable, of
which Sir Thomas had on this occasion availed himself,
was that of access to the Sovereign at any hour of day or
night. Of this privilege the latest instance on record
is that of Sir William Balfour, in Charles I.'s reign,
who, at the entreaty of Lord Loudon, one of the Scotch
Covenant Commissioners discovered in a treasonable
correspondence with the King of France, and lying
prisoner in the Tower, proceeded late at night to
Whitehall, accompanied by the Marquis of Hamilton,
to seek an interview with the King, and make a last
intercession for Lord Loudon's life, carrying with him
the warrant for his execution, which had that evening
reached his hands at the Tower.
   </p><p>  Sir William, having gained admission to the Royal
presence as Lieutenant of the Tower, though the King had
retired to bed, fell on his knees, and urgently represented
the uproar that would arise in Scotland if one of their
Commissioners should be put to death, in spite of the
protection with which his mission vested him. The King
at first refused to hear these arguments, declaring that
Loudon was a traitor, and the warrant must have its course.
But the Marquis now came forward, having obtained



<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>
admission along with Balfour, and added his entreaties
for a reprieve. The King, however, still refused. "Well
then," said the Marquis, "if your Majesty be so determined, I will ride post for Scotland to-morrow morning,
for before night, the whole city will be in an uproar, and
they'll come and pull your Majesty out of your palace.
I'll get as far as I can, and declare to my countrymen
that I had no hand in it." Struck by the resolution of
the Marquis, the King hesitated, tore the warrant, and
sent back Balfour with the reprieve, which was followed
a few days later by an order for Lord Loudon's release.
It must be here observed that, although this story has
been received as History, there is a glaring improbability
in the fact of Lord Loudon having been sentenced
without trial, and the probable solution is, that Hamilton
and Balfour made their way to the King's presence, not
to plead for Lord Loudon's life, but to entreat the King
not to bring him to trial; which view is confirmed by the
fact of his being so soon afterwards released.
  </p><p>   Among the first disputes between Charles I. and
his Parliament, the custody of the Tower was a sorely
contested point, and the greatest jealousy was shown concerning it by the Commons. Not content with having
driven the King, by their remonstrances, to displace
Lunsford, whom he had appointed Governor of the Tower,
they never ceased to press him, till he had also removed
Sir John Biron, a man of character and loyalty, and
replaced him by Sir J. Conyers, in whom alone they
declared they could place confidence for so important
a trust.  In 1647 the Parliament appointed Fairfax

        <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>

Governor of the Tower. At the Restoration, Sir J. Robinson succeeded, and after him some others of less note.
Lord Dartmouth was Constable for some years. On the
abdication of James II., Lord Lucas was appointed by
the Lords Commissioners, and confirmed by William III.
 </p><p>   In George II.'s time, Charles, third Duke of Bolton,
was for a short time Constable. This nobleman is mentioned by Sir C. Hanbury Williams in one of his political
satires, with his usual bitterness towards his political
adversaries :
        <quote rend="blockquote">  "Now Bolton comes with beat of drum,
              <lb/>Though fighting be his loathing,
            <lb/>He much dislikes both pike and gun,
              <lb/>But relishes the clothing."</quote>

  </p><p>  Lord Cornwallis was appointed. Constable of the
Tower in 1770, and upon his resignation of this office in
1783, Lord George Lennox, brother of the third Duke
of Richmond, and a general officer at the time, was
nominated by George III. to succeed the Duke.
  </p><p>  Upon his appointment a question was raised in the
House of Commons, by Lord Maitland, "whether the
acceptance of the office of Constable did not render it
incumbent upon Lord George Lennox to vacate his seat
for Sussex, for which county he was one of the members ?
Several speakers on the Opposition side of the House
supported Lord Maitland, who moved for the reading of
Lord Cornwallis's warrant; and, as it appeared by the
wording of that document, that the Constable drew his
pay from the " Exchequer," Lord Maitland and his supporters argued, that it must be regarded as a "Civil












<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>
Office" under Government, which would necessitate the
vacating of his seat, by any member of that House who
should receive the appointment.
  </p><p>  But here Mr. Steele, who was Secretary to the
Treasury, interposed, and declared to the House, that,
strange as it might seem, the wording of Lord Cornwallis's
warrant was altogether wrong, and that all the warrants of
his predecessors for the last eighty years had been drawn
under the same error; for the Constable's salary was not
payable from the Exchequer at all, but had been, for the
whole of the above period, invariably included in the vote
for garrisons. Mr. Pitt then rose, and in a few pithy
sentences, showed the manifest inconvenience and absurdity of requiring Lord G. Lennox to resign his seat,
since the appointment was plainly military (though derived
straight from the Crown, and not through the Commander-in-Chief); for, said he, " if such a precedent were
once established, you might have a regimental Captain
called upon to vacate his seat, preparatory to his promotion to a Majority.  From this debate, and from an
examination of the List of Constables, it would appear
however, that Mr. Pitt was not quite correct in arguing that
the appointment was exclusively military, because certainly neither Lord Carlisle, Lord Lincoln, Lord Northampton, nor Lord Leicester, all of whom had been
Constables within the eighty years quoted by Mr. Steele,
were military men. The fact of drawing their salaries
from the military purse of the country, could no more
convert them  into military men, than it makes the
Chaplains of the army regimental officers. The effect,

     <pb id="p.257" n="257"/>

<figure id="Fig.062" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.025.DO01.00062"><head>AXE CARRIED BEFORE PEERS GOING TO TRIAL AT WESTMINSTER.</head></figure>
however, of this parliamentary discussion has
undoubtedly been, to restrict the office of
Constable to military officers, from that time
to the present; and the authority delegated by
the Sovereign to the Constable, in respect to
all persons within the walls of the Tower,
including the battalion of Guards or Line,
and the detachment of artillery which form
its regular garrison, appears on all accounts
to render it advisable, and necessary, that
the Constable of the Tower should hold a
high military rank.
   </p><p>  The Duke of Wellington, who was Constable from <dateRange from="1824" to="1852">1824 to 1852</dateRange>, regarded the office
of the Constable to be by no means a mere
honorary position, and set himself seriously
to reform and correct many abuses, which
the neglect of his predecessors had permitted
to accumulate at the Tower. One of the
most notorious of these abuses was the mode
of selecting and appointing the Warders.
These places of trust used formerly to be
sold, as vacancies occurred, for 3ooL. each,
which sum was paid by the purchaser to the
Constable. Therefore the more death vacancies occurred in the year, the more purchase-money the Constable received, and young

and able-bodied men were rarely allowed to become purchasers.
were in consequence unfitted by age and






<pb id="p.258" n="258"/>

infirmity for the charge of prisoners, the custody of the
Tower, and going round the armouries with visitors,
from whom they were in the custom of demanding fees
amounting often to 5s. or 6s. a head.
  </p><p>  The Duke at once stopped the purchase of Warderships, at a loss to himself of from 900L to 1200L. a year,
and presented these appointments to the Household
Cavalry, Foot Guards, and Regiments of the Line, as
rewards for non-commissioned officers of merit and good
service, to be recommended direct from those regiments,
without intervention of private influence.
   </p><p>  He also established the present low price of tickets
to view the Tower (6d. a head), and granting a liberal
allowance of 5s. 6d. to each Warder on such days as
it is his turn to conduct visitors, entirely stopped the
vexatious system of fees. So greatly has the abolition
of fees increased the number of visitors, that for several
years they have averaged 1000 persons a week, and
since the new armouries and Norman Chapel in the
White Tower have been restored and added to the exhibition, this number has considerably increased, producing  1200L. or 1300L. a year, which is paid into the
Exchequer by the Store Department of the War Office.
    </p><p>  On the decease of the Duke of Wellington, Lord
 Combermere, one of his oldest and most distinguished
 followers, whose discretion and judgment, when commanding the cavalry of the army in the Peninsula, had
 obtained the highest approval and confidence of the
 I)uke, was named by the Queen to succeed him as
 Constable. The pay of the post of Constable was continued
 <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>

to Lord Combermere, but on his death, in 1865,
the place was conferred on another very eminent officer
of the Duke's school, Sir John Burgoyne, without any
salary, in pursuance of a new and not very considerate
arrangement, because the Constable's duty, though not
onerous to a man of business habits, yet imposes on
him a large amount of correspondence and trouble, both
as regards the Tower itself, and the duties of Lord
Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets, entailing many little
incidental expenses which custom had rendered almost
unavoidable for the person holding this distinguished
appointment.

         <p>THE ceremony which accompanies the closing
           of the Tower Gates is of very ancient origin,
           and had reference to the safety of the Royal
           Palace, as well as to the security of State
prisoners. A few minutes before midnight the Yeoman
Porter attends at the Main Guard, and applies for the
" escort for the keys." This consists of a party of six
privates commanded by a sergeant, who accompany the
porter to the outer gate, and assist him to close it. Having
locked both the gate and wicket, the Yeoman Porter
returns bearing the keys, and followed by the escort. As
he passes the sentries, on his way back to the Main
Guard, each of them challenges, and in reply to " Who
goes there?" is answered " The keys."   The sentry
rejoins " What keys ?" to which the reply is given " The
Queen's keys," and the escort passes on, till it arrives
at the Main Guard, which now turns out, and after the
same questions and answers as to the " keys " and what
keys they are ? the officer opens the ranks, and presents
arms to " The Queen's keys," which are then carried
by the Yeoman Porter to the Governor's House, and
placed in his Office. All this ceremony and precaution

        <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>

may seem superfluous, but it is a remarkable fact, and
not the less so from the late Duke of Wellington having
caused much inquiry to be made on the subject, at the
Home Office, and elsewhere, that there has never been
any riot or serious disturbance in London, without some
plan being laid by the ringleaders, for the attack and
seizure of the Tower, from the days of Jack Cade to the
Chartist Riots in 1848.</p><p>

    </p><p>In Lord George Gordon's Riots, in 1780, a scheme
of this kind was in contemplation by the mob.  Lord
George himself solemnly declared it was without his
connivance, and very possibly that may have been true



<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>
but this is the common apology of those who place themselves at the head of riots, and it ought never to be
received as any extenuation of their guilt and responsibility. The seizure of the Tower was also a chief feature
in the wild and desperate conspiracy for which Colonel
Despard and several of his followers were hanged in 1803.
He had seduced from their allegiance, by plausible falsehoods and delusions, some unfortunate soldiers of the
Foot Guards, who, having been in garrison at the Tower,
were well acquainted with its localities, of which knowledge
he proposed to take advantage, for more readily surprising
the gates. Despard's object was not only to seize the large
stores of arms and ammunition usually kept in the Tower,
but he held out to his followers the chance of obtaining
the valuable plunder of the Crown Jewels, and other
precious deposits within the Tower walls. On the occasion of Sir Francis Burdett's Riots in 1816-17, plans were
proposed for exciting and organising the mob to make an
attack on the Tower, by some of his followers, though Sir
Francis himself disclaimed, of course, any participation
in them, nor was he at all the man to enter into any such
absurd and desperate measure.
 </p><p>    Discoveries of plans for seizure of the Tower were
made on occasion of both Watson's and Thistlewood's
conspiracies; also at the Riots in 1831, and the more
serious demonstrations of the Chartists in 1848. It was
from consideration of these facts, that the late Duke of
Wellington, during the many years he held the office
of Constable of the Tower, was extremely particular in
maintaining the old rules, and very strict about all the


           <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>

precautions for closing the gates at night, and refusing
admission during the day to persons, who presented
themselves, without ostensible business.  It was by the
Duke's desire, that a force of twelve constables from the
Metropolitan Police was specially appointed to the Tower
for prevention of pilfering in the public Stores, and also for
security against the danger of fire. The number of old and
dilapidated buildings within the Tower, and the numerous
warehouses in the neighbourhood, require much vigilance
in respect to fires, and although no serious accident has
occurred since the great fire of the storehouses in 1841,
yet in spite of all the watchfulness of police and sentries,
it is a remarkable fact that no year passes without two or
three alarms of fire in the Tower.  The danger it is true
has been quickly arrested by the immediate aid of the
troops in garrison, and the excellent organisation of the
Artillery in working and manning the four fire engines,
but the cautions are very necessary and should never be
relaxed.
   </p><p> It appears from the following account of a foreigner's
visit to the Tower about 16o years ago, that at that
time the precaution was taken of requiring visitors to
leave their swords at the gate. The description of the
royal furniture and stores in the Tower is so peculiar,
that no apology is necessary for its introduction.
</p><p>
          <quote rend="blockquote">  Extract from Knight's 'London.'
    "Paul Hentzner's account of his visit to the Tower
in Queen Anne's time.-Upon entering the Tower of
London, we were obliged to leave our swords at the gate,





<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>
and deliver them to the guard. When we were intro
duced, we were shown above a hundred pieces of arras
belonging to the Crown, made of gold, silver, and silk;
several saddles covered with velvet of different colours;
an immense quantity of bed-furniture, such as canopies
and the like, some of them richly ornamented with pearl;
some royal dresses, so extremely magnificent as to raise
any one's admiration at the sums they must have cost.
We were next led to the Armoury, in which are these
particularities :-spears out of which you may shoot;
shields that will give fire four times; a great many rich
halberds, commonly called partisans, with which the
guard defend the royal person in battle; some lances
covered with red and green velvet, and the suit of armour
of King Henry VIII.; many and very beautiful arms, as
well for men as for horse-fights; the lance of Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, three spans thick; two pieces
of cannon-the one fires three, the other seven balls at a
time; two others made of wood, which the English had
at the siege of Boulogne in France, and by this stratagem,
without which they could not have succeeded, they struck
a terror as at the appearance of Artillery, and the town
was surrendered upon articles; nineteen cannons of a
thicker make than ordinary, and in a room apart thirty-
six of a smaller; other cannons for chain-shot, and balls
proper to bring down masts of ships; cross-bows, bows
and arrows, of which to this day the English make use in
their exercises. But who can relate all that is to be seen
here?  Eight or nine men employed by the year are
scarce sufficient to keep all the arms bright.

    The mint for coining money is in the Tower.
N.B. It is to be noted that, when any of the nobility are
sent hither, on the charge of high crimes punishable
with death, such as murder, &amp;c., they seldom or never
recover their liberty. Here was beheaded Anna Bolen,
wife of King Henry VIII., and lies buried in the chapel
but without any inscription; and Queen Elizabeth was
kept prisoner here by her sister, Queen Mary, at whose
death she was enlarged, and by right called to the
throne.
    " On coming out of the Tower we were led to a
small house close by, where are kept variety of creatures,
viz., three lionesses, one lion of great size called Edward
VI., from his having been born in that reign; a tiger, a
lynx, a wolf exceedingly old; this is a very scarce animal
in England, so that their sheep and cattle stray about in
great numbers without any danger, though without anybody to keep them; there is, besides, a porcupine and an
eagle: all these creatures are kept in a remote place,
fitted up for the purpose with wooden lattices, at the
Queen's expense.
    " Near to this Tower is a large open space: on the
highest part of it (Tower Hill) is erected a wooden
scaffold for the execution of noble criminals; upon which
they say three princes of England, the last of their
families, have been beheaded for high treason. On the
Thames close by are a great many cannon, such chiefly
as are used at sea."

       <p>  FROM the earliest times it appears to have
           been the custom of our kings to collect and
           keep in the Tower wild beasts of various
           descriptions, as a sort of appendage to the
Palace.  The first we hear of this in our Historical
Records, was the sending of three leopards to be kept in
the Tower, by Henry III., these animals having been
presented to him by the Emperor Frederick, in reference
to the royal armorial bearings of England. Soon after,
the same King placed a white bear in the Tower, with a
pension of 4d. a day for his keep, and orders to provide
him with a chain and a muzzle for his security, and also
" Unam longam et fortem cordam, ad tenendum eum
ursum, piscantem in aqua Tamisi&amp;aelif;,"-" a long and strong
cord to hold this bear when fishing in the water of
Thames."
   </p><p> In 1255 the King of France sent Henry III. a
present of an elephant, " a beast most strange and wonderfull to the English people, sith most seldom or never
any of that kind had been seene in Englond before that
tyme." A house or shed was built for him in the Tower,
and he and his keeper received a regular allowance from

     <pb id="p.267" n="267"/>

the City of London, on which corporation, by the bye,
this King was in the habit of throwing any little extra
expense which he did not exactly know how to provide
from his own resources.
  </p><p>  During the reigns of the three Edwards, the collection
of wild beasts in the Tower was from time to time greatly
increased. A lion, belonging to Edward II., had a quarter
of mutton allowed daily for his dinner, and his keeper was
allowed 1&amp;frac1/2.d a day for his own board; but, by a later
order of this King, 9l. 7s. 6d. annually was allowed for
the support of the whole of the wild beasts in the Tower.
Keepers were now becoming of more necessity and consequence, and in Henry VI.'s reign we find one Robert
Mansfield placed over the establishment, with a good
salary attached to his office. In Richard III.'s short
reign, the office of keeper of the wild beasts was not
beneath the acceptance of Brackenbury the Lieutenant of
the Tower; and when Henry VII. made Tiptoft, Earl
of Oxford, Constable of the Tower, he also conferred on
him the distinct charge of Keeper of the lions.
  </p><p>  It was reserved for James I. to subject these noble
creatures to wanton cruelty for the sport of baiting them.
He caused three fierce mastiffs to be brought to the
Tower, where the King and Queen, with the Prince, and
four or five courtiers, placed themselves in the windows
of the Lions' Tower to view the savage amusement.
  </p><p>  The following is the circumstantial account of an eyewitness:-" The King, Queene, and Prince, with four or
five Lords, went to the Lions' Toure, and caused the
lustiest lion to be separated from his mate, and put into



<pb id="p.268" n="268"/>

the lion's den one dog alone, who presently flew to the
face of the lion; but the lion suddenly shooke him off,
and graspt him fast by the neck, drawing the dog up
staires and downe staires. The King, now perceiving
the lion greatly exceede the dog in strength, but nothing
in noble heart and courage, caused another dog to be
put into the denne, who prooved as hot and lusty as his
fellow, and tooke the lion by the face; but the lion began
to deale with him as with the former; whereupon the King
commanded the third dog to be put in, before the second
dog was spoiled, which third dog, more fierce and fell
than eyther of the former, and in despite eyther of clawes
or strength, tooke the lion by the lip; but the lion so
tore the dog by the eyes, head, and face, that he lost his
hold, and then the lion tooke the dog's necke in his
mouth, drawing him up and downe as he did the former,
but, being wearied, could not bite so deadly as at the
first.  Now, whilest the last dog was thus hand to hand
with the lion in the upper roome, the other two dogs
were fighting together in the lower roome, whereupon the
King caused the lion to be driven downe, thinking the
lion would have parted them; but when he saw he must
needs come by them, he leaped cleane over them both,
and, contrary to the King's expectation, the lion fled into
an inward den, and would not by any meanes endure the
presence of the dogs; albeit the last dog pursued eagerly,
but could not finde the way to the lyon.  You shall
understand the two last dogs, whilest the lion held them
both under his pawes, did bite the lion by the belly,
whereat the lion roared so extreamely that the earth

       <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>

shooke withall, and the next lion rampt and roared as if
he would have made rescue." The two dogs which had
been first engaged in this combat died within a few days,
but the third recovered.
  </p><p>  The same writer gives the following particulars respecting the menagerie, and of a second visit made by
King James to the lions' den, in June, 1605.  " In the
spring of this yeare the Kinge builded a wall, and filled
up with earth all that part of the mote or ditch about the
west sid of the lions' den, and appoynted a drawing partition to be made towards the south part thereof, the one
part thereof to serve for the breeding lionesse when she
shall have whelps, and the other part thereof for a walke
for other lions. The Kinge caused also three trap doores
to bee made in the wall of the lyon's den, for the lyons to
goe into their walke at the pleasure of the keeper, which
walke shall bee maintayned and kept for especiall place
to baight the lyons with dogges, beares, bulles,bores, &amp;c.
Munday, June 3, in the afternoone, his Majestie, beeing
accompanied with the Duke of Lenox, the Earles of
Worcester, Pembroke, Southampton, Suffolke, Devonshire,
Salisbury, and Mountgomery, and Lord Heskin, Captayne
of his Highnesse Guarde, with many knights and gentlemen of name, came to the Lyons' Tower, and, for that
time, was placed over the platforme of the lyons, because,
as yet, the galleries were not builded, the one of them for
the King and great Lords, and the other for speciall personages. The King, being placed as aforesayde, commaunded Master Raph Gyll, Keeper of the Lyons, that
his servants should put forth into the walke the male and


<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>
female breeders, but the lyons woulde not goe out by
any ordinary meanes that could be used, neither would
they come neere the trap doore, untill they were forced
out with burning linkes, and, when they were come downe
into the walke, they were both amazed, and stood looking
about them, and gazing up into the ayre; then was there
two rackes of mutton throwne unto them, which they did
presently eate ; then was there a lusty live cocke cast unto
them, which they presently killed and sucked his bloud;
then was there another live cocke cast unto them, which
they likewise killed, but sucked not his blood.  After
that the Kinge caused a live lambe to be easily let downe
unto them by a rope, and, being come to the grounde,
the lambe lay upon his knees, and both the lyons stoode
in their former places, and only beheld the lamb, but
presently the lambe rose up and went unto the lyons,
who very gently looked uppon him and smelled on him
without signe of any further hurt; then the lambe was
very softly drawne up againe in as good plight as hee was
let downe. Then they caused those lyons to be put into
their denne, and another male lyon only to be put forth,
and two lusty mastiffes, at a by doore to be let in to him,
and they flew fiercely uppon him, and, perceiving the
lyon's necke to be so defended with hayre they could not
hurt him, sought onely to bite him by the face, and did
so; then was there a third dogge let in, as fierce as the
fiercest. One of them, a brended dogge, tooke the lyon
by the face, and turned him uppon his backe; but the
lyon spoyled them all; the best dogge died the next day."
   </p><p> Another combat was exhibited on the 23rd June, 1609,


           <pb id="p.271" n="271"/>

when King James, and all his family, with divers noblemen and many others, assembled in the Tower " to see a
trial of the lyon's single valour, against a great fierce
beare, who had killed a child that was negligently left in
the beare-house;" yet neither ' the great lyon," which
was first " put forth," nor " divers other lyons," nor " the
two young lustie lions, which were bred in that yard, and
were now grown great," could be induced to fight, but all
" sought the next way into their dennes, as soone as they
espied the trap-doores open." A stone-horse, however,
which had been turned into the same yard, would have
been worried to death by six dogs, had not the King
commanded the bear-wards to rescue him. About a
fortnight afterwards, the bear was baited to death upon
a stage, by the King's order; "and unto the mother of
the murthered child was given twenty pounds, out of the
money which the people gave to see the bear kil'd."
   </p><p> It is not easy to imagine a more disgusting display,
or a greater mockery of justice and charity, than this
niggardly device of the King's for saving his own pocket,
by the contributions of a collection of spectators of tastes
as brutal as his own.
  </p><p>  In 1758 George II. had so bad a fit of gout,
being then seventy-five, that Lord Chesterfield wrote,
-"It was generally thought that H. M. would have
died, and for a very good reason, for the oldest lion in
the Tower-much about the King's age-died a fortnight ago! This extravagancy, I can assure you, was
believed by many above the common people." *<note place="foot" n="1">From Lord Stanhope's History of England.

difficult is it for human imagination to assign any bounds,
however remote, to human credulity.
   </p><p> The Tower menagerie was so much in the way of
the restorations of the entrance towers and gates, and
appeared such an unnecessary appendage to the Royal
Palace and Fortress, that in the year 1831 the Duke
of Wellington obtained the King's leave to remove it
altogether, and to clear away the unsightly dens and
sheds with which the entrance was encumbered and
disfigured.</p>

 <p>"Though it is probable, that there were occasionally Sub-Constables
or Lieutenants placed in charge of the Tower at a much earlier period,
the first we find particularly named, as filling that office, was Giles
de Oudenard, who held it in the beginning of the reign of King Edward
I., under Anthony of Bek, afterwards Bishop of Durham, the then
Constable. In the next reign Ralph Bavant is noticed as the Lieutenant
of John de Crumwell; and after this period our records frequently make
mention of Lieutenants."</p>
