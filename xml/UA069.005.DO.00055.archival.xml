     OLD LONDON       BRIDGE, exactly three hundred      and   sixteen years ago on May-day, exhibited a scene of excitement, which
had perchance scarcely ever been surpassed, since David de Lindsaye,
Earl of Crawford, a Scottish Knight, in <date value="1390">1390</date>, overthrew the Lord John
de Welles of England, in a joust, upon this selfsame Bridge of London.
They  had met to uphold the honour of their respective countries, and
so chivalrously did the noble David bear himself upon that proud day
for Scotland, that when, upon the third encounter, the Lord de Welles
lay prostrate before his valorous foe, instead of vantage taking and
       striking his dagger into the throat of the vanquished lord, he threw
           himself in kind embrace upon the neck of the wounded knight, exclaiming- Live, Sir Knight! I fought without anger, and but for
      glory of my native land."</p><p>
      Ere we proceed into the deep mazes of our truthful tale, it were as
      well since OLD LONDON BRIDGE is to become the very heart of our
          romance just to give the gentle reader some idea of its appearance
          about middle of the sixteenth century, as it then stood, the " Pride
          of our Proud City, and Wonder of the World."
       </p><p>This high-sounding title was, at the time we speak of, richly
         deserved,  and was not infrequently used in olden times, particularly by
         foreigners, who, having visited our metropolis to barter their Milan
    steel for      our strong English bows, or bring our Kings some young and
          beauteous princess as a bride, would write (the few who could write)
          to their friends in the most distant quarters of the then known globe,
   extolling as " this world's wonder," our famous London Bridge.
       </p><p>     Old London    Bridge, our Old London Bridge, was begun as long ago








<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>

as <date value="1176">1176</date>, and after thirty-three years of labour, was finished in <date value="1209">1209</date>.</p><p>
Peter of Colechurch, the Priest-architect, who built it, although often
blamed in our day for his lack of engineering knowledge, must have
laid his foundations pretty sure, for the arches he then raised were the
same that, not twenty years ago, were pulled down upon the completion
of the present structure, having lasted no less than 622 years, in spite
of the ceaseless torrent of the mighty Thames.
  </p><p>There were originally twenty arches, or rather spaces, between the
piers, for one was covered, not by an arch, but by a drawbridge, to
allow of ships passing to the more western part of the city.
  </p><p>Upon the upper platform, or roadway, which was forty feet wide,
there stood two towers, one on either side of the eighteenth arch, close
to the Southwark end; and in the centre of the bridge a beautiful
chapel was erected, which chapel was dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket,
and thence called-- St. Thomas of the Bridge."
  </p><p>Now, as the English, who, ever since they have borne that name,
have been-and Heaven grant they may long remain so, for it speaks
of industry, peace, and wealth-a " nation of shopkeepers,"    soon
discovered that such a thoroughfare as the bridge must inevitably
become, might easily be transformed into a mine of wealth, so, almost
immediately upon   its completion, did they begin to build   shops
thereon.
  </p><p>These shops, or rather sheds-for at first they were but little more-
day by day increased in value, then in numbers, and ere long took the
more dignified form and name of houses, for the traders then, unlike
those of the present day, knew full well, that</p>
                       <quote rend="blockquote"><l>The bee who will thrive,
                       </l><l>Lives in his hive.</l></quote>
<p>  It was not thought impossible, by these right worthy progenitors of
our present greatness, but that, a haberdasher, a glover, a lantern-
maker, or a chandler, could exist, and be respected too, without having
a country house at Brixton, or spending twice as much as his business
brought in, just to uphold his bankrupt show of unsubstantial respectability.  These sheds, therefore, soon had the addition of a sleeping-
room behind them; and, in consequence of the narrowness of the
bridge, which, as we have said, was only forty feet wide, these extra
rooms were made to overhang the sides of the bridge, in many instances
to an awful and truly dangerous extent.
</p><p>  The traffic of the bridge, and consequently the trade, increasing
rapidly, more commodious buildings arose; many of them  reaching to
four and even five stories in height.  To hold together the two sides of
the BRIDGE STREET, for such it had now become, and such it was now
called, many of the grander buildings extended entirely across, thus
binding together, and keeping the overhanging dwellings from falling
outwards into the river.
</p><p>  Beneath these last-noticed stupendous structures was a wide and lofty
archway, under which the main road passed.  This road was twenty feet
wide in most parts, but in others it was reduced to the very narrow limits
of four yards.






                               <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>

</p><p> When the reader recalls to mind the style of architecture so greatly
admired in those days, and pictures to himself the houses with every
story projecting some feet beyond the one beneath, he will easily conceive the proximity of the upper windows on the two sides of this narrow
way; indeed, in some cases they almost touched, rendering the street
beneath dark, dingy, close, and unwholesome. To obviate, as far as
possible, this drawback to health and comfort, three wide openings were
left unbuilt upon, from which a splendid view might be obtained both
up and down the river; these openings acted, also, as safeguards to foot
passengers, who could here find protection when the road was inconveniently thronged with carts and carriages. The greatest of these three
openings was that of the drawbridge, and was fifty feet wide, forming
an admirable standing place upon days of aquatic pageants for those
merry-making citizens who ever loved to see such sights, but who lacked
the advantage of being acquainted with the wealthy traders of the
bridge, and thus be enabled to get a peep at the show more commodiously
from the windows of the houses.
</p><p>  Another method of tying, as it were, the opposite sides of the street
together, was by enormous wooden beams extending from roof to roof,
and also by transverse narrow bridges; from most of these swung ever-
creaking signs of most fanciful device. Here floated in the breeze " The
Lock of Hair,"-there " The Three Bibles ;"-here the tempting " Sugar
Loaf," and there " The Lamb and Breeches."  But as we shall, in all
probability, have to converse with some of the owners of these pictorial
show-cards, we will for the present pass them by.
 </p><p>   Of the exterior appearance of Old London Bridge we need say but
little, the illustration to this, our first part, giving a far more vivid idea
of its general effect, than could possibly be conveyed in words. Yet,
picturesque as all representations of this unrivalled structure undoubtedly
are, yet there is one point which adds so greatly to the picturesque, in
which every attempt of the limner cannot but fail-we mean the impossibility of conveying a just idea of the rapid motion of the angry flood,
and that deafening roar, that ceaseless noise of falling waters.
 </p><p>   Every passage between the piers was so reduced by the great thickness of
the piers themselves, and by the various rows of piles driven around them
for their protection, and called the " Sterlings," that at certain hours of
the tide this river of eight hundred feet in width had to force itself
through narrow ways that, in all, did not amount to one quarter of that
space; so that, at times, the flood was no less than six feet higher on
the one side of the bridge than on the other, forming a fearful cataract
beneath every arch, leading to certain death the miserable wretch who
was drawn within its resistless power.
 </p><p>   The view we have given is of the east side, as seen when coming up
the river from Greenwich, and displays one half of the hundred houses
then upon the bridge.
 </p><p>   The reader will now be enabled, to a certain extent, to picture to his
imagination the appearance the street of the Bridge displayed upon the
afternoon of May-day, <date value="1536">1536</date>, when not a shop door was to be seen without
its little knot of gossips, laying their heads together in a vain endeavour to
solve the mystery of that strange sight they had just witnessed. Every

window that would open (for in those days most of the windows, unless
in the houses of the great, were fixtures, much to the encouragement of
plagues and other fatal diseases) was occupied by two or three, or more
heads, piled one above the other, nodding and shaking, and looking more
wise than those wise heads had ever looked before; but these were kept in
good countenance, by the opposite windows being in like manner adorned
with heads, nodding and shaking, and with equal wisdom too.
 </p><p>   From the upper windows, apprentice boys, who had not been allowed
to go a maying, seemed to be hanging out to dry, so far did their bodies
reach down, in endeavouring to get within earshot of the wondrous
conjectures uttered by those beneath.
 </p><p>   Around one of the doors stood a rather larger crowd than the others-
and over their heads swung a tremendous sign-called "The Bag of
Wool, and the Golden Fleece ;" this sign had evidently not been painted
by the great Hans Holbien, who dwelt hard by, but by some limner,
who, to convey an idea of the happiness derivable from a golden fleece,
had adopted a most extraordinary method of doing so, for he had painted
a most wretched, melancholy, cadaverous looking sheep, dancing about
on its hind legs, and which appeared to be wofully afflicted with the
yellow jaundice, for, in truth, it was one unshaded mass of yellow ochre.
This was no doubt intended to represent gold; but how the large square
piece of, what seemed to be, stone, with four great iron knobs at the
corners, looking as rigid and hard as either of those substances, could by
any stretch of the imagination be mistaken for the soft and pliant bag of
wool, it is beyond our power to divine. This effort of genius proved one
thing--that in those days there were no George Morelands going about
painting signs for a few nights' lodgings, that in after times would fetch
their weight in gold.  Over the shop to which this sign belonged, was
written, in large well-formed letters-</p><p>
        <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"WILLIAM   HEWET, CLOTHWORKER AND MERCHANT."</l></quote>
 </p><p>   "Well," said John Catchemayde, the bowyer from next door-
" What does honest neighbour Hewet say ? I'll wager the best bow in
my shop, and may the curse of Robin Hood light upon every yew twig
I take in hand, if I don't make good my wage, but that if Master
Hewet-now mark me, friends, I say, that if Master Hewet do but open
his mouth, and speak his mind aloud, we shall hear something." This did
not appear to be a very hazardous wager, but Catchemayde looked around,
at those who listened to him, with that peculiar expression of countenance,
half bullying, half fearing, which men at times put on when they have
a misgiving of having gone a little too far, and tremble for the
consequences; but a knowing twitch of the head, and aslight wink from
all the bystanders, as much as to say, " Old birds are not caught with
chaff," soon relieved him of his doubt; and Dick Checklocke, the
smith, after a rather long and appropriate oath, observed-" No, no,
friend Catchemayde, you don't catch us-we know Master Hewet
as well as you do; and well we know that what Master Hewet does
say-he does say; and what Master Hewet doesn't say-he doesn't!
An't I right, neighbours ?-to be sure I am."  Then in accordance
with the fashion of the time, he sent forth   another long  oath,







                       .

     </p><p>      something about the " Beard of Saint Vulcan," or, he added, "by that,
       or any other saint that had ever been a blacksmith-he'd take Master
       Hewet's word, ay, that he would, even before that of his own father
confressor
   </p><p>   Such a wicked assertion made every one in the crowd shudder to the
    very back bone, which Checklocke observing, he crossed himself devoutly
  in a most extravagant manner, and set his lips off at full gallop, but uttered
  no sound, so that he appeared to be making faces at all who looked at him.
  At the conclusion of his inward confession, he called aloud upon " the
eleven thousand virgins of Cologne, and Saint Ursula to boot, to bear
witness that he meant no harm."
</p><p>  "But I repeat it," chimed in John Catchemayde.  "Yes, I repeat it,
what does Master Hewet say ?"
 </p><p>   The person thus called upon, was regarded as the very oracle of
London Bridge. One of the greatest proofs of the profound wisdom of
Master Hewet might be found in the fact of this honest clothworker
never having once got himself into trouble with the state, notwithstanding his reputed wealth.  He was a tall handsome man of middle age,
with a countenance whose expression bespoke more of sedateness
and steadiness of thought, than of aught approaching to brilliancy of
  imagination.
 </p><p>   His doublet and sleeves were of fine brown broadcloth, as were also
  his upper and nether stocks, or, in modern phraseology, his small clothes
  and his stockings, which, being sewn together above the knee, appeared
almost as one. But the portion of his dress, which at once bespoke him
  a man of substance, was his black cloak being well furred with martens'
  skins-the gold chain, too, which hung around his neck, also betokened
  one of no mean wealth; for martens' fur, and ornaments of gold, such as
  chains or bracelets, or collars, could be worn by none but such as enjoyed
  good clear income of at least two hundred marks a year. A pouch,
  somewhat after the fashion of a lady's reticule of our day, hung by a
double silver chain from his girdle, answering all the purposes of a pocket.
A square low cap adorned his head, and enormously broad-toed shoes
were on his feet. His handsome visage was close shaven. all but the
chin, from which a neatly-trimmed beard was permitted to grow. A
small flat white shirt collar, turned down about the neck, and a short
dagger at his side, completed the appearance of honest Master Hewet.
 </p><p>   Those by whom he was addressed (this being a holiday) were habited
somewhat in like style; but their clothes were made of coarser materials,
And no gold, nor silver, nor even a gilt button, was to be seen upon
their jerkins or their cloaks; and even the fur they wore, was merely
that of the lamb.  The different kinds of fur then in wear, formed
very distinctive marks as to tne various grades of society.
Master Hewet, who, up to this time had been paying much more
attention to the piles of velvets and satins, and cloths of gold, and of
silver, and damasks, which had but recently arrived from Italy, than he
did to the gossiping babble of his inquiring neighbours, now finding
himselfhard pressed, raised his eyes from off the tablet, upon which he
had been setting down memoranda concerning the treasures which then
lay around him, and looking steadily for an instant into the faces of







<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>                      .

Catchemayde, Checklocke, and the others, who all stood before the open
shop front, with mouths almost as wide open, quite ready to devour every
word he should utter-he heaved a sigh-then shaking his head, again
commenced writing upon the tablet.
 </p><p>    The bye-standers closed their mouths slowly as they began to look
at each other in evident consternation, and one of them burst out with-
"Quite enough, quite enough !   Let but Master Hewet shake his
head, and we all know what that means."
  </p><p>   " Ay, ay; more trouble, more trouble, my masters!" bawled out
Catchemayde; " and only to think of it happening upon May-day too,
when we all wanted to be so happy and merry."
  </p><p>   "As for myself," said Checklocke, " I'll have a dance on Mary
Overies' green to-day, though they should make me dance upon nothing
to-morrow.  They may hang me if they like-I dare say it's not so bad
when one's used to it; and, by St. Thomas of the Bridge, we are pretty
used to it now-o'-days."
 </p><p>    " And shall be more so yet ! ho, ho! ha, ha ! he, he !" the last " he,
he!" sounding almost like a whistle, as it was screeched out by an
ugly cripple, whose voice made all who heard it start suddenly aside,
leaving him in an open space exactly before the shop of the Golden
Fleece.
  </p><p>   This cripple was a young man, but whose head was nevertheless
nearly bald; nature had from the first denied fertility to the soil upon
which the hair should have grown, and thus the head of age seemed
by mistake to have been fixed upon the neck of youth.  The few hairs
which were found there were perfectly white, but so stublorn in their
nature that they stuck up on end, like so many needles in a cushion;
his scanty moustaches grew in a most remarkable manner from the two
extremities of the upper lip, the centre of which being entirely bare,
gave them the effect of a couple of overgrown hairy moles; habit had
so long been digging deep lines in every portion of his face, by an unceasing nervous grin, that even the placid spirit of sleep could not for a
moment fill them up again. He wore the badge of servitude upon his
left arm, and that badge bespoke him a servant of the bridge; his crippled leg made it necessary to walk, or hobble, by the assistance of a
long staff, which, notwithstanding his lameness, he was known full oft
to use, and that to good purpose too, upon the heads of those who dared
offend him.</p><p>
  How often do we find that where Nature, appearing to have been out
of temper when moulding into form some luckless lump of human clay,
and in her spite has sent forth a thing to show what power she has even
to disgust as well as charm, that in these sad examples Pity has staid
her hand before the unsightly work was ushered to the world, and, as in
Pandora's box, we ever find relenting nature has left at least one little
spark of Hope, the mind to claim    command-the poet's turn of
thought-the music of the tongue -or some such charm shines forth so
briliantly, that our sense becomes dazzled, our eyes are blinded to the
rough mounting, we only see the sparkling gem within.  Thus it was
with the Cripple of the Bridge: his form was crooked, his arms had
been cast in two odd moulds, his eyes were set so deeply in his head,








                       .         <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>

that they ever seemed to be searching the inward man, to find those lost
beauties of which the exterior stood so much in need.
  </p><p>  It was strange that one, whose laugh and sound of speech resembled
more the peacock's screech, or howlet's cry, than that of human breath,
should, if he sang, possess a voice of heavenly sweetness: but so it was;
let him but sing, and all his deformities, even all his spite, and he
carried within his mind a heavy load of it, were, by the power of that
spell, forgotten.
  </p><p>  "Yes, ye dainty pets of mother nature !" he exclaimed, " ye straight-
limbed fools, who, because ye can walk upright through the world,
believe your souls as upright as your bodies, ye shall be more and more
used to hanging, and burning too, or I know not the inward spirit of
your master-your master ! hear ye that ? that master whom HEAVEN,
as we are told, hath placed over you; yes, Heaven, however your
wicked fancies may make you think his devoted love of flames should
indicate a different paternity :" and again his chuckling screech came
forth, as though he thought he had uttered a witticism almost too pungent to be endured: then continuing--" And there, too, stands handsome Master Hewet, whose beauty alone is quite enough to keep him
warm, and counteract all earthly troubles.  Who, with such a form as
that, could ever once look sad? How different to mine ! But we shall see
-we shall-ha, ha ! ho, ho ! he, he! I shall boil his head yet !-I
shall boil his head yet! And mark me, brother Hewet-" and as he
addressed the merchant, his whole countenance changed; the grin
was there, for that never left his features, but it was now the grin
of utter malevolence, as he went on-" Yes, brother Hewet, I shall
boil your head yet! and, by the blue sky above us, I swear that
when I do, I'll drink, and fatten on the broth-ha, ha! ho, ho! he,
he !-I'll fatten on the broth." Saying this, the cripple began to move
away; but still, as he went, he continued to mutter, " Yes, yes; I shall
boil his head yet-I shall boil his head yet !"
 </p><p>   " Well," said Catchemayde, but not until the cripple was quite out of
hearing, " Master Hewet must be a sweeter-minded man than I am, to
bear the insolence of such a cripple; had he addressed me thus, I would
have brained the villain."
 </p><p>   " Like enough, like enough," said Checklocke, "that is, if his hands
had been tied, and his staff in your own; but you know, as well as
most of us, that Willy of the Bridge-gate Tower is no trifling playmate
when one comes to handy-cuffs."
 </p><p>   " You would cease to be angry," said Master Hewet, now placing his
tablet in the pouch by his side, "as I have long since been, and would
feel as much pity for that poor afflicted soul as I do, were you but as
well acquainted with his story as I am."
  </p><p>  "What story ?" exclaimed every voice at once, now forgetting all
their previous anxiety caused by the strange circumstance which had just
occurred at the opening of the chapter, showing how easily the attention
of a crowd may be diverted by a mere chance word, or even the pointing
of a finger, from its most cherished pursuit.
 </p><p>   Checklocke's bravado concerning his not caring about being hanged, was
allowed to sink into oblivion, and every man became a child; for "men







<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>                     .

are but children of a larger growth;" then arranging themselves in true
childish manner before the window of Master Hewet's shop, they became
all ears.
 </p><p>   " It is now some years since," began the honest merchant, " when-"
 </p><p>   "Eh ! what's that," exclaimed Harry Silkworm, the stringer. "Egad,
they're coming at last.  Huzza! huzza ! They're coming, they're coming at last !"
  </p><p>  Every eye and every ear was now suddenly turned towards the
northern end of the bridge, whence arose a loud murmuring, and ever
and anon, amidst distant shouts, the sweeter sounds of music.
 </p><p>   The crowd thought no more of Master Hewet, nor of the Cripple's tale,
but hurried off, shouting and laughing like mad, to meet the coming
throng.
 </p><p>   The cavalcade and vast procession announced by the distant sounds
which had so suddenly put a stop to the, no doubt, interesting history ot
the Cripple, was that of the anxiously-awaited Maypole for St. Mary
Overies' Green.
 </p><p>   It had been expected many hours before, but m  consequence of the
great rains which had lately fallen, the roads, if roads they could be
called, were in such wretched state, that at times great fears were entertained whether or not the Maypole would arrive until it had become a
pole of some other month.
 </p><p>  Great interest had been exerted in the highest quarters, even with the
King, to obtain a reversal of the cruel sentence which had doomed to
exile the greatest pride of the City, the lofty Maypole, that had formerly
every year reared its proud head upon Cornhill, but which had not been
used for now some eighteen years; no, never since the unlucky " Evil
May-day" of <date value="1517">1517</date>. So great a riot had then occurred, that the future
raising of this mighty shaft was by command prohibited.  It was of
such gigantic proportions, that it far o'ertopped the steeple of the neighbouring church, and caused that church henceforth to be denominated
St. Andrew Undershaft.
</p><p>    Now, although the fate of that poor Maypole could not be reversed,
yet permission had been obtained to raise another on the green of St.
Mary Overies, a lovely spot, not far removed from the southern end of
Old London Bridge.
 </p><p>   Great indeed had been the preparations for bringing in from Highgate
the envied shaft; and great indeed had been the heart-burnings engendered between the " Lads of Southwark" and "The city boys." The good
folk of the Bridge cared little which side got the day; they were a kind of
go-between, a sort of peace-maker, or, rather, peace-keeper, for if high
words on either side of the Thames appeared to be but the prologue to
hard blows, they at once raised their drawbridge, and thus kept the
hot bloods apart until a little cooled, and rendered capable of flowing
calmly in the channels of discretion.
  </p><p>  It was in consequence of the great honour conferred upon the Bridge,
by the new Maypole condescending to pass across it, that every house
was now decorated from top to bottom, with green boughs and sweet
May flowers.  Festoons and garlands hung from side to side, and every
Sign was in like manner adorned.








                       .                            <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>

</p><p>    As the shouts increased, and thus announced the nearer approach
of the darling Maypole, all the ladies of the Bridge began to wave
kerchiefs of every colour of the rainbow; for although colours, in those
days, were settled by law, yet that law embraced a pretty many shades;
we are plainly told, that scarlet, red, crimson, murrey, brown, blues,
black, greens, yellows, orange, tawney, russet, marblegrey, with sheep's
colour, and lion's colour, and motley, or iron-grey, as well as puke, the
sadnew colour, and asewer, and watchett, were all right lawful tints;
then what were the unlawful ones ?-no one ever thought of asking that
question, so the answer cannot be found.
 </p><p>   The head of the procession was led on by a noted band of morris, or
moresque, dancers, whose wild antics, and jingling bells that hung about
their legs, gave infinite delight to all who were fortunate enough to
witness the display.
 </p><p>   In one hand, each of these dancers held a shortish stick, highly
adorned with streaming ribbons of varied hues; and in the other, the
corner of a bright scarlet handkerchief: these they continually waved
about, first up, then down, then sideways, then around their heads, but
all the time dancing with their feet in a fashion perfectly their own.
  </p><p>  Wherever a smiling female face appeared at any of the windows, of
rather fairer features than the rest, they all at once pointed their staves
towards the spot, making the lovely face more lovely still, by the deep
blush their notice had called up; and then they sang-</p><p>
                   <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"From Moorish lands we come, fair maid,
                     </l><l>" To seek out Beauty's Queen;
                   </l><l>" But all our toil is now repaid,
                     </l><l>" Since thy sweet face we've seen."</l></quote>
</p><p>
  Then they all laughed at the confusion they had caused to the fair
object of their praises, and springing up, as if to fly in at the window,
all kissed their hands to the beauty, and, with another merry laugh,
moved on to repeat their gallantry a few doors off.
  </p><p>  The first fair dame they had thus singled out, was Alyce Hewet,
wife to our honest merchant; and well had they proved the goodness of
their taste, for seldom had a fairer face been seen than that of lovely
Alyce Hewet: and, yet, beside her stood one, who, although but tnen a
child, gave promise of future loveliness that would, if ever she arrived at
womanhood, throw into shade even the sweet features of Dame Alyce,
the admitted beauty of the Bridge.
 </p><p>   This angelic child was the only daughter of merchant Hewet, and
not a little proud did he feel upon that day, as standing on the other
side of this, his darling offspring, and supporting her upon the window-
sill, while her little arms were playing around her mother's neck, to
observe that not a soul passed by, but made some remark to those most
near at hand, evidently in admiration of what they saw at the casement of the Golden Fleece.
 </p><p>   Next to the morris dancers came the city trumpeters, decked out in
their golden coats of state; to these, succeeded the loud-sounding kettle
drums; the city arms most richly worked in gold and silk and silver,
hung down from every instrument.     Each pair of drums was slung









<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>                   .

upon the back of a sturdy clown who walked before the drummer, or
as he was then called drumslade, and grinned and laughed as much at
the crowd, as the crowd grinned and laughed at him, for these funny
wags of drumslades, would every now and then, just to raise the mirth
and solace the standers by, pretend to miss the drumhead and hit the
head of the luckless wight instead; but it was all holiday fun, so a good
knock could be given, and taken too, with no worse result than a hearty
laugh. </p><p>
   Then came some hundreds of apprentice boys, dressed all in their
best-their cloaks were new, and blue, for the summer months were
coming.   Their white slops, or breeches, were round and somewhat
loose; not so their nether hose, the tightly-fitting broad cloth stockings, which reaching half way up the leg, were sewn to the slops, and
being also white, seemed all in one. Each wore a ribbon of the favorite colour of the ward in which their master lived; their flat caps were
all adorned with a sprig of May, and on their shoulders rested the far-
famed " Prentice Club."</p><p>
   Close to their heels came the Southwark band of musicians playing
upon shlams, and other instruments bearing equally euphonious names,
besides a number of rebecs (fiddles with three strings), supposed to
have been, like the morris dance, the invention of the Moors; then
followed half a dozen bagpipers, the effect of whose screaming music
was greatly heightened by the shrill cornets, crooked like goats' horns,
the trumps and sagbutts, these gave wonderful delight, for our ancestors
were wondrously fond of noise; the next portion might have given
pleasure even to " modern ears polite," for this consisted of a large party
of singing girls, whose voices were well sustained by the pleasing accompaniment of flutes and recorders, that is large flageolets with
theorbos and smaller lutes. After the musicians came a large company
of the " Southwark lads," as a guard of honour to the Lord Mayor, Sir
Ralph Waren, who, with the Lady Mayoress mounted behind him on a
pillion, rode upon a noble, cream-coloured charger, whose gallant bearing,
and tossing of whose head, evinced his consciousness of the worthy load
he bore. The Mayor and his good lady, whose natal day it happened to
be, had condescended upon this auspicious occasion to become the Lord
and Lady of the May. To do full honour to this worthy knight and his
fair dame, the sheriffs, and all the aldermen of the various wards, came
mounted in like manner, each with his spouse, his sister, or his fail
daughter riding behind him, dressed out in all the pomp of civic grandeur. At this moment the sun, as if to smile upon this goodly show of
wealth and beauty, shone forth with redoubled splendour, and caused
the crowd to burst out into an universal shout of heartfelt admiration.
Not only the riders, but the splendid chargers too, were fancifully bedecked with May flowers of every sort.</p><p>
  Immediately after these came the gem of gems, the glory of the day,
the gorgeous Maypole !</p><p>
  No less than thirty oxen were employed, two by two, to drag this
monstrous shaft. The ropes by which they were attached to the machine
whereon the Maypole lay, were covered with flowers of every kind then








                      .                            <pb id="p.11" n="11"/>

in bloom; to each, horn of the ox was attached a nosegay of sweet herbs
and sweeter flowers.</p><p>
   The Maypole itself, large as the mast of a ship, was painted in twisted
bands of various colours. At several parts enormous hoops hung around
the shaft, suspended by variegated ribbons, and thickly covered with
hawthorn boughs and sweetest eglantine, mixed up with roses.  These
hoops were made to move easily around the pole, and from them hung
down long lines of Flora's choicest gifts.</p><p>
   The two first oxen, perfect beauties in their way, were entirely white,
and had the honour of being led with golden chains fastened to their horns,
by the two wardens of the bridge ; the rest were guided by the servants
of the Lord Mayor, in their state liveries.</p><p>
   The rear of this long and magnificent procession was guarded by two
enormous giants, dressed after the fashion of Gog and Magog in Guildhall,
and a joyous, wide-mouthed, waggle-tailed dragon, who ever and anon
threw out fiery squibs and crackers amongst the crowd, which caused
even more laughter than did the score of merry jesters in their caps and
bells, and party-coloured jerkins, whose greatest piece of wit appeared
to consist in jumping upon each other's shoulders, and then falling
headlong over amongst the crowd; this they generally did wherever they
saw a little knot of pretty, smiling girls, around half a dozen of whose
necks the falling jester would cling at once for support, and mostly returned his thanks in a dozen hearty smacks upon their ruby lips.
 </p><p>    Next to this great feat of fun, was that of all the jesters together pulling at the dragon's tail, which being made to give way,
wheneverthe man inside liked to let go the string, they all fell down backwards in a heap.   The dragon then would turn indignantly around,
and puff a quantity of flower from his nostrils, right into the face of any
country clown, who, open-mouthed, might be laughing loudest at the fun.
  </p><p>   Thus, then, moved on the Maypole merry crowd, who, then, as usual
upon all holiday occasions, seemed to forget for a brief space that they
lived in a reign of tyranny, deceit, of fire and of blood.
  </p><p>   The moment the eyes of the good folk of the Bridge were opened to
the splendid delights preparing for them on Saint Mary Overies' Green,
it was deemed incumbent upon them to close at once their shops, for
who could attend to business at such a time?  This shutting of the
Bridge shops was soon done; for most of the shutters were merely large
flaps, hung on hinges to the top of the open shop fronts, and when
turned up, mostly exhibited the name and calling of the inhabitant,
painted in large letters thereon.</p><p>
   These shutter flaps were now being quickly lowered-the bolts passed
through-then the master and his dame, maids, apprentices and all were
seen issuing from the dwellings, and last of all, the careful master,
having closed and locked the outward door, was hurrying after his
family, whose anxious haste could brook no delay.</p><p>
   Almost the last of those who left the Bridge was Master William
 Hewet. On his arm hung his sweet and loving dame, wearing her
 newest fashioned kirtle of Stamel red, which shewed full bravely from beneath her open-fronted gown of lion colour. On her head she wore the
 French hood which became her mightily.     Behind her walked her








<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>

pretty serving maid, with head uncovered, but whose luxuriant hair,
plaited in a most coquettish style, was amply adorned with various knots
of ribbon, that made her look provokingly agreeable. In her hand she
held the lovely child, whom we noticed at the casement of the Golden
Fleece; and after them followed the two apprentice lads.
 </p><p>   These youths were both tall-both slim-but both strongly framed.
  </p><p>  The one as fair as day, whose ingenuous open countenance bespoke
nought but honour and straightforward truth-his name was Edward
Osborne.</p><p>
  The other, Henry, or Harry Horton, was proud of his raven locks,
and in spite of all commands, would let them grow much longer than
the law prescribed, or than were ventured to be worn by any other
apprentice of their ward. His eyes were sparkling bright, and black as
jet; and, altogether, in spite of the apprentice garb, the blue cloth
cloak, with slops and hose of white, stood out a truly handsome lad.
 </p><p>   The manners of these two youths were as unlike as were their
features. Osborne, as they walked slowly to the Southwark Green, was
ever trying to amuse his master's child, by all the little acts of kindness
or of childish sport his youthful fancy could devise. Not so, Harry
Horton-all his attention was directed towards the Hebe of a maid, the
pretty Flora Gray, who seemed, by sundry side glances, and by the
manner in which she received his slily-whispered words, to be upon a
footing of vastly good understanding.
 </p><p>   At the moment they arrived upon St. Mary Overies' Green,'a thousand
arrows, with whistling heads, were shot straight up into the air; this
was in honour of the fixing the Maypole, which had that instant been
accomplished.  The trumpets sounded, the drums were beaten, wooden
cannons, hooped round with iron, were discharged, to add their voices of
thunder to the glorious noise.
 </p><p>   Maidens, almost buried in flowers, had seized the long hanging floral
cords which depended from the Maypole hoops, and now were dancing
round and round, singing a new May-day verse, written for the occasion
by Sir Filbut Fussy, and in which, at stated times, all the bystanders
joined, by way of chorus; and thus it was they sang-</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>  Maidens-" Which is the sweetest month in all the year ?"
    </l><l>Bystanders-" Why, the merry, merry, merry, merry, merry month of May !"
    </l><l>Maidens-" When fall the birds' notes sweetest on the ear ?"
    </l><l>Bystanders-" In the merry, merry, merry, merry, merry month of May !"</l></quote>

 </p><p>   Upon this, twelve young girls advanced towards the seat upon which
the Lord and Lady of the May were enthroned, and as they strewed
May-flowers and roses before them, they also sang-</p><p>
              <quote rend="blockquote"><l> " If May be fairest-if May be sweetest-
                  </l><l>If May be birth-time of hope, oh ! then say,
               </l><l>Which of the months in the twelve is the meetest
                </l><l> To father our fair lady's own natal day ?"</l></quote>
 </p><p>   Then it was that the whole assembly thundered out and danced
about like mad, as they exclaimed-</p><p>
       </p><p>    " Why, the merry, merry, merry, merry, merry month of May.

</p><p>    Oh, how merrily did they sing it-and how merrily did they dance
it !-and how right merrily did Master Harry Horton appear to foot it
away with the poor simple girl, Dame Hewet's maiden, Flora Gray;
while Edward Osborne delighted the good merchant, by dancing and
playing with his darling child, the lovely little Anne.
  </p><p>   We shall not draw too heavily upon the patience of the gentle reader,
by detailing all the good haps, nor all the mishaps, which happened
upon this happy day; nor how the men in the legs of the giants
became tired of their load, and getting from underneath, left the poor
giants without a leg to stand on; nor how the dragon, by mistake, let
off a quantity of squibs in his own inside, and made the place too hot
to hold him-nor how he then tore off his own head, and walked about
all the rest of the day without one-nor how the DUKE OF SHOREDITCH,
King Henry's mock Duke of Archers, with all his mock Marquises,
and Counts, and Earls, and merry men all, challenged the PRINCE
ARTHUR, another mock, but formally-acknowledged, dignatory, with all
his Knights of the round table, who had come from Mile End gorgeously
attired.  This band was formed of the rival archers to those of the Duke
of Shoreditch; but they were merry men all, and the very best of friends;
so, to show the different styles of drawing the long bow, for the solace
of the crowd, the Duke of Shoreditch's party were to represent the
English bowmen, while that of Prince Arthur, the archers of France.
 </p><p>   Great merriment was caused by the vain endeavours the Frenchmen
made to bend the strong English bow, for they pretended not to know
the knack of the craft; so, standing bolt upright, according to the foreign fancy, their arrows all fell wofully short of the mark. Not so the
English side-they, according to their country's style, all threw themselves forward a step, and thus added the whole weight of their bodies
to the bending of their bows, which being done to the full extent, sent
forth the arrow with unerring aim right home to the mark, at a distance of upwards of a thousand feet.
  </p><p>  The law compelling all masters to teach their apprentices the bow-
man's art, a trial of skill now took place amongst these young tyros;
but of this we shall give no further account, than to state how Harry
Horton missed the butt every shot, and that Edward Osborne hit it no
less than four times out of five; and perhaps he would have hit it the
last shot, but just as he let loose his fifth shaft, a disturbance arose
that had nearly put an unpleasant end to all the day's sports.
 </p><p>   The cry of-" A witch! a witch !" resounded from a crowd of unfeeling lads hard by, who were quickly headed and encouraged by
Harry Horton, to hunt a poor old woman. Useless were her feeble endeavours to escape: pushed from side to side, she screamed, and cried
for mercy; but the more hopeless her state, the more the shouts and
laughter increased; 'they bade her " run for her life, or she should be
ducked till she drowned."  Harry Horton cried out-" Tie her by the
legs, and drag her to the pond."
 </p><p>   At this moment Edward Osborne dashed into the middle of the crowd,
club in hand, and standing over the poor old woman, who had sunk
upon the earth, he, with about three swings of his formidable weapon,
in an instant cleared a space of some yards around him.-" You







<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>                    .

cowardly curs !" exclaimed young Edward, his mild eyes now flashing
fire as he spoke; "is an old woman the only game you have the
courage to hunt?  Now, mark me, all of you-if but one dare advance
a single step, until I have raised this poor old soul, and put her in a
place of safety, by my master's honour, and that's my own, I'll fell him
to the ground!"
 </p><p>   " Hollo! young champion of the young and fair," roared out Harry
Horton, laughing aloud, and then added, in a savage tone, " let her
alone, or we let not you alone, or if you must have a bout at fisty-cuffs,
have at you." Saying this, he, with two others, who appeared to possess
more courage than the rest, and who were now armed with their clubs,
rushed forward upon Edward, as he was at the moment stooping down
to assist the wretched woman.  What might have been his fate, thus
taken at disadvantage, we know not, but just, in the very nick of time,
up sprang two new friends to the weaker side, and in a moment more,
Horton and his valiant pals found themselves grovelling in the dust.
 </p><p>   One of the new comers turned out to be our newly-made acquaintance,
the Cripple of the Bridge, whose staff, as we have before hinted, was a
trifle much more likely to make a man cry than laugh.
 </p><p>   The other was a ragged youth, who having dexterously disarmed
Harry Horton, kocked him down with his own club: the Cripple had
settled the other two.
  </p><p>  "Come, mother, come," said the ragged lad, " I knowed you'd get
into trouble if you comed here."
 </p><p>   " Take her away quickly," said Edward; "remove her while she is
safe, and I, and our sturdy friend here, will keep the rabble back."
 </p><p>   The menacing attitude of Edward and his unexpected ally, were not
required to stay the fray.  Now the three most daring had for a time
been rendered powerless, the rest seemed little disposed to take the
quarrel upon themselves; nor was the cry of " A witch, a witch !"
once again repeated.
  </p><p>  " Give me your hand," said the Cripple, addressing Edward Osborne,
" I'll shake hands with you-but it's not every hand I would shake-
but you are a brave lad, and a kind-you have a heart, and that is
more than we can find in every breast; yes, you have a heart, for
you will befriend the old-even the ugly.  I would that you had a
better master."
 </p><p>   " Where shall we find one ?" replied Edward; " his equal does not
exist in London town."
 </p><p>   " Good as you think him," said the Cripple, chuckling, " I shall boil
his head yet," and again he laughed.
 </p><p>   " Why," retorted Edward, shewing some disgust at what he heard,
" why, I say, do you never come near my good master, nor ever hear
his name, but you must utter those offensive words ?"
 </p><p>   " Time will shew, lad, time will shew," said the Cripple. " But
mark me, I am your friend ;" and then came forth his horrid screeching laugh; " there's an honour for you, lad-think of that-Willy, the
Cripple of the Bridge-gate Tower, has condescended to call youfriend--
ha, ha! ho, ho! he, he- !" and the Cripple went hobbling off.
  </p><p>  As Edward turned about to rejoin his master, he was accosted by the

poor ragged lad, who having found a shelter for the old woman, now
returned to offer his simple, but heartfelt thanks.
 </p><p>   After making a thousand bows and scrapes, he said--' I vish I vos
a gentleman born and bred-for then I would ask to take your hand,
and if I did, I think I should squeeze.a part of my heart into it, I am
so grateful for what you have done to-day. That poor old woman,
Master Edward, for I knows who you are vel enough, is my old mother,
and I love her more than my life, for a kinderer hearted, blesseder
creature, I don't think even Heaven itself ever made."
 </p><p>   " Well, then," said Edward, smiling, " if you promise not to squeeze
your heart into it-there are two reasons why I will give you my
hand; first, because a lad who loves his mother, as you seem to do,
cannot be a bad fellow at bottom; the second, because I owe you much
more thanks than you do me. I know the spite of my scowling brother
apprentice there, who has just sneaked off, and who is now whispering
to those two ill-looking fellows. Had he but had his way while his
rage was up, I doubt me little but he would have solved that dubious
point in natural history, of whether I have, or have not, any brains in
my stupid head; for he'd have cracked it or his own club, I'll swear. I
know him, and I know, too, that I have given him mortal offence by my
good luck with the long bow. But I fear him not; for he knows I 've
shown him more than once whose arm is the stronger. But tell me,
who and what are you, since you know who I am ?"
 </p><p>   " Vy," replied the lad, "I'm not exactly a prince as you may see
with half an eye, nor am I a beggar; that is, not a licensed one. Oh
no! a poor devil like me has no interest vith the Court to get such a
blessing as a King's varrant for begging; so, if I does try the trade now
and then just a leetle, I'm obliged to do it on the sly, in a sort of
smuggling way. I keeps open house at the foot of Old Swan Lane, and
the more friends that comes to see me, the better I likes it, and lots of
lords, and ladies, and nobles does come to see me, I can tell you, and
takes me by the arm. Vy, I've been the support of hundreds on 'em."
  </p><p>  " Speak more plainly, there's a good fellow," said Edward, not at all
comprehending what the lad could possibly mean.
 </p><p>   "Vy, you see, how they owes their support to me is this-I keeps
a board for 'em to valk on from the shore to their boats."
 </p><p>   "Oh, I understand you now," said Edward; "you are a Jack-in-the
water."
  </p><p>  "Yes," replied the other, "I'm  a Jack-in-the-vorter, but I'm a
Villiam out on it."
  </p><p>   " Then your name, I suppose, is William," inquired Osborne; " but
have you no other ?"
 </p><p>    "To be sure I have; I've three names altogether," replied the lad;
"I'm  Jack-I'm    Villiam-and I'm   BILLY THE BRIDGE-SHOOTER !
The last he uttered with evident feelings of pride.
  </p><p>   "Billy the Bridge-shooter! that's an odd name," observed Edward;
"how came you by that ?"
  </p><p>   " You see," said the other, " almost all men in this vorld excels in
summut, only it's not alvays found out vot that summut is;-now my.
summut vos found out almost as soon as I vos born."







<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>                   ,

</p><p>     ' Indeed ! and pray what might it be ?"
</p><p>     Vy, I vos born corky."
 </p><p>    "What !" exclaimed Edward, completely taken by surprise.
  </p><p>   "Vot! vy, corky. You knows vot a cork is, I suppose?    Vell,
then, I vos born corky-that is, I'm so uncommon light, that if you
throws me into the vorter, old Nick himself can't make me sink."
</p><p>    "Your definition of the term," said Edward, smiling, as well he
might, "is perfectly satisfactory; although, I must confess, without
your elucidation, I should never have guessed at the meaning: but may
I ask you," and Edward again smiled, " may I ask how your corkiness
was first discovered; for surely you did not, as your words would
almost imply, go swimming the moment you were born ?"
</p><p>    " Did'nt I, though! but indeed I did-that is, afore I vos a veek old.
I'll tell you how it happened; and, my viskers !-only I haven't got
none-if I hadn't been born corky, I shouldn't a been here now to tell
you vot I'm going to tell you, I can tell you. Vell then-mother vos
ill in bed, and fast asleep. Father vos a blind man, but uncommon
clever in household concerns, and alvays looked arter-no, I don't mean
that; for if he vos blind, you know, he couldn't look arter nothing:
but he used to attend to the cooking-and such a cook he vos-"
 </p><p>   " But if he were blind," said Edward, " how could he see which
things he wanted ?"
  </p><p>  " Oh, that vos easy enough! he used to stick his finger into all the
things vun arter the other, and suck it, until he comed to the vun he
vanted. Now, he and mother were dotingly-fond of boiled sucking-
pig; and on the day I'm speaking on, father, who had been drinking a
leetle more than he ought to have done, and had made me drink a leetle
drop too, just to keep me quiet while he vos at his cooking, laid me
down dead asleep on the table, by the side of the pig: off he goes-
back he comes vith the only saucepan ve had, vhich vos an uncommon
large 'un-fills it half full of vorter-pops it on the fire-pops me into
it, instead of the pig, and then pops on the lid. As I happened to go
in flat on my back, there I floated safe enough, for nothing can make
me sink.  By-and-by, as you may suppose, the vorter began to get
rather too vorm to be pleasant; and then, oh, my viskers! didn't I
begin to bawl, and kick about?  Off vent the lid-splash vent the
vorter-mother began to scream out that the devil vos in the pot-in
rushed the neighbours to larn the cause of such alarm; vhen, fortunately,
vun on 'em, happening to be a priest, who didn't care for the devil or
all his imps, volked boldly up to the saucepan, and took me out, to the
astonishment of all. It vos soon settled, that I had been bevitched,
and changed, for a time, into a pig-the real vun the priest took avay
vith him to his own house, declaring that-' He vould first roast the
evil fiend,' as he called the pig, 'and then dewour it;' and ve have
every reason to believe he did. And now, master Edward, do you
think I am wrong in saying I vos born corky. It's because I'm corky,
I'm called the Bridge-shooter.  Ven a boatman's afraid to go through
by himself, vy, I shoots through vith him. If I happens to shoot him
into the vorter, vy, I shoots in arter him, and picks him up, for nothing

can make me sink.  By-the-by, a thought has just struck me-can you
swim ?"</p><p>
    " Not like a fish !" said Edward; " unless, indeed, it be like a flat
 one, which is generally found at the bottom of the river. No, I have
 often tried, but always to but little purpose."
   </p><p>   " That," replied Billy the Bridge-shooter, " is because you have
 never been properly teached.  Now, vill you make me downright
 happy ?"
   </p><p>   "How can I do that ?" said young Osborne.
   </p><p>   "Vy, let me larn you to keep your head above vorter-it's an uncommon useful hart. You have saved my old mother's life, and do, now,
 -let me teach you to save your own, and, may be, a hundred others. It
 is not much a poor fellow like me can do, to the like o'you, to show his
 gratitude; but, poor as I am in all else, if you comes to the svimming,
 I'm richer than any Lord I knows. In a single veek, you shall be as
 corky as I am."
    </p><p>  "Well, I must confess," said Edward, "that is a temptation not
 easily to be withstood; and, upon one condition, I accept your offer-
 you must let me pay you for it."
  </p><p>    " You've paid me afore hand all I means to take," replied the other.
 " No, no, svim for love; and pay me, if you likes, for any other little
 artful dot I may teach you."
   </p><p>   The expression, " dot," he evidently used in the manner we, nowadays, employ that elegant little word, " dodge ;" but we have no doubt
 that, to the "gents" of those days, it was equally expressive and intelligible.
   </p><p>   Edward Osborne, who felt a pity for the poor ragged lad, on account
 of the filial affection he had so strongly evinced, and fancying he could
 discover beneath the dense soil of ignorance, a seed or two, that might,
 by a little culture, grow up into good, suddenly took into his head the
 romantic idea of adopting the outcast as his son, notwithstanding the said
 outcast was at least a couple of years older than himself. But at the
 romantic age at which Edward Osborne then found himself, what
 wildness of fancy could be too extravagant to be seized upon as the
 offspring of the profoundest wisdom ?
  </p><p>    For ourselves, we love romance; it is the bright star of our life-the
 child of hope that takes us by the hand, and leads our steps as sweetly
 on through this world's bleak and barren paths, as though they were
 formed on velvet moss, and lay midst beds of roses.
   </p><p>   Having the romantic fit strongly upon us at this instant, we do not
 find it at all difficult to forgive young Osborne, for the folly, as the ice-
 bound intellects of common-sense people would call it, of the plan he
 had just formed. He had thought of a way to repay his new prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;
 for any trouble he might give him, which he hoped, and fully expected,
 would prove of more real service to this Jack-in-the-water, than even
 money itself. The fate of all these grand schemes will be seen as we
 proceed; at present, we shall merely inform our gentle readers, that it
   soon arranged, to the great delight and perfect satisfaction of Billy
 the Bridge-shooter, that, every morning at daybreak, young Osborne
 should take his swimming lesson.








<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>                   .

  </p><p>  With this understanding, they separated; Jack-o'-the-water was soon
lost in the crowd, and Edward hastened to rejoin his master and mistress.
 </p><p>   The moment he came within sight of them, he perceived that something had gone amiss; his master looked angrily-his mistress snatched
back the child, who had made a movement, as if to run and meet her
playmate-and as to Flora Gray, she tossed her nose up in the air, at
least a yard, when he offered her his arm, and, turning her back
suddenly upon him, said-" Go to your villains !-we want none of your
company here !" And then, with another toss of the head, and another
turn up of the nose, away she walked.
 </p><p>   Poor Osborne, who, in spite of all his endeavours, had never yet been
able to ingratiate himself fully into the good favour of his mistress, saw,
now, by her looks, that he was, from some cause or other, lower than
ever in her estimation.
</p><p>    The truth was, that Harry Horton had been beforehand, and made
his own story good, by reversing the whole facts of the case.  Tears
actually came into Horton's eyes, as he related Osborne's cruel turn of
mind, that could feel delight m afflicting the aged and infirm: but what,
he said, made his heart quite bleed, was, to see so respectable a youth,
as young Osborne had formerly been, now falling into the lowest
degradation, by associating with the vilest of the vile.  " Why does
he not," he continued, " do as I do ?-why does he not associate more
with the good father of St. Thomas-of-the-Bridge, instead of always
being with such thieves as that lad who attends the boats at the Swan-
stairs ? they are always together-always! And only to think, now,
as if it were just to prove my words-look there, yonder, in the distance,
you can see them both-but, alas! they are always together. Good
heavens !" he ejaculated, as if a sudden thought had seized him; and,
then continuing, as though he had been merely thinking aloud--" But,
no, no! that cannot be !-and, yet----"
  </p><p>  " Yet, what ?" exclaimed Alyce, with anxiety, " speak plainly; for
myself, I have always doubted the sincerity of young Osborne; the
more so since our saintly father, Brassinjaw, first pointed out to me
that such unceasing propriety of conduct and such unvarying attention
to his every duty, formed an unerring proof of inward hypocrisy !"
 </p><p>   " If that be the case, dear Alyce," said the merchant, who had a far
less exalted opinion of the saintly father, Brassinjaw, than his wife
had, " if that be the case, I suppose that impropriety of conduct, and
inattention to ones every duty bespeak the saint-is this the reason
father Brassinjaw is so very saintly ?"
  </p><p>  " Such difficult questions, husband, we must leave to the wise and
learned; sinful creatures like ourselves, should never meddle with such
deep matters," replied the truly-good but simple-minded Alyce. " I
fear me often, William, that the new and dangerous opinions, which,
however I try to close my ears to, will still at times force themselves
upon me, have found a grateful soil in your unguarded mind. If once I
thought that that arch fiend, as saintly father Brassinjaw rightly calls
Martin Luther---"
  </p><p>  " For mercy sake, Alyce, do let Martin Luther be still and tell me,
Harry, what are your fears ?" This the poor merchant said merely to








                       .                         <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>

 change the thoughts and stop the tongue of Dame Alyce upon the
 interminable subject of Martin Luther.
  </p><p>   "Why," said Harry Horton, " it suddenly flashed across my mind,
 seeing what I have just witnessed-but Heaven grant I may be wrong
 -but, I say, it suddenly flashed across my mind that it was within the
 pale of possibility, that Edward and that ragged ruffian might be
 found to know more of the robbery at my good master's house, and for
 which a poor fellow, whom I sincerely believe to be as innocent as I am,
 is now in jail, and should the trial go against him, will be hanged.
 You know," he continued, " that it was Edward who first discovered
 the robbery, which had been so ingeniously contrived, that little short
 of inspiration, or previous knowledge of what was to be done, could
 have detected it. He was ever the enemy of the poor fellow now in
 prison, and the sworn friend of the only witness upon whose evidence
 the life of the accused will hang. Now, putting this and that together,
 it strikes me that much truth might be elicited-" here his countenance
 assumed a truly demoniacal expression, but it vanished almost as soon
 as seen, as he said, " could you obtain permission but for a few minutes
 to put him to the rack ?"</p><p>
   " Heaven forbid !" exclaimed the merchant, indignantly.  "What!
give the son of my oldest and best of friends to the torture, for the sake
of a paltry piece or two of cloth of gold ? Rather would I toss the whole
contents of the Golden Fleece into the Thames !"
  </p><p>   " And why ?" retorted Dame Alyce; " as saintly Father Brassinjaw
truly says-" all means should be tried to bring a sinner to repentance."
 </p><p>    " I only spoke for the best, master," said Horton; "and I am sorry,
now, I have spoken at all; forget what I have said-I dare say I am
wrong-and no doubt a friendly squeeze of the hand means any thing
but familiarity." As he said this, he pointed rather insolently towards
the distance, exactly at the moment Edward was giving his hand to the
grateful ragged lad. " I shall live an enviable life when he shall come
to know all I have said."
 </p><p>   " But he shall know nothing of what you have said," replied Alyce;
" you are a good youth and a worthy, and shall not be exposed to the
ill will of any one. You know I am always your friend; and your
master will not gainsay my pleasure, I am certain; so do not fear him,
for not a word shall he hear from either of us; but we will keep a
watchful eye upon him, be assured. Now, Henry, go and join the
merry-makers."
 </p><p>   " No, mistress," he replied; " I will home to my little room, and
prepare myself for to-morrow's confession."
 </p><p>   As he retired, he looked first at Alyce, then sighed gently, and
casting his eyes up to heaven, he looked once more, then wended his
way towards the bridge. What he intended by the look, the sigh, and
the upturning of his eyes, we for the present can only guess; but that
there was something strange in his manner of doing it, might be
inferred from the involuntary, but transient blush which suddenly
suffused the lovely face of Alyce-so slight, indeed, had been the cause
which made the rose to bloom where the lily had been planted, that
she herself was still unconscious of the fleeting change.







<pb id="p.20" n="20"/>                    .
  </p><p>  Poor Flora Gray looked after him in vain: he seemed to have forgotten that such a person had ever existed; she blushed too, but her
blush was felt, was understood, and with it came a frown, for she was
angered at his neglect; this it was, perhaps, which greatly heightened
the asperity of manner she had evinced towards Edward, when he had
approached with a heart overflowing with kindness and goodwill towards
all human beings.
  </p><p>  As Harry Horton hurried along, he let loose to his ill feelings in low
murmurings. " So, so !" said he; " I think I have sown some seeds
this day in Master Osborne's path, that shall ere long grow up and bear
a plenteous harvest of poisonous thorns.  He seems born to be my
rock-a-head. Although years younger than I am, he is still the stronger.
In all things he ever takes the lead; but I may have my revenge yet.
One month more, and I am no longer an apprentice: if I can but once
get a footing in partnership with Master Hewet, I'll work his heart out.
I have found out the length of our mistress's foot, thanks to the gluttony and licentiousness of saintly Father Brassinjaw, who, when the wine
is in, would, for an extra flagon of Rhenish, or a yard of our master's
cloth of gold to give to some fair sinner he would sanctify, tell me all the
secrets of all the wives in Christendom, did he but know them.
There is not a failing of either Hewet or his sweet-eyed dame that are
not in my keeping; and it is upon the failings, not the virtues of mankind, the crafty work their will. How lovely Alyce looked to-day ! but
she has too much of the saint, and too little of the woman about her at
present; but they say a reformation is at hand, so who knows !" and
then he laughed at his own thoughts.  " I wish," he went on, "that
simpleton, Flora Gray, would be less fond. I only flirted with her because I thought she could worm out her mistress's secrets; and now,
forsooth, she thinks I'm over head and ears in love with her, and looks
to be my wife-ha, ha! a pretty wife for Harry Horton! I want no
wife-at least of my own.  No, no! I want fame and fortune; and I'll
have them, or the gallows."
  </p><p>   As the sable wings of night began to flutter over the gay and glittering scene on Mary Overies' Green, preparations commenced for the more
wild and reckless sports by the flickering and varying light of innumerable bonfires. All along the road from the Green, and down the Highstreet of Southwark, as far as the eye could reach, these ancient demonstrations of holiday delight might be seen blazing; barrels of pitch, and
indeed every combustible material the crowd could conveniently lay their
hands on, were heaped upon these burning signs of merry-making.
  </p><p>   The High-street of Southwark was at that time composed principally
of large inns, capable of accommodating hundreds of guests; both man
and horse found shelter there. The most notorious was the Tabard,
opposite St. Margaret's Hill, the well-known inn at which <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> and
his pilgrims to Canterbury slept the night before they started on their
holy journey. It was before this inn now burned the largest bonfire of the
whole, and around it danced the biggest crowd of madcap maids and boys.
   </p><p>  As time flew on, the more sober-minded citizens, one by one, with
their dames and children, left this wild but highly picturesque scene of
frantic revelry.

  </p><p>  Then the moon arose, but, as if ashamed of what she saw, passed on
majestically, and soon was lost to mortal sight. The Spirit of Fatigue
next sent forth her enervating breath across the plain; the strongest,
however reluctantly, were soon subdued, and laggingly strolled
homeward to their welcome beds. The fires themselves seemed tired
out at the roaring life they had led, and sinking by degrees became,
what all things that have lived must become-dust. A few poor worn
out wretches, too poor to own a home, huddled themselves around the
dying embers, and soon, by sleep's great alchemy, became the lords and
princes of the earth.  Thus ended that merry May-day on Mary Overies'
lovely Green.</p>

AFTER the moon had descended on the night of our May-day, thick
clouds overspread the heavens, and all around was dark and drear. The
cataracts beneath the bridge were at their greatest fall, and came down
thundering and raging, as though Old Father Thames was struggling to
dash in pieces the mighty chain which Peter of Colechurch had thrown
across him, and which now was chafing him to madness.  There are few
sounds more appalling to mortal ears than that of raging waters heard
in darkness, it seems like the voice of Desolation calling upon Death !
 </p><p>   The old bell of St. Paul's had just proclaimed that the twelfth hour of
night was dead and had passed away for ever, when a little glimmering
light might be perceived issuing from the small opening to be found in
the basement of Master Hewet's house, which stood exactly over the
fifth arch, counting from the right-hand side of our large plate of Old
London Bridge-then for a moment it was obscured-then it shone forth
again: and now might be faintly discerned the shadowy form of a man
descending by a rope upon the sterling beneath-it was Harry Horton !
 </p><p>   Taking from his breast a small silver tube, he placed it to his lips and
sent forth one long shrill whistle; but, loud as it was, it could scarcely be
heard above the falling waters, that seemed to be laughing in derision at
the puny effort; and yet it must have reached the intended ear, for instantly a window over the centre of the sixth arch opened, and another
rope was let down, at the end of which was fastened a small ship lantern;
this was wavered from side to side, further and further, until it reached the
hand of Horton, who, twisting the end of the rope round his wrist, with a
determined bound swung across the flood, and landed upon the opposite
sterling.  From this sterling a rude ladder, led to the house above.  Before he mounted, he said to the man who was looking down upon
him-   -" Has he come ?"</p><p>








<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>                    .

   "Not yet," was the reply; "but he cannot now be long. There
are some half dozen merry blades here; so up, and be as merry as
they."</p><p>
   Horton ascended, and once more found himself in the well-known
lower drinking-room  of the "Cardinal's Hat," the public of worst
repute upon the bridge.</p><p>
  Amongst the half dozen ill-looking fellows who sat around a large
flaggon of sweet ale, mixed with ardent spirits, was one, who had better,
for his own credit, have been elsewhere-it was no less a personage than
the saintly Father Brassinjaw! This right reverend gentleman generally
found some excuse for passing a few hours every night in this receptacle
of vice-but, he said, "it was his duty to seek out the vicious-the
good could take care of themselves: where vice was, he would ever be
found." And he might have added, that where he was found, vice
surely was.</p><p>
  It was at these midnight meetings that Horton used to gather from
this drunken priest the secrets of all his neighbours, and which he treasured
up, intending, as time should serve, to turn them to his own account.
  </p><p>   The excuse father Brassinjaw made for being there this evening, was
that he had seen the newsman come in; and that he, like all the
dwellers on the bridge, was anxious to learn the real cause of their
recent alarm.</p><p>
  Before newspapers were invented, there were certain men who
made it their sole employ to go about collecting news, which, for a
very small consideration they retailed out to the curiously inclined.
The more respectable of the order, and who could write, gained a very
fair living by sending news-sheets to the castles and country mansions
of such as they could get to be their regular customers-the poorer sort,
like the one now in the Cardinal's Hat, merely ran from pot-house to
pot-house, repeating what they had heard during the day-and some
times much which they had not heard.
 </p><p>   Just as Horton entered, the newsman, a ragged, unwashed fellow,
was standing in the midst of the dirty room, relating what was pretty
nearly the truth-that-how he had just come from Greenwich, where
there had been a tournament-and how that the King's Highness was
there, and Nan Bullen too (for so the common people usually called the
Queen), and how her brother Lord Rochford and Harry Norris fought-
and that how Nan dropped her kerchief, and how Norris took it up and
kissed it, pretending to wipe his face-and how the King, swearing a
dreadful oath, jumped up, and mounting his horse, galloped off to London,
attended only by six gentlemen-and how Rochford, and Norris, and
Sir Francis Western were all arrested-and that how Nan Bullen
fainted, and how it was said that all was a planned thing against Nan,
because the King had a liking for Jenny Seymour-and that how she
would be Queen, and Nan be burnt to death.
 </p><p>   "And serve her right" roared out Brassinjaw, in rather an unsteady
voice;-" she's a heretic, and deserves to be burnt; and so I would have
told the King to his face, had I seen him go by."
  </p><p>  " Neither you, nor any man living, had dared to wag a tongue," said
the host, "had you seen him. As black as thunder is virgin snow

compared to his look; and he came upon us, too, so unawares, that not
a soul upon the bridge, save Master Hewet, who's always sure to be on
the right side of the hedge-no, not one of us flopped down upon our
knees as he went past. I hope the not bending of our knees may not
prove the breaking of our necks."
The discourse was here put an end to, as far as Horton was concerned,
by the entrance of the man he had been so anxiously awaiting; the
man took no notice of any one there save Horton, to whom he made a
sign, and lifting up the trap-door, they both descended to the sterling
beneath the arch of the bridge.
  </p><p>  " Well," said Horton, " have you seen him ?"
 </p><p>   "I have," replied the other, "' a white livered cur, as he is ! Why,
he has no more pluck than a linnet; he's crying and blubbering in
his cell, and swears rather than die, he'll hang us all--a nice friend
that, is'nt he ?  So beautifully as you had planned the robbery too, it
must have fallen upon Osborne; and then for that bungling fool to get
us all into this mess-I could hardly keep my paws quiet as I looked
at him."
 </p><p>   " It is useless railing thus-what is to be done ?" said Horton: " I
thought that if he were once executed, we were all safe enough; but if
he means to peach---"
  </p><p>  " Why, they'll hang us up like rats," said the other; " there have
been too many robberies of late, for 'em to let one of us escape. Now,
his plan is this -he swears that he will not speak out until the last
moment-so that if we put Wallace, the weaver, out of the way-in
short he means murder him-there is no other evidence that can scrag
our cowardly friend: Osborne ought not to appear, but his evidence
does not carry death with it, and it is death only that Miles so
fears."
 </p><p>   "I will provide for Osborne, somehow or other," said  Horton:
" but as to murdering the weaver, I don't like it-a man's blood
they say never dries up-and it's an awkward sight to be always seeing
the red spot dancing before one's eyes."
 </p><p>   " Necessity, even the priests confess, has no law," retorted the other;
"and besides, if we do take one life, we save another, so that strikes
the balance-doesn't it ? and I'll answer for it, that Father Brassinjaw
won't be over hard upon us, at confession, if we do the handsome.
You keep your word about young Osborne, and I'll manage all else so
gently that the weaver shall never say who hurt him. Either he, or we
must die; that's an argument that doesn't require much debating. If
we do kill him, where can be the sin? we do it to save ourselves-and
self-preservation is the first law of nature-' fast bind, fast find,' remember that."
 </p><p>   After several plans had been proposed by Horton, short of murder,
and rejected by his companion, they parted, Horton, as a sort of
excuse to his own conscience, continuing up to the last to affirm, that
he would never assent to the taking of life, but inwardly hoping all
the while, that his own safety might yet be secured, by the other resting
upon his own head the whole weight and guilt of shedding innocent blood.
 </p><p>   A few minutes more, and Horton had again twisted the rope round

his wrist-again had leaped the raging torrent, and once more had crept
in through the window of his sleeping-room. Being there he began at
once to carry out his quickly-formed plan regarding Osborne. In this
unhallowed work we will leave him awhile, and glance into the chamber
of his fellow apprentice.
 </p><p>   Poor Osborne, who until this night had never known what it was to
lie awake scarcely a moment after his head had been placed upon his
pillow, for his mind had ever been at peace, now found himself restless
and uneasy. Sleep fled his couch that night-or if she came near, it
was but to mock him with her shadow, and then pass away.
 </p><p>   Osborne could in no way account for the strange coolness of his master,
and the undisguised displeasure of his mistress-even the smiling
Flora Gray had now no smile for him.
  </p><p>  " Why should I worry myself," he said-" why annoy myself thus
about a circumstance of which I cannot even guess the cause? In the morning I will ask my master openly what I have done to offend him.  And
only to think now, all my clever plans about diving, swimming, and  -"
for a moment the shadow of sleep flitted before his eyes in forms fantastic.
He felt that he was not asleep-and yet, strange dreamings seized upon
his senses. Now he fancied he was the greatest swimmer in the world-
now he was floating upon the surface of the flood, gazing up into the
bright sunny heavens-there he saw his master's lovely child-then a
hand seemed to seize and drag him to the bottom of the river-here old
Father Thames accosting him as his own son, told him "to care for
nought on earth but to trust in him !" Then taking him by the hand,
he shewed the vast treasures he had been hoarding up for centuries-
there were gold, and silver, and sparkling jewels; and in the midst he
again saw his master's child-then she vanished, but the treasure remained, and Father Thames said, "All these, my son, I will give to thee-
but thou must love me-must-    !" The vision was no more. Osborne
again finding himself tossing and turning about on his uneasy couch, said,
</p><p>  " I wonder why our master has this night, for the first time, taken the keys
of the outer door into his own room; at all events it shews he no longer
intends to let his apprentices go in and out as early as they like.  The
Bridge-shooter will wait in vain in Southwark for his pupil-well, I
cannot help it-I will at once abandon the idea altogether-many a
man-has-lived long enough-who-could-not-sw-im."          He was
again in a doze, and again was his former vision floating through his
troubled brain.
 </p><p>   It was strange, but at the very moment he had thus given up all
thoughts of being able to meet the Bridge-shooter, other agents were unconsciously at work to bring about that very meeting. Osborne had this time
slept so long that Aurora was preparing to set her foot upon the threshold
of the day-when just as he was dreaming for the hundredth time, that
Father Thames was taking him by the hand, he seemed made suddenly
conscious that a real hand was on his shoulder; he felt himself
violently shaken, and opening his eyes he started up in his bed,
bewildered and astonished, for there he beheld his master with a lamp
in his hand standing by his bedside.
 </p><p>   " Hush !" said the merchant, placing his finger upon his lip ; "get up







      .               <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>
 quickly, but silently.  I have an affair requiring haste, and secrecy.
 Take this letter to where it is addressed-take this money, too, for you
 must hire a boat.  Your further instructions will be given you at the
 end of your journey.  There is the key of the outward door.   The
 moment you are dressed, begone-but mind you make no noise; I would
 have none here, not even my wife, know of your going until you be
 fairly gone." Saying this the merchant extinguished the lamp, and then
 left the room.  Osborne listened almost breathlessly, as he heard the
 merchant descending stealthily down the stairs: in a moment all was
 still as death.
</p><p>   "Well," said Edward, almost in a whisper, as if fearing to break the
 spell, "this is the strangest dream of all-for I could swear that I am
 awake ;" he rubbed his eyes as he said, "and yet this is certainly my
 room-there is the window through which the grey tint of morn is
 peeping.  But these," he continued, and he looked with astonishment,
for in his hands he could see the letter and the key, and before him on
the bed lay the purse of money.    " No, no, it is no dream: but
what can it all mean?    No matter--it is my duty to obey, not
trouble myself about my master's motives-' quickly and silently,' he
said-he shall be obeyed.  A mouse shall make more noise than I-
aswallow travel less quickly."
 </p><p>   A few, a very few minutes saw Osborne fully prepared. He placed
  the letter and the purse carefully in his pouch, and -with the key in
  one hand and his shoes in the other, that his footfall should make no
  noise, the apprentice now descended the stairs as stealthily as the
  merchant had done a few minutes before.
  Although Osborne placed the key in the lock with all the care of a
  professed housebreaker, yet the lock would creak, and the hinges of the
  door seemed to say-" Where there is secrecy there is guilt."  At all
  events Osborne felt uncomfortable for the moment, nor did he quite
recover his composure until he had hurried on nearly half across the
bridge. Every house was closed, and the heavy dewdrops hung like
tears upon the gay flowers of yesterday, and now weighed down their
heads, as if in grief at the day of sorrow about to break upon one, the
fairest of the land.  All looked cold, dark, and wretched.  As he approached the Southwark end of the bridge, he fancied he heard the sound
od a lute, as if descending from the skies; but his head was so full of his
late fantastic dream, and the strange visit of his master, that he at first
believed it to be but the creation of an overheated imagination-but
no ! at every step the sound increased.  He had now gained the opening
of the Bridge-gate Tower, adorned as it then was by the withering heads
of those who had fallen, sacrificed to the hate or vengeance of a blood-
thirsty tyrant.
 </p><p>   The sound of the lute suddenly ceased, and Osborne started in actual
  affright; for in the uncertain light of the coming day, he fancied he saw
  one of the heads descend from the tall spike on which it had stood, and
then gaze down upon him from over the parapet of that tower of death.
In a moment more, and the sound of his own name struck upon his
ear. " It is well," said the voice from the tower, " it is well; but whither
goest thou this way ?"







<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>                    .

   </p><p>   Edward for an instant stood spell-bound, but was soon relieved from
 his fright by hearing the well-known screeching laugh of the Cripple of
 the Bridge.  "Be not afraid, lad-it is I, thy friend, here snug at
 home, surrounded by my children," and he pointed up to the ghastly
 heads; " they are poor quiet souls now, and give but little trouble to
 any one. But tell me, whither goest thou ?"
  </p><p>   " I know not, Willy," replied Osborne, at once recovering himself, and
 now remembering that in his hurry to obey his master's commands,
 he had taken the worst of all methods of doing so, for he had forgotten
 to read the address upon the letter; he drew it forth, and was about to
 answer the Cripple's question, when his master's injunction recurred to
 him: "quickly and silently," he murmured; then aloud he said-" I
 cannot tell thee, Willy-that is, I must not--so fare thee well."
  </p><p>   Ha, ha ! ho, ho! he, he- !" laughed the Cripple. "Right, boy,
 right, do as the world does; turn your back upon your friends when
 you don't want them." Osborne had turned to retrace his steps, finding
 his orders indicated an opposite direction.
   </p><p>   " Go thy way in peace," said the Cripple; " thou hast my blessing-
 all is ready for thee; he has been waiting an hour past; if you would
 be safe, be quick."
   </p><p>   Osborne, scarcely heeding what the other said, started at a run, nor
 did he cease his rapid course until he found himself at the Old Swan
 Stairs. Now he was more astonished than ever, for there stood Billy-
 the-bridge-shooter, anxiously waiting in one of the best boats, and ready
 to push off at a moment's notice. " Be quick, Master Edward," said the
 lad; " it is broad daylight, and we should have been a couple of miles
 above bridge ere this."
   </p><p>   Edward jumped into the boat; the Bridge-shooter pushed off into the
 middle of the stream, then seizing the oars, plied them so effectually,
 that in a minute more they were well upon their course.
   </p><p>   Osborne looked back upon the bridge, and there plainly saw the Cripple
 running from one to the other, shaking all the tall poles with their
 ghastly heads upon them, as if in token of his approval at Edward's
 departure.  " It vill be a heavy pull, Master Edward," said the lad,
 "vhen the tide turns; for it's more nor a mile, I guess, to Putney, isn't it?"
   </p><p>   " Putney !" said Osborne, surprised; "how knew you I was thither
 bound ?"
   </p><p>   "Vy, didn't you tell me so," replied the other; " that is, the boy
 you sent vith the money, did."
    </p><p>  "I sent no boy, nor money either!"
    </p><p>  "Didn't you, though ! Vell, then, how could I a hired this boat, do
 you think, if you had not ? And how could I a guessed that I vos to
 be at the Swan-stairs, instead of the Southwark side, as ve settled; and
 vos then to row you to Putney ?"
  </p><p>   "As you seem to know more of my affairs than I do myself," said
 Osborne, "perhaps, too, you can tell me to whom I am going ?"
   </p><p>   " To be sure I can," was the reply; "ve're a going to old daddy
 Cromvell, Lord Thomas's father-the blacksmith that vos-the brever
 vot is, and precious nice ale he does brew-there's no pizen in that; no,
no; all pure malt-no hops there; no, nor no brimstone neither."








                      .                          <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>

 </p><p>    It appears almost incredible that a time could ever have been when
hops, so highly valued now, so carefully trained and cultured in our
days, for the sole purpose of adding value to our far-famed London porter,
were considered a vile adulteration, and laws were actually passed
making it a heavy crime for brewers to mix either hops or brimstone
with their malt.
 </p><p>   It was evident to Osborne, although inexplicable how it could have,
or why it had, occurred, that a messenger had been sent to his new acquaintance, and by some one who appeared to know both his movements, as well as the intentions and wishes of his master.  Expecting
that some of the mystery would be cleared up when he should have
reached Putney, he, for the present, determined to dismiss the perplexing
subject from his mind.
  </p><p>   The sun was now shining out magnificently, and as Billy-the-bridge-
shooter, had already had a good pull, Osborne, who was himself no bad
waterman, now insisted upon taking his turn at the oars. His attempt
gained great praise from his companion, who declared, " that if he
would but feather his oars a leetle more, there were few commoners" (by
which he meant not professed watermen) " who could beat him."
Praise is ever sweet, come from  what quarter it may, and ever
proves, although the gentlest, still the strongest goad to exertion, mentally or bodily; so Edward, being praised, pulled away harder than ever,
and soon they found themselves at Chelsea, opposite the old church,
which is still standing near the present Battersea bridge, then a ferry.
 </p><p>   It now struck them, for the first time, that they had had no breakfast; but Billy had not forgotten what they might want, so steering to
the Battersea side, they landed in the fields, and were soon seated upon
the luxuriant grass, discussing the contents of a certain basket the
Bridge-shooter had drawn from the stern of the boat. They rested here
nearly an hour; and it was here that the Bridge-shooter acquainted
Osborne with his old mother's peculiar fancy for being considered a witch
-it was a dangerous fancy in those days.-" But," as he said, " all
human beings have their veek pints, and this is hern. It makes her
happy, poor old soul, so I lets her have her vay; but it costs me an uncommon deal of trouble to keep her out of harm. But don't think,
Master Edward, that she's a real witch; Lord bless you, no! she's no
more a witch than I'm a conjuror, and I don't think I'm much of that."
  </p><p>  After they had thoroughly rested themselves, nothing would satisfy
William, as Osborne now called the Bridge-shooter, but he must give
the apprentice some idea of what swimming was. In a few minutes
more, and he was in Adam's native garb, and floating like a fish upon
the silver Thames.  First he swam on one side, then on the other-
then he turned over head and heels, and performed a thousand strange
antics; now his head was above the water, now his heels-and now he
disappeared altogether. At last he said-" Master Edward, pick up a
stone that you will know again, and chuck it as far as ever you can
into the vorter."
 </p><p>   Osborne did as he was directed, and having a strong arm, the stone
flew an enormous distance before it fell into the stream.







<pb id="p.28" n="28"/>                    .

  </p><p>  William kept his eye steadfastly fixed upon the spot where it had
descended, and swimming there, disappeared beneath the tide.
 </p><p>   So long did he remain under the water, that Osborne at last became
dreadfully alarmed; he hurried to the boat, not knowing what to do for
the best, when, just as he was putting his foot upon it-not more than
three yards from him, up rose the lad, with the large stone held between
his teeth.
 </p><p>   " There, Master Edward, you see I can svim as vell vith my head
under vorter as above it.  You see I vent down there, and I comed up
here; that's vot I calls svimming: and you shall do all that too, in less
nor a veek, or my name's not Villiam."
 </p><p>   The Bridge-shooter now insisted upon Osborne commencing his lessons
that very hour; and while he was preparing, he said-" Remember, all
men are much more corky than they thinks; and it's not so easy to sink,
as vun imagines. To keep your head above vorter, keep your arms
under it. Ven you vont to dive, stick your chin into your chest; and
ven you vonts to come up again, throw your head back, and up you pops.
Strike vell out vith your arms, your legs, and feet, all at vunce, and never
be afraid-it's fear vot drowns a man, not the vorter. Now, I'll lead
you gently out into deep vorter; turn your face right up to the skies,
and you vill see how easy it is to float as upright as a dart."
 </p><p>   So much confidence had Edward in his instructor, that he obeyed him
implicitly; and, to his infinite satisfaction, he found all the lad had told
him come to pass. Before they quitted the water, Osborne had made
such progress, that he now could not only keep himself afloat, but also
felt, that that element which had formerly been his greatest dread, would,
by this newly-acquired art, ere long, become one of his chief delights.
 </p><p>   So pleased was Osborne with the advance he had made, and so
charmed was the instructor with his own cleverness in teaching, and his
pupil's aptness in learning, that both entered their boat in the highest
state of mutual satisfaction.
 </p><p>   Having safely conveyed them to Putney, where old Walter Cromwell
received Edward with a hearty welcome, telling him, that all his old
friend Hewet desired in his letter should be done; and having given
orders to make Edward's humble friend comfortable for that night, we
must there leave them for awhile, and return once more to OLD LONDON
BRIDGE.</p></div1>

</p><p>  MORE than a week had now passed away, and young Osborne's absence
had scarcely been noticed in the house of Master Hewet. There seemed
to be an implied understanding that his name was not to be mentioned.
The merchant had told his dame that he had sent him upon a little
business, and it would have been unbecoming in a dutiful wife, like








                        .                          <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>

Alyce Hewet, to have ventured further question. Horton chuckled at
his own supposed cleverness, believing he knew, even better than the
merchant, where Edward really was, so never broached the subject.
The little Anne was the only one who evinced any sorrow at his long
absence; but she was easily pacified, when her father foretold her playmate's speedy return.
    </p><p>  As the day for the trial of Miles, the robber, drew near, Horton
 became more and more nervous: he thought, that if Wallace, the weaver,
 had been found missing, which his guilty soul translated, murdered! his
 master must have been apprised of it, ere this, and could not have
 kept such a circumstance a secret; nor, indeed, would there have been
 any cause, on his part, for secrecy.
   </p><p>   For several nights past Harry Horton had waited for hours in the
 lower drinking-room of the " Cardinal's Hat," but the man with whom he
 there met before, came not.  On the last night but one before the trial,
 his anxiety had reached a pitch of the greatest mental suffering. His
 lips had become ashy pale-the skin peeled off with fever.    He
 scarcely spoke a word while in this den of vice, but kept his eyes
 riveted upon the door.  Every time a new comer entered, he started
 up; then finding himself again disappointed, he sat down more moodily
 than ever, biting his fevered lips until they bled. Continually did he
 keep muttering to himself-" Something must be wrong-something
 must be wrong." Hour after hour passed away; the great bell of St.
 Paul continued to tell how fleeting were the minutes of man's life-it
 seemed to his excited mind to be ever striking-and yet he came not.
 At last a heavy foot was heard descending the stairs-the door flew
 open, and there the long-expected villain stood. The name this worthy
 bore amongst his pals was Blare-eyed Bully; he had gained this inelegant, but truly appropriate appellation, from his reckless bearing, and
 from the circumstance of his eyes protruding to a truly frightful and unnatural extent.
   </p><p>  " What, in the devil's name," said Horton, unable, at the moment,
 to govern his temper, " has kept you so long away ?"
   </p><p>  " What, in the devil's name," retorted the other, " caused you to
 send your bloodhounds on a wrong scent ? But this is no place to talk
 of our affairs."  Not waiting a reply, he lifted the trapdoor, and, followed by Horton, descended to their former place of conference.
  </p><p>   " Did you not tell me, that in the letter you were to place mysteriously in your master's way, to alarm him for Osborne's safety, you
 would propose, as the best place to send the boy for security, would be
 to the house of his uncle at Woolwich, where we could easily secure
 him, and place him under hatches, aboard of our smuggling boat ?"
  </p><p>   "I did ! and the boy is gone."
  </p><p>   "And the boy has never been there," said the other, sneeringly.
  </p><p>   " Not there ! then where is he ?" exclaimed Horton, with evident
 surprise.
  </p><p>   " That's what I've come to ask of you," rejoined the other; and then
 went on in a more savage tone, " I hate half measures: if you bite,
 bite to the bone! I like not your mincing morsels. If he was to be
 put out of our way, why, put him out at once, say I.  The weaver too,

thanks to your notable scheme of alarming the merchant. Why, idiot
that you are, if Hewet became fearful for the safety of one witness, did
it not follow, that he would be equally so for that of the other ? and so
lie was: and that cursed weaver had nearly escaped us-he, too, had
been sent away to a place of security, as they thought it; but the
Blare-eyed Bully was not to be tricked so easily-no, no, we traced him
out, and - "
 </p><p>   " You've murdered him !" exclaimed Horton, trembling.
  </p><p>  " That's my business," rejoined the other: " what I promise to do,
I do. You undertook to look after Osborne-do it! for I wash my
hands of him. Go into court with a bold face: all will go well, if you
but keep your word about Osborne. I shall be there to enjoy the joke;
and a glorious joke it will be to hear the fools calling for their witnesses-
ha, ha! nice witnesses they'll find. I never saw a dead man yet give
evidence in a court of justice. Oh! it will be a glorious joke; but,
remember, you may spoil all, unless you find Osborne."
  </p><p>  " I have still one hope of doing so," said Horton. " If Dame Alyce
know where he is hid, her saintly father Brassinjaw shall get it from
her, and then the secret's mine. But even if Edward should appear,
he could do but little harm: the weaver is the one we have to fear, but
he, you say, is safe. Farewell, until we meet on the morning after
to-morrow, in the court. Tell Miles, I've ordered a famous feast for him
here, after his acquittal-farewell."
 </p><p>   Although Horton assumed a bold air as they separated, he no sooner
found himself alone in his own chamber, than he gave way to
all his fears. " Man," he said, " is a fool, when he thinks he can
direct his own fate.  I fear I have fallen into the trap I myself
had laid. I am certain Master Hewet had the letter I placed under the
outward door, otherwise, why have sent Osborne hence; but if he took
the warning, as from a friend, why not have carried out that unknown
friend's advice in full ?  The Bully must have sought him in the wrong
direction-my search shall prove more certain."
 </p><p>   Old Walter Cromwell, the brewer, of Putney, under whose care the
merchant had placed Edward, had acquainted.the youth with the true
cause of his exile from the Bridge: this had greatly relieved young
Osborne's mind; and now, having nought to do but to amuse himself,
he gave way entirely to his newly-born passion for the water. Billy-
the-bridge-shooter had so thoroughly instilled into his pupil's mind the
true principles of the swimmer's art, that nothing but practice was now
required to enable him to reach perfection-and certainly practise he
did. Morning, noon, and night, saw him emulating his sire, as he had
called old Father Thames, ever since the night of his water-wonder
dream.
 </p><p>   Old Walter Cromwell had taken a great fancy to young Osborne,
and often did they stroll together into the country around. On the
morning of the day he was to start for London, the old man and he were
out together, when the former stopped before a very humble ,cottage,
lying west of the highway, leading from Putney to the upper gate. It
was called the " Smith's shop;" above the door was the sign of the
anchor, and within was heard the clinking of an anvil.  The old man







.                                      <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>

beaved a sigh, as he said-" Many is the happy hour I've passed in that
old cottage; but then I was young, and to the young, every thing seems
happiness; and my boy Tom was happy, too, before he ran away into
foreign parts, and became a soldier, and the Lord knows what.  I doubt
me whether he is happier now he is called the great Lord Cromwell,
than when he was but poor honest Tom, the smith. He wants me to
go up to London, and says he'll make me a Lord; the Lord forbid ! No,
no, an old blacksmith, or an old brewer, is but ill-suited to a gilded
court; so here I intend to live, and here I hope to die."
 </p><p>     When Edward started for his master's home, the old man gave him a
 kind adieu, and then his blessing.  When he reached the ferry at
 Battersea, he could not resist the temptation of a bath at the very spot
 where he had taken his first lesson in the art he now so much loved. He
 had scarcely prepared himself for the plunge, when violent screams and
 cries were heard from the opposite shore. He there saw a party of
 youths who had been bathing, but one of them had apparently floated
 out of his depth, and was evidently struggling for his life. Edward
 dashed into the water, and, swimming manfully, with the hope of rescuing
 the unfortunate youth, reached the spot just as the poor boy sank. In
 an instant more, and Edward was also gone. Now the screaming and
 cries for help along the shore were redoubled; but in a minute more, and
 all was changed to frantic shouts of delight, for they saw Osborne again
 come to the surface, bringing with him the senseless form of the youth.
  </p><p>    "Take him," he said, now almost exhausted, as he landed upon the
  shore, " take him quickly to the hostelrie, in the lane by the church,
  there you will get proper aid; fear nothing, he is not dead-his heart
  still beats."
    </p><p>  The lads on the shore, who were evidently of the better order, were
  so bewildered, so confused, that they never thought of thanking Osborne
  for the noble action he had performed, but hurried away with their deathlike burden, while he, jumping into the ferry-boat which had come to
  lend assistance, returned to the opposite side, where he had left his own
  boat and his clothes. Having dressed himself, and feeling fatigued, he
  threw himself upon the grass, and in a few minutes, his senses were
  wrapped in a profound slumber.
    </p><p>  When he again awoke, he was astonished to find that the moon
  had already risen high in the heavens; so, getting quickly into the skiff,
  he launched her into the middle of the stream, and was once more on
  his solitary way. His mind was full of his recent exploit; but he now
  regretted much that he had not asked the name of the youth he had saved.
  How   little could he then have guessed, that in after life, not only
  would he know that name, but that the bare sound of it would be as a
  dagger thrust through the ear into his very heart-but we must not
  anticipate.
   </p><p>   " Come," said he, " I have not learnt to swim for nothing: he who
  saves a fellow-creature, has done that, which, though no more than his
  duty, may still make him feel an honest pride for the rest of his life.
  And I do feel proud-and I now bless the hour I met with that poor
  ragged lad; but he shall not go unrewarded-no, no, Edward Osborne
  is not one to make a friend, and break with him in the same instant:









<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>                    .

if he be the lad I take him for, we are bound together for life. I shall
first teach him to read and write-yes, this shall be the first service I
will render him; and may Heaven grant that my boon to him may be
as productive of good as his has been to me. Onward he rowed, and
onward rolled the busy clouds above his head-one moment all was
brightness-the next was deepest gloom. He was now fast approaching
the Lambeth Marshes, whereon no house then stood-all here looked
desolate. As he drew near the solitary tree which grew upon the point
of land, at the bend of the river, he fancied he saw the forms of men as
if struggling together, and dragging something towards the water's edge.
The moon at this moment shone out so brightly that he could clearly
discern four men-three of them forcing the fourth along, whose head
and shoulders were entirely covered with some thick cloth, as if to
prevent his cries from being heard; they dragged him into a boat and
hastened to the centre of the river.  Here the struggle appeared to be
renewed, and the poor wretch, having for a moment freed his head,
screamed out " murder," and franticly cried aloud for help. Osborne forgetting at once the danger he might run, strained every nerve, and made his
skiff fly through the water towards the murderers; just when he reached
them he saw the tallest ruffian raise a large hammer, and dash it with
all his might upon the head of their victim. Osborne's heart turned
sick at the sound of that deadly blow. The body they cast overboard,
but as it fell, it nearly carried with it the murderer, for the poor wretch
had seized, in the death struggle, so firmly upon the assassin, that had
not his coat given way, they had both sunk together into eternity.
They now furiously attacked young Osborne-and in a moment his boat
was turned keel upwards, and he was gone !
   </p><p>  As the tide was running down rapidly, the murderers watched
anxiously in the direction of the flood, and Blared-eyed Bully, for it was
he who had just murdered the poor weaver, said, " Take this hammer,
Bill, and if he comes to the surface again, use it as I did. Good fortune,
like misfortune never comes single. Who could have expected such luck
as to have met with our other man, the stripling Osborne, in such a
place, and at such a time too ! He and the weaver may go together and
give their evidence to the fishes-they'll tell no tales of us to-morrow,
I'll swear. What's that ?" and he pointed to something in the water;
thinking that it might be Osborne they dashed the hammer at it, but
soon found it to be merely an old basket floating by. They looked
around in every direction; not a ripple was on the bright face of the
water; so feeling now secure, the three wretches rowed on towards
Old London Bridge.

 </p><p>  THE  day on which Edward Osborne had been rowed by Billy-the-,
 bridge-shooter up to Putney, proved a day of little less excitement to
 the good folk of the Bridge, than the day before (May-day) had been.
 All London soon became fully aware of the strange scene which had
 taken place during the tournament at Greenwich, and every house upon
 the eastern side of the old bridge, had its windows, and in many places
 its roof also, crowded with persons anxiously awaiting the return of those
 fatal barges, which seldom left the Tower but to revisit it, bearing some
 doomed victim of Henry's vengeance.   It is true, the people of the city
 had for a long time past become so used to the shedding of blood, that,
 upon most occasions, an execution caused but little interest to any one,
 and passed by almost unnoticed; excepting, indeed, when a dash of novelty
 as regarded the style of performance was thrown in, to give a zest to the
 tragic scene-as in the case of the execution of the Bishop of Rochester's
 cook, which brought a great concourse into Smithfield-for it was not
 every day the horror-loving populace could feast their eyes with such a
 sight, as that of seeing a human being cast into a raging cauldron, and
 boiled to death.
 </p><p>  The powerful interest now evinced by the worthy citizens, arose
 principally from  the exalted station of the victim, whom  every one
 plainly saw was already doomed to be immolated on the altar of Henry's
 lust.
   </p><p>  " It's not every day," as Catchemayde observed, "that we can
 see a Queen burnt alive, and I am told, if she's found guilty, she will be."
  </p><p>  "I wish I was a King," said Checklocke, who was looking out of the
 same window of the Cardinal's Hat, " I wish I was a King; it must be
 so prime to get rid of one's wife, whenever one sees a gal one likes better.
 If I only had a set of honourable, upright, Lords and Commons, and
 Judges and Juries, as Fatty has, who would burn their own fathers if
 he only held up his finger, would'nt I have a bran new wife ? ay-
 that I would, by the holy tongs of Saint Dunstan ! and that wife should
 be Flora Gray, dame Hewet's pretty maiden, who's now looking over
 the balcony yonder ;" and then kissing his hand to her, called out, "a
 right good morrow, pretty one."
  </p><p>   " Don't be a fool," said Catchemayde;   you'll have young Horton
upon your back, for she says he's going to marry her."
   </p><p>  "She says !-but what does he say ? there are generally two words
to a wedding, and though she may say yea, he may say nay; for a man
may say what he likes before marriage, though his wife wont let him








<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>                      .

afterwards.  No, no; if I'm  aught of a conjuror, master Horton looks
for something a little above her."
  </p><p>   Whether or not Checklocke meant his last words to carry a double
meaning we cannot say, but certainly they might be so construed, for
at that instant, Harry Horton, who was with Flora Gray in the lower
balcony of the merchant's house, was casting an anxious glance to the
one above, over the front of which was leaning, the lovely Alyce,
her husband, and a young man magnificently attired. This young spark
was an " exquisite," of the sixteenth century. Had it not been for the
carefully-trained small moustache, discoverable upon the upper lip, his
sex might have been doubted, for his dress consisted of a long kirtle,
or petticoat, of the richest white damask silk, fastened in at the waist
by a costly zone of jewels- the body was open in front, but laced across
with cords of gold forming a stomacher, after the female fashion, through
which was seen a chemisette of the finest foreign linen, embroidered
richly with threads of Venice gold. Upon his head he wore a cap, or
bonnet of white velvet bordered, and surmounted with splendid feathers;
this covering for the head was jauntily placed very much on one side,
purposely to show the caul, or netting of gold work, which enclosed his
hair. Rings of precious stones adorned his fingers; and in his left hand
he bore a silver scenter, or bottle highly chased, containing the most
valued perfumes from Arabia. In his case, as in that of some we could
point out of our own day, the " dandy" was permitted by nature to be
the twin of genius.  He was a poet!    Now if a man but attempt
poetry, he must of necessity be one who, at least thinks a little, and
therefore elevates his own mind, although it may be but a trifle, above
that of the common herd of nobodies.
  </p><p>   Our dandy poet was called Sir Filbut Fussy.   He was a young
gentleman who always wanted to be doing something else-was very
youthful, very handsome, very good natured, and very rich. Now a
youth possessing all these advantages, and a turn for poetry and for
music, was calculated to become a great favourite with the generality
of the fair sex, and a great favourite Sir Filbut Fussy was.  There was
a gentleness in his manner, and a seeming sincerity in his attentions,
that proved very dangerous to the female heart; not but some would
have admired him more, had he put on a more manly bearing; but then
they would have trusted him the less, and his great aim was to disarm
them of all fear, and thus to make them weak by their own fancied
security.
 </p><p>   Sir Filbut Fussy, who had travelled much, was now entertaining
the merchant's lovely wife with a description of an Italian meal, and
raised her wonder, and a slight feeling of disgust, at the affectation of
these Italians, whom she now learnt, for the first time, actually ate
their dinners with a fork, instead of their fingers.
 </p><p>   " Yes," said sir Filbut, " I can assure you such is the fact; and I
do hope to see the day, affected as I own it must at first appear, yes, I
hope to see the day when Italian forks, instead of alabaster fingers,
will be employed by all my fair countrywomen, to raise the luscious
morsel from their platters, to their heavenly lips."
 </p><p>   " You really make me laugh, Sir Filbut," said Alyce; " only picture








                        .                          <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>

 to yourself, husband, a whole party of us seated round the board using
 such childish toys, it is really too ridiculous.  And did you ever use
 one, Sir Filbut ?"
 </p><p>  I always do," was his reply; "I own I get greatly laughed at
 wherever I attend a banquet, when I draw forth this little case," saying
 which, he produced a small velvet casket, whence he took a very diminutive fork, made of Milan steel.  " I believe," he said " I am the first who
 ever used a fork in England."
  </p><p>   " And I hope you will be the last," said Hewet; "we have already
 too many foreign fancies brought here: since it has become the fashion
 of finishing a youth's education by sending him abroad, all our good
 plain old English ways are becoming subjects of ridicule and contempt
 with the rising generation."
 </p><p>  " I wonder," observed fair Alyce, "our Queen, who, when plain
Anne Boleyn was so much in foreign lands, has never yet rendered
this affectation of the fork fashionable."
 </p><p>     " That is easily accounted for," replied Sir Filbut; " the using of a
  fork would too much expose the sixth finger on her left hand; and we
  know her deformities are subjects she likes to keep concealed, witness
  the collar-band she wears about her neck, to hide the strawberry growing
  there."
 </p><p>   "If all the reports be true," observed the merchant, " it will grow
  there but little longer; yet I cannot bring my mind to credit half the
  vile tales now circulating through the town, such wholesale depravity they
  accuse her with ! Why, even her own brother is already a prisoner in the
  Tower; and Alyce's poor music-master, Smeaton, too, he little thought,
  poor fellow, on the day he came to tell us of his great good fortune, as
  he then thought it, in being called at court the favourite minstrel of the
  Queen, how dangerous a post his talents had raised him to."
 </p><p>     " But, still,' said Alyce, " so good and great a King as Henry is,
 would never act like this without some fair cause for doing so."
  </p><p>    "You are right, sweet Alyce," said Sir Filbut, forgetting for a
  moment that her husband stood so near; he fortunately did not hear
  the tender expression, nor did he see the blush that suffused her angelic
  face-Sir Filbut marked it, but pretending not do so, continued, " quite
  right, it is a fair, a right fair cause, and that fair cause is fair Jane Seymour !"
  </p><p>    " Why, Jane Seymour is one of the Queen's own maids of honour,"
  observed Hewet.
  </p><p>    " And was not Anne Boleyn one of Queen Catherine's own maids
 of honour ?" replied Sir Filbut; " if she supplanted good Queen Catherine, she pointed out the way for others to supplant herself; she lacketh
 wisdom, or she never would have had so fair a maid as Jane within the
 reach of one so quickly touched by beauty as is her own dear lord.
 He always had a penchant for maids of honour, although I fear me, not
 alway honourable maids."
   </p><p>   Great crowds of boats now appeared in the distance, and then began
 loud shouts, and yells, and hootings, which continued until the barge
 containing Anne Boleyn, her uncle the Duke of Norfolk, her deadly foe







<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>                   .

the Duke of Suffolk, Cromwell, and others of the Council, reached the
water-gate of the Tower.
 </p><p>    The moment the boats had appeared in sight, Sir Filbut Fussy, who,
as we have before said, always wanted to be doing something else, now
took his leave, saying he would just go round to the Tower, see the
Queen land, and having collected all the news he could, he would return
at their evening meal to relate what he should have learnt, and give
Alyce a lesson in the use of the Italian fork, and, if he might be allowed so great a happiness (here he slightly sighed), present her with one he
had at his lodging, made of Venetian gold.
 </p><p>    As Sir Filbut descended the dark stairs, he met Harry Horton, who,
whispering, said-" How speeds your cause, good sir ?"
   </p><p>  " But indifferently well," the other answered: " that dolt, her husband,
never left us for a moment. I ventured once to say sweet Alyce; she
blushed, but took it kindly-at least, she frowned not."
 </p><p>   "Few fair onesfrown upon Sir Filbut, I would swear," said Harry.
 </p><p>   Not many, truly," said the Knight. "Oh, no, where'er Sir Filbut
Fussy goes, he's ever smiled at."
   </p><p>  " And laughed at, too," thought Horton, within himself.  "But,
good Sir Filbut, have you thought further about the diamond you spoke
of? There's nothing wins a woman half so soon as diamonds."
  </p><p>   " I'faith, I have, and here it is; take it, good Horton, but, prithee,
be careful of it, for it is a costly gem, and worth a dozen other women;
but Alyce, pretty Alyce, is worth a dozen gems like that."
  </p><p>   " And the purse for Flora ?" said Horton; " she's an avaricious
jade, and said her services must be but lightly valued, if weighed by
such a purse as that you sent her last. I wish, to my very heart, we
could have done without her; but, as she was determined to use her
eyes, I thought it best to fasten a golden chain about her tongue; at all
events, I've kept her quiet: even you, yourself, would never guess that
she knew ought of what was passing."
 </p><p>   " You are, indeed, a friend," observed Sir Filbut, taking Horton's
hand; " but how do you propose to give sweet Alyce the diamond
bauble, so as not to raise suspicion ?"
 </p><p>   " Leave that to me," was Horton's reply. " If once you see her wear
it on her neck, you'll know it has been received right kindly. But,
pray be cautious, Sir Filbut, and remember, it is gratitude alone that
makes me act the part I do; but you have ever bound me to your
service, by aiding to save me from the fangs of that vile Jew. Alas!
alas ! that I should have ever been so weak; perhaps, with years, I
may become as wise as you, Sir Filbut, and escape the snares so often
laid for youth.  I know not how to ask it-but-no, you have done too
much already for my service-and yet, if he should take me for that
debt, who then could be your friend in this affair ? I fear, for your sake,
I must speak out-yes-yes, I must--"
 </p><p>   " You alarm me !" said Sir Filbut. " Speak quickly, then, be
whate'er it may."
 </p><p>   " He swears he'll have me, or another hundred marks !"
 </p><p>   "Is that all!" replied Sir Filbut, breathing more freely-" the
money's yours."








         .                          <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>

      </p><p>   Too generous man !" replied Horton, with a voice almost stifled by
       overflowing gratitude, as he received this second purse; " but remember,
     it is but a loan. I keep a strict account, I can assure you, sir,-this
       makes  the fifth hundred I have had."
     And you shall have five hundred more, if Alyce will but fly with
     me to Italy."
   </p><p>    Hush, hush! walls they say have ears. I have fortunately got
     rid of my prying brother apprentice, and all for your good service.
   </p><p>      Hark, I hear a footstep; farewell, and may good fortune smile upon so
  generous a friend."
   </p><p>    Saying this, he re-entered the room he had come from, slamming the
  door suddenly, almost against the nose of poor Sir Filbut Fussy, who
  was about to make reply.  Sir Filbut looked at the door for a moment
  with a gaze of intense meaning, as if about to ask it some question;
  but, we suppose, not expecting to get any answer, he turned away and
  proceeded towards the Tower.
  </p><p>  "Any one would think, my dear," said the merchant to his fair
dame, "you were half in love with Sir Filbut. I see but little in his
poetry, that you extol so highly, and much less in himself to be admired."
  </p><p>     "He must see enough in you to admire, William," Alyce replied;
   "for he is ever seeking your society."
   </p><p>    "Any man who has a pretty wife, my dear, is seldom without some
 dozen butterfly attendants, fluttering about the sweet flower he has
   gathered to adorn his own breast with. Although I will not pay myself
 so ill a compliment, nor offer such an insult to my wife, as to be fearful
of Sir Filbut, yet I had rather he stayed away a little more, or gazed at
  you a little less."
  </p><p>    "Now you are jealous, my dearest husband, I am sure you are; and
 I am not sorry that you be; for it proves that Alyce is, in your dear
 eyes, still worth the guarding. Only be kind and true yourself, dear
   husband, and then you need fear nor sir, nor lord, nor duke! Believe
   me, that kindness and truth on a husband's part will seldom fail to prove
   the surest lock and key to secure a wife's affections."
     How much longer this dove-like t&#x00E9;te-a-t&#x00E9;te would have continued,
   Cupid alone can tell, but it was now put a stop to by the renewed
   shoutings and hootings which ascended from those upon the river. The
   barges stopped at the Tower, and it was at this moment, as history
   informs us, that the doomed Anne Boleyn fell upon her knees in the
   barge, exclaiming, " Oh, Lord, help me, as I am guiltless of that whereof
   I am accused !"
    </p><p>   "It's a sad sight," said Alyce to her husband, " nd brings with it
  the sad reflection of how transient is man's love. It is but three years,
  this very month, that I stood here to behold the gorgeous pageant of
  bringing that same Queen in triumph, and from Greenwich, too, whence
  now she comes in such sad plight-three little years, and all is changed.
  The adored, the madly-beloved, Anne Boleyn, is now the despised Queen
  Anne. Yesterday was an evil May-day for her, poor soul! It is strange,
  but how many dreadful things have occurred in May. It was on the
  19th of May--"
   </p><p>    "That we were married," said Hewet.





     <pb id="p.38" n="38"/>          .

 </p><p>    "Now, that's unkind, William; do you consider that a dreadful
thing ?" inquired Dame Alyce.
  </p><p>   "No, no, my love; I didn't mean that-and Heaven grant it may
never prove so ! Yet it is true. that in that fatal month we joined our
hands, and hearts too, I hope. It was in May that Rome was sacked
and Bourbon killed; it was in May the dreadful sweating sickness
seized on London; we were courting then; how anxiously I used to
watch and pray for you, dear Alyce ! Queen Catherine was tried in
May; and it was in May, too, that good Sir Thomas More's misfortunes first commenced; and was it only last year in May, that John
Houghton, the worthy prior of the Charter-House, with Webster,
Lawrence, Reynolds, and John Hailes, were all drawn, hanged, and
quartered ?"
  </p><p>   " But you forget," said Alyce, "the darkest day of all, that happened
nineteen years ago-the dreadful 'Evil May-day."
  </p><p>   " Forget it, never! for on that day I first saw you-it was an evil
May-day !"
 </p><p>    Poor Hewet seemed to be very unfortunate in his manner of placing
certain recollections; but not being aware himself of his apparent want
of gallantry, he continued--" Ah! Alyce, you were a child then, like
our own sweet Anne, and little did I think that evil day would fix my
after fate."
 </p><p>    The Queen being now safely lodged in the Tower, the crowds began
to disperse ; the roofs and windows were soon deserted; the inhabitants
of the bridge resumed their usual occupations ; and all the stream of
life seemed to be again flowing on, as if no strange event had just
occurred, or that there were no forebodings of troubles soon to come,
worth one serious thought.
   </p><p>  Being anxious to explain several circumstances which happened soon
after the dreadful murder of the weaver, and the loss of Edward Osborne, we shall touch but lightly upon the promised return of Sir Filbut
Fussy at the good merchant's evening meal; yet we must not omit to
mention that, be the cause what it might, whether it were done to charm
her husband, or flatter Sir Filbut Fussy, or only arose from female
anxiety ever to be admired, it is certain that Alyce Hewet, on the
evening in question, had bestowed more than common pains upon her
personal attire. Her whole costume had been changed for one of richer
style, and one that set off her lovely figure to the greatest advantage.
The floor of the room, too, was newly strewn with fresh rushes, and
that rather uncommon commodity in those days, the Turkish carpet,
was brought out, not to be trodden under foot, but to be employed by
way of a table-cover.  This circumstance leads us to believe that the
first carpets introduced into England were the small prayer-carpets used
by all good Mussulmen. We, ourselves, have seen a Persian prayer-
carpet employed in this way; and a very elegant table covering it makes
to the eye, but is rather too thick and stiff for comfort to the touch.
  </p><p>  When Sir Filbut Fussy did arrive, he had nearly swooned with
ecstatic delight, on perceiving his splendid diamond adorning the fair
neck of Alyce. So overpowering was its effect upon his nervous temperament, that now, instead of wishing, as was his wont, to be doing








       .                      <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>

    something else, he now wanted to be doing everything at once. He
  soon delivered himself of all the load of information he had gathered at
  the Tower, of how Anne Boleyn, for he said-" Already she ceases to
  be called the Queen," was not to go into a dungeon, as many thought
  she should have done, but was to be a prisoner in the same apartment
  she slept in the night before her coronation; but that her two greatest
  enemies, her own relation, Lady Boleyn, and Mistress Cosyns, were to
hold her under the most insulting espionage: that, although her five
accomplices were not yet tried, and by most considered innocent, it was
still perfectly understood, that Smeaton, the musician, would first be
racked, then hanged-the others beheaded. " The only doubt," he said,
" lay in the fate of Anne Boleyn; but about her there was certainly
a doubt !"
  </p><p>     " Then the poor soul," said Alyce, with all a woman's pity for her
 sex in sorrow, " she may yet be saved ?"
  </p><p>   "Saved !" replied Sir Filbut, slightly smiling at so preposterous a
   thought. "Saved! oh, no! the only doubt is whether she be sent to
 the block, or to the flames; knowing, as I do, the King's tender nature,
 I should say the latter: much will depend on what Jane Seymour wish.
 It was to please Anne Boleyn he beheaded Moore, so now he may,
 perchance, behead herself to please her rival, for he is wondrously
 obliging to the fair; however, we soon shall see, for Henry, we know,
 is far too good to keep his subjects in suspense.  ' A little longer, and
 Nan's a little shorter,' I heard a smith facetiously observe, as I came
 by, and, perhaps, the smith was right: 'but what matter is it to us-
 a burning, or decapitation, will each alike be cause of holiday,' so say
 the people. By Apollo's self, fair Alyce, what a lovely lute !"
  </p><p>     Sir Filbut sprang forward to examine a beautiful instrument the merchant's wife had just taken up, but in doing which, unfortunately,
  he trod upon the tail of her favourite little dog, who yelping, snapped
  so furiously at Sir Filbut's ankles, that taken off his guard, he kicked
  the animal nearly through the wall. Now, if there be aught on earth
  more likely than aught else, to put a sudden frustration to a lover's
  hopes, it is the accidental treading on a favourite poodle's tail-no
  matter what the love before, depend upon it, you are hated then--
  hated ?-despised !
   </p><p>    Sir Filbut Fussy felt all this, and hurried to redeem the ground he had
  lost, by flying to caress the " little dear ;" but here again a new disaster
  befel Sir Filbut, of scarce less magnitude than the first, for not perceiving the lute which Alyce had let fall when springing to her darling pet,
  he literally " put his foot in it," and as the strings became entangled
  in his broad roseats, he danced about in vain endeavours to kick off this
  overgrown unnatural-looking wooden shoe.
    </p><p>   Now, the ladies of the olden time being more accustomed to chines of
  beef and nut brown ale than are the fair one's of our own day, Alyce
  let slip the finest opportunity of shewing off her proficiency in the fainting art that may occur once in a hundred years-no, there was then, we
  believe, more nature, therefore less hysterics, than is thought fashionable
  at present, so Alyce merely let fall a tear or two for her Juno's sufferings, and then began to smile at Sir Filbut Fussy's perplexing situation.



<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>                     .

  There were, however, one or two redeeming points about this unfortunate contretems in favour of Sir Filbut, for it enabled him to shew
his tenderness of disposition by gently wiping the little dog's tear-filled
eyes, and kindly kissing the little dog's wounded tail, which he did until he completely won, not only the forgiveness of the little dog, but of
its mistress too. The affair of the lute was much more speedily arranged, for Sir Filbut sent one of his serving men in waiting, at once, to
his lodging to fetch his own costly theorbo, which was a lute of larger dimensions than the common instrument, and which he now prayed, as he said,
" on bended knee," and had her husband not been present, there is little
doubt, but he would have prayed of her in that position, " to accept it as
token of her forgiveness."  His prayer as well as his theorbo being received, they all sat down to the evening meal with great good will.
Sir Filbut insisted, in spite of all remonstrance from Dame Alyce, or her
spouse, that little Juno should lie upon his lap, and be fed with the
choicest morsels.
  </p><p>  A gentleman of Sir Filbut Fussy's rank being present, the table was
laid out with holiday attention. Not a wooden platter was to be seen,
as on common days, but all were polished pewter. The winter six
months having ended at April, the salted viands, which always constituted the daily food, for half the year, of our good ancestors, now had
given place to fresh meat, and to fowl, not that the feathered tribe were
often seen but upon the tables of the upper classes. But our merchant,
William Hewet, was a thriving man, and a rich, and could well
afford vegetables when he would, as well as dainty birds, such as capons
of Greece, although they cost a shilling and two groats a-piece, while
common capons cost but sixpence each, and common cocks but threepence.
But, notwithstanding Hewet was so prosperous and wealthy, he complained bitterly, as people always do, of the high price that food had
reached. " He could not," he declared, " buy a whole sheep of any
' flesher,' no, not even if he went as far as butcher-row, without the
walls, for less than two and tenpence: and hogs," he said, " were just
as dear; three and eightpence was now the common charge; and even
sucking-pigs would cost you sixpence; the common pullet was, perhaps,
the cheapest thing at twopence, but if you wanted very good, they'd
make you add another ha'penny: and as to eggs !" here the merchant
really raised his eyes in horror--" yes, eggs! for tenpence, you could
only get a hundred !"
 </p><p>   I wonder what our London market people would say, in these our
days, to such high prices!
 </p><p>   The little golden fork was not forgotten; and Harry Horton, being
the youngest there, having, as was his duty, carved the meat for his
mistress in her platter, she almost choked herself with laughing at her
own absurd attempt to use it as elegantly as did Sir Filbut.
 </p><p>   What a moment of happiness and hope was this for Sir Filbut Fussy '
He had to guide her sweet hand to her sweeter lips; in doing so, it
could not be wondered at, if he found it necessary to squeeze her delicate
fingers slightly, which, we must confess, Sir Filbut did; but Alyce was
too highly amused with what she herself was doing, to notice any little
nnecessary pressure, which, no doubt, only arose from his anxiety, that








                                                   <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>

   she  should hold the Italian fork in a manner not to let it drop.  Now,
   the most apt scholar there turned out to be little Juno, for whenever
   Sir Filbut had loaded his own fork with a delicious morsel, and turned
   his head but for a moment to attend to his fair pupil, Juno quietly
   took it off and ate it.  This had occurred more than once to the unconscious Sir Filbut Fussy, whose mind was lost in wandering about in
   fancy's fairest garden.  He saw but one object-he felt but one
   sensation: it seemed to him, as if Hope herself were holding to his eye
   magnifying glass, through which but one bright star appeared-that
   star was Alyce Hewet.  This delightful little scene of innocent flirtation
 might have lasted, we know not how long, had not Juno suddenly put a
    stop to it, by yelping horridly, as though he were in the act of strangulation. Imagine Alyce's horror, on looking at her favourite, whose eyes
    seemed starting from its head, to find Sir Filbut's fork nearly half way
    down its throat. The little animal had so much admired his new style
 of being fed, and observing a larger piece than usual, as he thought
    politely offered to him, made such a determined bite at it, that he had
 nearly swallowed fork and all.  He was, however, soon relieved; but
    Dame Alyce declared, that from that moment, so dangerous an instrument should never again come within its reach. She took the dog into
  her own charge, then calling for her horn spoon, she, with that, aided
  by the use of the fingers of her left hand, finished her evening repast.
  She accepted of the golden fork, for she regarded it as a great curiosity;
  and she asked her husband, if he did not think it might be employed,
  very becomingly, as an ornament for the hair?  After the surnap, or
    small upper tablecloth had been removed with the dishes, and a few
 of the scanty supply of fruits then to be obtained having been placed
 upon the table, accompanied by some flasks of those delicious sweet
   wines, Malmsey and Romney sacks, which then cost a shilling a gallon,
   the child-the lovely little Anne, was brought into the chamber.
   </p><p>  Sir Filbut Fussy, who knew full well, that next to a lady liking herself to be admired, generally feels pleasure in hearing her offspring
praised, now threw himself into perfect raptures with the " little angel."
  As there was no doubt about the exquisite beauty of Anne, Sir Filbut
declared he never beheld two countenances so exactly alike as those of
    Dame Alyce and her child; he scanned and compared every feature, one
    by one; but when he came to the comparison of the eyes, Sir Filbut
    Fussy looked'so languishingly into those of Alyce, and put on such a
ridiculous expression of annihilating tenderness, that the good dame
    could no longer resist a smile, so feeling confused, she turned away, and
proposed that they should have a little music.
   </p><p>  " Ay, do, sweet one," said the merchant kindly to his wife, " and
   then I think Sir Filbut will in truth wish you had not got a husband."
   Sir Filbut did, but this he kept to himself; and honest Master Hewet
   went on-" Yes, Sir Filbut, when you have heard her, I am sure
   you will confess there is not in London town a prettier toucher of the
   virginals than Alyce Hewet."
    </p><p>     Sir Filbut ventured to say--he did not think there could be a prettier
    anything in the whole world than Alyce Hewet; saying which he made
                6







<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>                     .

a profound bow to the lady, who, smiling, seated herself at the virginals, a sort of spinet, from which our modern pianoforte is derived.
 </p><p>   Sir Filbut seized upon the theorbo he had just presented to A'yce;
the merchant, without being asked to do so, at once began to tune his
rebeck, or three-stringed fiddle; Harry Horton took up a flute; and
Flora Gray, who was really a very pretty singer, was desired to be the
leader of the vocals.  Now, at all amateur concerts, the greatest difficulty to be overcome, is getting the various instruments in tune one
with the other.   There is generally a great diversity of opinion in the
ears of amateurs, and so it proved upon the present occasion. Now,
there is another remarkable circumstance, and that is, should there be a
husband present, that husband is sure to be the one most blamed.
This also was exemplified upon the present occasion, for do what Master
Hewet would. whether he turned the pegs up, or whether he turned the
pegs down, he was always wrong.
  </p><p>  Flora Gray, who, perhaps, saw something more than pleased her, ventured to advise her master to be "a little sharper!" but this had a contrary effect to what she had intended, for it made her mistress " a little
sharper," who pettishly desired Flora to be still, observing, that " not
only now, but whenever any gentleman played with her, and her husband accompanied them, she always found him a great deal too sharp."
 </p><p>   It now became the turn of Harry Horton and Sir Filbut Fussy to
tune their instruments together, but here there was more jarring than
ever; Harry declared that " he was in perfect accord with his mistress,"
at which Flora nodded her head, as much as to say, she thought so too;
"and," said Harry, " that being the case, Sir Filbut, you must follow
my advice, and be sharper-sharper-sharper-sharper."  Poor Sir Filbut screwed, and screwed, but do what he would, he could not get to be
so sharp as Harry Horton.  By degrees, Sir Filbut finding himself closer
and closer to the lovely Alyce, and Flora Gray having received a kind
look from Horton, and placed her arm unseen by any one, through his,
and the merchant having turned his back upon the whole party, in order
to look more easily at his music, they all suddenly discovered that they
were perfectly in tune, and so the concert began.
 </p><p>   Grand was the crash, as the reader may suppose, when so many fine
performers struck up together. Away they played for dear life. What did
it matter to them  whether they came in at the right place or not ?
Sir Filbut and Flora Gray felt that they were in the right place, so that
was a good way towards things going on smoothly.  The poor husband,
as usual, came in for a sharpish reprimand, for when all else had left
off, he kept on playing by himself for at least a dozen bars.  This he
accounted for by having turned over two leaves instead of one, so that
he had all through been fiddling the accompaniment of a perfectly different piece of music, and in a different key too.
  </p><p>   As a punishment, his wife desired him to sing a song, forgetting at
the moment that the punishment would be theirs, not his-for Master
Hewet never sang but one song in his life, and that was "Simon Frisell,"
a very ancient ballad, even three hundred years ago.  As our gentle
readers might like to know what really pure English was in those days.

we will insert one verse of Master Hewet's ten verse infliction; thus
it ran :</p><p>
              <quote rend="blockquote"><l>He rideth thourth the site as J tell may,
                </l><l>With gomen and with solas that wos here play.

</quote>
 </p><p>   The sound is certainly pleasing to modern ears, but means neither
more nor less, than that-he rides through the city, amidst the rejoicings
of his enemies, and that his head stands on the town bridge, close by
that of William Wallace.    The heads of Sir William Wallace and of
Sir Simon Frisell-or Fraser, are supposed to have been the first ever
placed above the Traitor's Gate, on Old London Bridge.
  </p><p>  After this the pretty Flora sang a ballad, every verse ending with
something about " Naughty Harry of the Hill." The words told a story
that had often been told before, and has often been told since, that how
a poor young girl loved a rich young man, much better than a rich
young man loved a poor young girl; and that how she ultimately had to
repent having listened to " Naughty Harry of the Hill."
 </p><p>   Then Sir Filbut sang a song of his own authorship, and his own composition, but this was of a rather better order, for, with all his vanity
and folly, Sir Filbut Fussy possessed many of the attributes of a real
poet, and of the genius of a musician; we shall by-and-by, have a more
fitting opportunity of criticising his poetical and musical capabilities, and
shall, therefore, now pass him by with this general remark, that every
word he sang was of love, and every line he sang with pointed emphasis towards the beautiful Alyce.
 </p><p>   The entertainments of this charming evening, were wound up by a
sort of round or chorus, each singing a verse, and the symphony was
taken up by all the instruments, somewhat after the fashion of the
modern Ethiopian Serenaders.
  </p><p>  The words have been old for some hundreds of years, and in those days
were universally admired, therefore there was no difficulty in each person
present taking a verse. Like all really Old English Ballads, it was of
an almost interminable length; but we shall only insert a few verses.
It was a most appropriate ditty (the locality considered), for the words
were as follow:-
 </p><p>   The first verse was chanted by little Anne, and began-
</p><p>

  </p><p>  " Then she must have been uncommonly heavy," observed Master
Hewet, who was beginning to get a little tired of the concert, and was

about to state so, when Horton joined in, laying a strong emphasis upon
the word "' we," as he looked at Sir Filbut:-</p><p>

</p><p>
  Here Hewet gave a very loud snore, which proved that although. not
'with a gay La-dee," the man had fallen fast asleep. At this Flora
sang, at the very top of her voice-

</quote>
 </p><p>   "What's that--what's that !" exclaimed Hewet, waking up with a
start; and then, like a man who is suddenly called from his sleep to
fulfil some important duty, he hurriedly bawled out-

  "And, damn 'em-thrash 'em     both within an inch of their lives !"
We beg to apologise for swearing, but it was a very common habit in
the sixteenth century. Even Queen Elizabeth was not exempt from
that vice of the day, so we hope, as faithful chroniclers, to be pardoned.
  </p><p>  "Good Heavens!" exclaimed Alyce, " what ails you ?" She was really
alarmed, for Master Hewet still stood in the centre of the room quite
bewildered
  </p><p>  " A thousand pardons, my dear Alyce," at last he said; " but I must
have been dreaming; I've had such horrid visions flying through my
brain, and mixing themselves up with that silly song.  I'm afraid I've
made myself more silly than the song itself."
  </p><p>   The party now broke up, and each went their way.
  </p><p>   Sir Filbut, as may be supposed, was in ecstacy at the progress he was
sure he had made in the good graces of that queen of every grace, fair
Alyce Hewet.
  </p><p>  "Could   any man on earth," he said, as he strolled homewards,
"having so few opportunities of making himself agreeable to the fair, as
he hitherto had had with Alyce, have done so much, in so little time,
as he ? No !" he exclaimed, proudly, as if there could be any cause for
pride, in succeeding in any act of villany. " She has kept my diamond-
how beautiful it looked on her fair neck ! she has kept my lute-how
lovely it will sound beneath her fair hand!  And she has kept my
golden fork---"   Here he stopped, for he could not bring his mind to feel

 how lovely it would look as an ornament to her fair hair; not but at
 that moment he thought her so right in everything, that had she told
 him to stick it through his own nose, and wear it there for her sake, we
 verily believe he would have done so.
 As he passed beneath the Traitor's Gate. he started; for a voice, as if
 issuing from the very stones of the wall, sang pointedly, but oh! so
 sweetly-</p><p>

</p><p>
    Ha, ha ! oh, oh ! he, he - !" screeched out the Cripple of the
  Bridge-gate Tower, for it was he who had thrust his misshapen head
out through a little window in the wall, close to Sir Filbut's ear, and
  had thus startled him.
</p><p>      " Why, Willy," said Sir Filbut, " you are like a ghost; at every
  turn you haunt one.   Why are you not up amongst your darling
  traitors ?"
</p><p>      "Because," replied the other, " I have a spike to spare, and came
  down to look for one darling traitor more."
  </p><p>    " And have you found one ?" asked Sir Filbut, laughing.
  </p><p>    " Perhaps you can tell me," was the Cripple's reply.
  </p><p>    "If you mean me, certainly not. I'm too loyal ever to war against
  my King."
   </p><p>   "Oh! there are other traitors," replied the Cripple, "than those
  who compass a king's death; for instance, he who secretly wars against
a man's good name-he is a traitor! and he who wars against a maid's
good fame-he is a traitor! and  -"
  </p><p>    "Enough, good Cripple, say no more ; you're far too quick for me to
  argue with.  But I marvel not at your wisdom, seeing how many wise
heads you always have at your command."
   </p><p>   "Mind I do not place a fool's amongst them, by way of variety,"
  said the Cripple, as he slammed to the casement.
   </p><p>   Sir Filbut could not help laughing at the Cripple's retort, and having
  called out to him a loud " good night," continued his way towards his
  home. The Cripple was heard repeating the verse he had just sung,
  but now he altered the last line; for he said-</p><p>

</p><p>  THE reader will doubtless remember that at the close of the third
chapter we described the manner in which the Blear-eyed Bully, with
his two assistant murderers, had disposed of the unfortunate weaver and
Edward Osborne.   This happened in the night preceding the day on
which the robber Miles was to be tried for his life. During the whole
of that evening Master Hewet had felt so much anxiety concerning the
non-appearance of Edward, that he could no longer resist telling his wife
and Harry Horton the course he had pursued to ensure the safety of his
apprentice.  " Alas !" he said, "I fear I have fallen into a deep-laid
snare, and have perchance become the innocent cause of some dreadful
misfortune to the youth. Why was I in such haste to follow the advice
of any anonymous informer?  I believe that both the letters -
 </p><p>   " Both the letters !" exclaimed Horton, taken off his guard.
  </p><p>  "Yes, two letters reached me; but I have every reason to believe
that the second was forwarded merely to raise my confidence in the
advice offered in the first; for in that I was told another would be placed
within my reach, and so there was, and exactly in the manner described."
 </p><p>   Horton was now taken completely aback.    Could the Blear-eyed
Bully have betrayed him ?  But why should he ?  He was the only
one to whom Horton had divulged his scheme; but, then, the Bully's
safety was as much at stake as his own.
 </p><p>   Dame Alyce, to whom all this seemed like a romance, became greatly
interested; for she, equally with the merchant, felt convinced that there
was a plot laid, either for good or ill, so asked her husband a thousand
questions, every one of which Horton himself would have liked to have
put, but felt he dared not. How anxiously did he list to every word
the merchant uttered in answer to Alyce's inquiries, hoping therefrom to
find some clue to the mystery.
  </p><p>   It appeared, that not an hour after the dead of night, the merchant
was disturbed by a strange noise at the window of the room next to his
dormitory, looking on to the bridge; indeed, it was the same casement
at which they had stood the day before to witness the procession of the
Maypole.  As this noise, a sort of tapping, continued, the merchant at
last arose to learn the cause; and on looking out, he saw a boy beneath,
who, the moment the casement opened, raised on the end of a long
willow wand a letter, which the merchant having taken, the boy ran
swiftly away towards the City. So truthfully was this letter written,
that Master Hewet acted upon its advice immediately, and sent off Edward in the manner the reader is already aware of. The merchant, on
descending in the morning, found Horton's letter forced under the outer
door; he had placed it there only a few minutes after Osborne had departed.


                             <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>

  The merchant said, that although the finding the second letter
 confirmed, in some degree, the truth of the first, yet it had perplexed
 him much, for it proposed a place of safety directly opposite to that in
 which he had placed Edward.  "But," he continued, " whatever misfortune, if any has happened, must have occurred this day; for he
 was safe with my old friend at Putney as late as yesterday; this I
 know."
  </p><p>   " And is safe, yet, you may depend," said Alyce. " He knows full
 well the hour he will be wanted, and, no doubt, will be at Westminster
 to-morrow, by the time you reach the court. You know how pressing
 Walter Cromwell is to all who visit him; and to that over-kindness
 you may, believe me, attribute this delay. But Osborne ever was a
 thoughtless boy, and, doubtless, was glad of any plea to spend another
 day of idleness; for, as the saintly father Brassinjaw has often said--"
  </p><p>   Yes, yes, my dear, I know, I know exactly what the saintly
Father has often said," observed the merchant, "so let us retire to rest,
for the thought of that man always makes me feel sleepy, without even
hearing what he says."
 </p><p>   "Oh, husband, I'm shocked ! but, yet, I hope we both may live to
see the day that you will think as highly of that saintly creature
as I do."
 </p><p>   I hope, with all my soul, we may," replied the merchant, "for
then we shall never die !"
</p><p>    This was far too shocking to be replied to, so Alyce took up the lamp,
and shaking her head sadly, left the room, followed by her husband.
 </p><p>   Horton went to his chamber, but it was useless to attempt sleep: he
was bewildered quite.  He said he must have been a fool not to have
thought of Cromwell's; but how could he have guessed that any one
could have proposed that place-and how could any one have learnt
his plans. It was too late, now, to start for Putney, and he had,
unfortunately, no appointment with the Bully until after the trial;
but, still, so anxious and restless did he feel, that he determined to visit
the " Cardinal's hat," thinking it might, by some chance, so happen
that his murderous friend should be there upon other affairs.
</p><p>    We have already stated, that after the murder, the three wretches took
their way towards the Bridge, so, that, by mere accident, it did turn out
exactly as Horton had hoped; for, soon after he had entered, these
blood-stained worthies also came in.
 </p><p>   Horton was upon the point of telling the Bully all he had that night
learnt; but was silenced, and made almost to sink with fear, as the
Blear-eyed Bully whispered in his ear the horrors they had just committed.
--" Here, milksop !" he said, pushing a jug of hot liquor towards Horton, who had turned deadly pale, " take some of this spirit, for you have
but little of your own, and then go home to bed-that's the best place
for boys: sleep off your fears, and, in the morning, when we meet in the
court, look well at me, and learn the proper bearing of a man."
 </p><p>   We will not attempt to follow the workings of Horton's mind during
the dark hours of that night.  At every turn he fancied lie saw the
weaver and Osborne bleeding at his bedside; and waking, found himself continually crying out, that it was not he who had murdered them.







<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>

The moment it was light, he arose, and bathing his head and face again
and again in cold water, he tried to shake off his fears, and to a degree
succeeded. He felt, that although the crime had been committed, no
one could accuse him; and now, both the witnesses against Miles being
gone, the robber would doubtless put on a more courageous bearing, and
keep his tongue between his teeth. What seemed to relieve Horton's
mind most effectually, was a virtuous determination he had formed, in
the darkness of the night, that, should he but escape the present danger,
henceforth he would enter upon a better course.  Poor youth! he had
yet to learn, how seldom are the good intentions formed in darkness,
ever allowed to live through the light of even a single day.
 </p><p>   When the time for departure of the merchant, and those who were
to attend the court, had arrived, Sir Filbut Fussy, who had now become
a frequent visitor at the house of merchant Hewet, made his appearance.
He was mounted on a beautiful horse, and followed by a number of
others, led by his men, bearing upon their left arms his badge of
servitude. Alyce, having expressed a wish to hear the trial, it had
been settled, at the earnest solicitation of Sir Filbut, that the whole
party should go by land, instead of by water, as was the usual method,
and that he should be allowed the honour of supplying the horses from
his own stables. Another reason Sir Filbut offered for proposing this
arrangement, was, his desire to have the advice of the merchant, regarding an open plot of ground lying in the Strand, which he had a wish
to purchase for the purpose of erecting a mansion upon it.-" This they
could," he said, " examine on their way to Westminster; and he
should, by the present arrangement, have the advantage of consulting
the exquisite taste of the merchant's wife."
 </p><p>   A splendid charger had been provided for Master Hewet, with a pillion
behind for the accommodation of his fair spouse. A mule was placed at
the disposal of Horton, and another, upon  hich was a kind of double
leathern chair, very like those used in the present day for children,
when they ride in pairs upon donkeys in the park-this was for the
use of Flora Gray and the little Anne, for Dame Hewet seldom took
pleasure away from home, where she could not be accompanied by her
handmaiden and her darling child. After all were mounted, there still
remained one mule without a rider; this had been provided for Osborne,
for up to the last moment, they still expected his arrival.  When all
was ready, two running footmen took the lead, two more, one on each
side the head of the horse, which bore the merchant and his wife,
attended by Sir Filbut Fussy, then came Flora with the little Anne,
and at her side, the worthless, but by her admired, Harry Horton.
The rear was brought up by several mounted serving-men, all in the
livery of Sir Filbut Fussy.
  </p><p>  The narrowness of the bridge, rendered it incumbent on those who
met the cavalcade, occasionally to vanish into the shop door-ways, or
to stand aside, in the open spaces looking upon the waters. Here and
there, the houses approached so close together, that only one rider could
pass comfortably along without endangering the pedestrians, whom they
should chance to meet.
 </p><p>   Just before quitting the Bridge, when in one of the narrowest parts







                         ,                         <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

  the merchant's horse, from some cause or other, shied, and had nearly
  done great harm to a passer-by, who, striking the horse across the head
  with his staff, exclaimed-" Curses on ye, upstarts! What, oh ! brother Hewet, is it thou ?  Ha, ha! ho, ho! he, he-- ! But I shall boil
  your head yet! I shall boil your head yet !"
  </p><p>    "Out of the way, Cripple!" said Horton, savagely striking at him
  with a heavy whip, which the Cripple parried with his staff, and merely
  uttering a contemptuous " Pish !" hobbled on towards the Bridge-gate
  Tower, humming, as he went-</p><p>
                  <quote rend="blockquote"><l>     "We must set a man to watch,

            When the party quitted the Bridge, they turned to the left, and
  passed along Thames Street, then one of the best Streets, but still very
  straggling in its form. By-and-by they turned up Paul's Chain, into
  Paul's Church Yard, and thence quitting the City by the Ludgate,
  descended Ludgate Hill, then called Fleete Hyll; passed over Fleete
  Bridge, for, at the time we speak of, the River Thames received a
  smaller river, where Blackfriars Bridge now stands, which river was
  called the River of Fleete; it was broad and deep, and was of great
  use for merchant-vessels.  This river afterwards became partially filled
  up, and then bore the less ostentatious appellation of Fleet Ditch.
  Many years elapsed, and it was covered in, and now what remains of
  it is hid beneath Bridge Street, and that magnificent opening, Farringdon
  Street, at the extremity of which, formerly stood another bridge, crossing the same River of Fleete, called Oldbourn, or Holborn Bridge.
    An observation, which fell from the lips of merchant Hewet, as they
  crossed Fleete Bridge, clearly shews that, at that early period of his
  career, he must, as we have before stated, have been a merchant well to
  do, for he said, answering a question of his wife-" No, love, not on the
  left, but yonder, to the right; the whole of that range of vessels, which,
  even you, a female, may perceive, are better appointed than the rest,
  those are the vessels belonging to your adoring husband, William
  Hewet."
  </p><p>    A little beyond Temple Bar, the noble horse upon which the
 merchant rode, and which had previously, more than once, shewn a
 restive disposition, became almost unmanageable, and Alyce was so
 alarmed, that she dared not, she said, remain upon so fiery a steed;
 but Sir Filbut Fussy declared, that this horse was the one he always
 rode, and was mildness itself when he was upon its back; as a proof of
 the soothness of his words, he begged the merchant to alight, and change
horses. This the merchant did, and Sir Filbut, having placed himself
before the lovely Alyce, and having begged of her to hold fast by him,
and fear nothing, made the animal go through his various paces with all
the docility of a lamb. Sir Filbut's spirits now rose to an amazing
height, for he had, at last, brought about what he had expected long
before; but he had miscalculated the good horsemanship of our city
merchant. The truth was, that Sir Filbut's charger was so well schooled
to the peculinar manage of his master, that, hitherto, few had ever been







<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>

able to keep their seats but himself; and it had annoyed him terribly,
to find that Hewet knew so well the temper of a horse, as to be able, thus
long, to keep him in control.
 </p><p>   They had now reached the Strand, at that time a very ill-formed road,
for it was but three years before that the real line of way could be
said to have been fairly marked out; before that, it is true, the land
traffic, the little which took place, passed this way from the City of
London to that of Westminster, the principal conveyance, both of
merchandize as well as of passengers, being that of boats. As a proof
of the enormous importance the Thames then enjoyed, it is said, that no
less than forty thousand watermen were at one time enrolled upon the
lists of their fraternity.
 </p><p>   The new road, for it might be called new at the time we speak of,
having, as we have just said, but been completed three years before,
namely, <date value="1533">1533</date>, was scarcely used but to approach the northern entrances
of the grounds belonging to the various noble mansions built some distance
from the Strand, and overlooking the bright and busy Thames. From
all the gardens belonging to these mansions, houses, and castles of the
great, there was, from each, a " stair," or, as frequently called, a
" bridge" by our modern writers, who seem to regard the terms as
synonymous; but, upon this point, we must be allowed to differ. The
stairs" were, as their name implies, merely steps leading down to
the water; but the " bridge," as the " Queen's Bridge," "Privy
Bridge," and others, were well-built structures, erected for the purpose of commodious embarkation, and at the end of which were steps,
also descending to the water, to be used when the tide was low; but the
main portion was literally a bridge, extending, in many cases, far into
the river, and built upon several arches.
  </p><p>  The whole of the north side of the Strand, at this time, was open
country, and it was here that Sir Filbut pointed out a spot of ground,
not far from where the Adelphi Theatre now stands, as the site of his
new mansion.   He said-" I shall build a tower high enough to overlook all the fields yonder; the Convent Garden (now Covent Garden
Market), the little village of St. Giles, and, indeed, far beyond." The
merchant pronounced it to be an admirably-formed conceit; and Alyce
admired the locality as being " so superbly open."
 </p><p>   It now seems almost beyond our belief, when casting an eye up any
of the several courts, to imagine that that spot could have ever been
pronounced as " superbly open;" yet so it then was; and even thirty
years later, we find but a single row of dwellings along that line, and
all beyond green open country.
</p><p>    The party soon after arrived at the court of justice. Sir Filbut
Fussy, with Alyce and her maiden, obtained accommodation in the
gallery above, while Hewet and Horton hurried about, in vain endeavour,
to find Edward Osborne and the other witness, Wallace the weaver.
Horton was not yet so inured to crime, as to be able to hear, with composure, even the names of those whose dreadful fates he knew full well.
Horton had another reason for his present seeming activity in his
master's cause, and that was, the hope of learning from the Bully, if
possible, how Miles was likely to act, now there was every chance, nay,








                         .                          <pb id="p.51" n="51"/>

a certainty, of his acquittal. His mind was set completely at rest, when
at last he encountered this worthy, for he assured Horton, that Miles
  was " staunch to the backbone, now there could be no danger; but
  he's a cowardly cur," he said; "and lucky it is for us that they are
  both dead, or we should have swung for it, as sure as we have necks to
  hang by. But, hark! they are calling on the cause."  They entered
  the court by different ways, just as Miles was put to the bar.
  </p><p>    The merchant had proposed to his man of law to throw up the case,
  and let Miles be discharged at once; but the man of law, having prepared a most eloquent speech, not feeling inclined that the world should
  lose so great a treasure, insisted upon going on at all events, until they
  had to call their witnesses-" For," as he said, "it is not impossible
  that both Osborne, as well as Wallace, may yet arrive." Every time
  he came to the words, " which we shall be able to prove by our witnesses," Horton saw a sneer of contempt and triumph pass across the
  features of the Bully. At last, the counsel having exhausted all his
  beauties of speech, as well as his breath, sat down; and the crier called
  upon Edward Osborne to come into court; but no Edward Osborne
  answered: this having been done three times, the opposing counsel was
  heard to say, in an undertone of voice, but quite loud enough to reach
  every ear--" Exactly what I expected, exactly what I expected." Then
  came great nodding of heads together, and smiles, and a whispered
  witticism or two at the expense of brother Whistlepipe, Master Hewet's
  leading counsel. Then the crier called three times upon the next witness, Wallace, the weaver, to appear, but with no better result than in
  the case of Osborne. Upon this second failure, up started Sergeant Thunderdown, brimful of that virtuous indignation which counsel can at all
  times call up from the very bottom of their too sensitive hearts. He
  said-" The insult to the Court was almost too great to be borne, and
  were it not for the respect he felt for the learned judge before him, he
  should be tempted to tell his learned brother, Whistlepipe-- but, no,
  no; he would, for this time, swallow the gall of his indignation, and
  stifle in its birth the child of his resentment. Besides," he said, "there
  was another reason for his determination to say but little, and that was,
  his wish to ease the feelings of that poor innocent creature there," (here
  he pointed to the prisoner, who really appeared to be the very impersonation of villany), " look at his face-there you will see the very index
  of a book of innocence, that a babe might read with advantage."  He
  appealed to the judge, he appealed to the jury, he appealed to all who
  heard him-had there ever been such a trumpery, such a contemptible,
  such an insulting case, as the one now brought before them ? Here was
  a poor, worthy, hard-working, honest, religious creature, accused of
  robbery, kept in prison for weeks and months--he was going to say
  years, for every week in prison, to the innocent, is as a year-he is
  to be tried for his life, and when it comes to the proof, the witnesses dare
  not look innocence in the face, and therefore abscond-yes, abscond!
  Now, although his injured client must of necessity be acquitted, yet, to
shew the world how worthy a man had been placed in that dreadful
position, he would call one, only one, although he had a hundred witnesses ready to speak to character. He called Captain Bully.








<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>                    .

</p><p>    Horton rose up actually with astonishment when he saw the Blear-
 eyed Bully most unconcernedly take his place in the witness-box. Had
 but one hundredth part of what Captain Bully said been true, Miles
 would have been one of the most celestial beings heaven had ever permitted to visit this earth-there was not a virtue of man, woman, or
 child, that Miles did not possess, at least, so said the noble Captain.
 The Bully became so warmed by his subject, so enthusiastic in his eule
 giums, so eloquent in his praises, that Miles actually blushed at hearing
 himself thus painted in all the colours of the purest virtue, religion,
 equity, and honour ! There is scarcely any knowing how long the Bully
 would have continued, had not he been stopped suddenly, just as he was
 calling upon Heaven to send, if such an one could be found, a single
 human being, who would dare to accuse his innocent friend. He had
 just finished this sentence, when a cry was raised by those without, or
 " He's here! he's here !" followed by loud shouts; in another moment,
 a party of Hewet's workmen hurried in, bringing with them Edward
 Osborne.
 </p><p>    Had a ghost really appeared, the effect could have been but little
greater upon the prisoner and the witness. Miles became deadly pale,
his teeth chattered in his head, and he had nearly fallen to the ground;
the Blear-eyed Bully stood aghast, but being a man of iron nerves,
suddenly recovered his self-possession, and immediately attempted
unseen to leave the court.
  </p><p>   " Remain !" exclaimed the Judge, who had observed the intention of
the Bully.  The crowd that stood around the witness-box forced him
back again, and then came forth all the wretch's reckless audacity. He
in a loud voice addressed the Judge, saying-" My Lord, why am I de
tained ?  I have given my evidence. I am a witness, not a prisoner!"
 </p><p>  " Oh, God ! that voice !" exclaimed Edward, who, turning saw the
Bully; " that form-it is-it is the murderer !"
  </p><p>   As may be supposed, this sudden accusation caused an immense sensation in the Court. Edward was called upon to explain his meaning, and
listened to with breathless attention, as he related all that he had witnessed the night before. As he proceeded in his narrative, at every step
the interest became more and more intense; and a shudder ran through
the whole court, as he described the death-struggle of the victim with
nis murderer; every eye was fixed on the Blear-eyed Bully, as Edward
pointing to him, exclaimed, " and as God shall prove my words, that
man is the murderer !"
  </p><p>  There was little doubt now, that if what Osborne had stated were true,
the murdered man was the unfortunate weaver.  The Bully was placed
in the dock with Miles, and called upon to answer, if he could, the accusation against him.
 </p><p>   As he took his place by Miles, he looked down upon him  with a
withering sneer of utter contempt, for Miles was almost sinking from intense agitation.  Harry Horton was scarcely less alarmed, and kept his
eyes rivetted imploringly upon the Bully, who said in a deep under
tone, "I am no blab !" Horton felt his meaning, and for a moment.
breathed more freely.
  </p><p>  " See, see," said Osborne, again pointing to the accused, " I had forgotten







                                                  <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>

  to say, that as the body, to the feet of which a huge stone was
  tied, fell heavily from the boat, the murdered victim had seized so
  tightly upon his assassin, that in sinking down, he bore with him a
  portion of the murderer's coat, to which he had clung; and see, the jerkin
  of that man is rent, and part is torn away."
    </p><p>   " Ha, ha, a pretty witness this to swear a man's life away !" exclaimed the Bully, " who first examines a poor devil's clothes, and because
  they are not so prim and new as his own, turns one's poverty to account,
  and -"
   </p><p>    Here he was interrupted by Miles, who no longer able to bear his
  mental suffering, cried out--" Mercy, mercy ! only save my life, and I will
  tell all  "
    </p><p>   "Silence !" roared out the Blear-eyed Bully.  At the same time
  Harry Horton rose, knowing not what he did.
    </p><p>   "I will not be silent!" said the other; "only promise me my life--
  only promise me my life-and I will tell all: there are more here who
  know- "
    </p><p>   "Silence, hell-dog !" exclaimed the Bully, foaming with rage.
   </p><p>    ' I will speak, I will speak--"
   </p><p>    "Then damn you !" he cried, in a voice of thunder; and with a giant's
  power gave the poor wretch such a deadly blow upon the temple with
  his clenched fist, that the blood flew about in all directions, and Miles
  lay dead at his feet.
    </p><p>   But this was not yet the climax of the horrid scene; shouts of
  execration were heard, the large doors opposite to where the prisoner stood suddenly flew  open, and there was seen a crowd,
  headed by the Bridge-shooter, bearing in the dead body of the
  murdered weaver, in whose hand was still clenched the damning
  evidence against his assassin. The Blear-eyed Bully's whole face
  swelled up until scarcely a feature could be distinguished; his eyes
  seemed bursting from  their sockets; the women screamed; Alyce
  fainted; and the whole court became a scene of fright, bewilderment,
  confusion and of horror.

 </p><p>   ALYCE being too indisposed to ride home, Sir Filbut Fussy flew to
  the Palace Stairs, and hired one of the most commodious barges there
  in this she was placed, supported by cushions, and sat reclining between
  her husband and Sir Filbut: on one side of the boat was Flora Gray,
  on the other little Anne, with her favourite, Edward Osborne, and in
  the centre, but at a respectful distance, Billy-the-bridge-shooter was
seated on the floor, for Edward had already acquainted the good
merchant with quite enough of the late strange occurrences to raise
  his curiosity, and create a desire to know more. They had searched in
  vain for Harry Horton-he had left the court unseen, immediately after







     <pb id="p.54" n="54"/>           .

the murderer had been committed. They felt no alarm on his account,
for just as the merchant was placing his foot upon the barge, an ill-
looking fellow handed him a letter; this was from Horton, excusing his
absence, under the plea of having been sent for, to attend, wha , he said
he feared, would prove the death-bed of his beloved father.  Not one
word of this was truth; but he found himself in such a state of fear for
his own safety, which now rested upon the breath of the Blear-eyed
Bully, that it was impossible he could endure the restraint, under
which he would be compelled to keep his dreadful anxiety, were he
beneath his master's roof.  The letter could scarcely be read, from
the trembling of his hand, which Alyce attributed to "that good young
man's over-wrought filial anxiety."
 </p><p>   As may be supposed, they had scarcely been seated before the wonderful scene they had just left became the all-absorbing topic of conversation, and now Edward explained those parts in which he was concerned, and which he had omitted when in court, as being useless at
that time.
  </p><p>  " But to what miracle," said the merchant, " did you owe the preservation of your own life ?"
 </p><p>   "To that miracle !" replied Edward, pointing and looking kindly at
Billy-the-bridge-shooter; 'it is to him I owe my life, through God's
help, and to him alone!" he seized the lad's hand and shook it heartily;
" would that I knew how to thank him enough !"
 </p><p>   " Kiss him," said the child; "that's the way you always thank me
when I please you."
 </p><p>   " But perhaps, Anne," said the merchant, smiling at the child's
innocence, "but perhaps he would prefer being thanked by some fine
lady-will Flora, perchance--'"
 </p><p>   "Indeed, master, but Flora won't," said the maid, tossing up her
nose.
 </p><p>   " Then I will," and throwing her arms round the lad's neck, the child
kissed the Bridge-shooter, whose face became scarlet with confusion.  A
hearty laugh was sent forth at his expense, as he said, " Thank'y, my
lady, but vot I a' done for him an't worth half of that-it an't indeed,
my lady; he was kind to my poor old mother, you sees, my lady; and I
teached him to svim-I only teached him to svim-that's all-and I
hope my lord and my lady, and you, honord sir, I an't done no harm; if I
has, I humbly craves your pardon." Having said this he looked all manner
of ways, he felt so terribly ashamed. Edward to relieve him of his embarrassment, drew all the attention towards himself, by explaining how (having, by the able instruction of his humble friend, become a most able
and expert swimmer, since he had left his master's home), he had been
enabled to baffle the murderous intention of his assailants the night
before. It appeared, fortunately for himself, his presence of mind never
for a moment forsook him, notwithstanding the danger he was in, and
the agitation caused by witnessing the dreadful murder. The moment
he was precipitated into the water, he felt that were he again to be seen
by those wretches, his death was certain, so calculating (which proved to
be exactly the case), that as the stream was running swiftly down, they








                       ,                          <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>

 would naturally first watch in that direction, in order to complete his
 destruction should he again appear, he, whilst under the water, laboured
 to swim for a time against the stream, and remembering that he had
 see a single barge at some distance off, he turned his course, as well as
 he could guess, in that direction; fortune befriended him, for when
 compelled again to come to the surface to take breath, he perceived
 himself to be just on the further side of it; this for a time screened him
 from their view, but fancying they were turning their boat to that point,
 he once again dived under, and coming up as seldom as his now-failing
 strength would permit, he at last gained the shore. So completely worn
 out was he, that he found it impossible to rise from the ground upon
 which he now lay. The night had become bitter cold-his senses
 were gradually leaving him-strange fancies flitted through his brain
 --he felt that he was dying-when, just as his eyes were closing, and
 he had given up all hopes of life, he felt a hand placed upon his
 shoulder. The sudden thought that the murderers had seized him, gave
 him for a moment the strength of despair; he turned, when over him
 he saw, by the moon's light, the kneeling figure of an aged woman.
 " Come," she said, " come, I am sent to fetch you. Ha, ha ! my son
 will own I'm a witch now, I'm thinking: were I not a witch, how had
 I known you were here. Whoever you may be rise and follow me; but
 first take this-it is a magic draught that always gives me strength."
 She placed to his lips an antique wooden bottle, curiously carved; the
 spirit it contained acted powerfully upon his frame, it glowed like fire
 through his veins. The old woman again urging him to follow her, he
 made another effort to rise, which, by her aid, proved successful. In a
 few minutes they reached a hut of the humblest kind; it stood alone in
 the midst of the marshes near Lambeth, then a bleak and desolate spot;
 but his heart was cheered by the sight of a blazing fire, and his wonder
 raised to the highest pitch, for there by its welcome light he saw the
 Bridge-shooter comfortably seated.
</p><p>  " But I was more astonished nor him," said the lad, " to see Master
 Edward walk in with my old mother. But don't believe, good gentle
 folks, that she is a vitch-she isn't-indeed she isn't; although she
 does at times make vun doubt vun's seven senses."
  </p><p>   Edward soon concluded his narrative, by stating that, completely overcome with fatigue, horror, and anxiety, it was useless to attempt reaching
the merchant's that night, and it was late in the morning before a boat
could be procured. The Bridge-shooter had not accompanied him, for
he said he had a little secret business of his own to perform that morning, but hurried Edward away straight to the Court. Of all that subsequently happened there, the reader is fully aware. Alyce and Flora
had been so interested in Edward as he told his tale of wonder, that
they began to regard him with a very different feeling to that which
they had experienced towards the poor youth on May-day, at Mary
Overies' Green.  Billy-the-bridge-shooter now became the centre of
attraction to all the party, as he took up the thread of the discourse,
saying-" Indeed, I vos astonished to see Master Edward come in vith
my mother! And didn't she rate me soundly for my disbelief of her
being a vitch ?  ' What,' said she, ven Master Edward vos asleep, and







<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>                    .

we were a votching on him-' what,' said she, 'should have told me all
that has come to pass, if I am not a witch ? Is it nothing, think you,
that three several times to-night a coal should have flown out of the
fire, and every time of a different shape ?' ' It vould a been much more
vunderful, mother,' said I, ' if their shapes had a been all alike.'  Then
she vent on-' The first was like a coffin, and so fairly made, that I
knew it was for speedy use; that spoke of coming death-and has not
a man been murdered?   The next was like but half a coffin; a death
but half performed-and has not Master Edward, as you call him, been
within an inch of death? The last that came, was like a large full
purse !'-' Vell, mother,' said I, ' that's not comed at all events.' ' But
it will, boy-it will,' she replied: and I vish it may---"
  </p><p>  "And so it shall," interrupted Master Hewet; " but, proceed."
 </p><p>   "There, now, I think you thinks I thinks about the money," said
the lad, " and that's vot made me tell you vot mother said; but I
doesn't-indeed I doesn't! Vell, ven Master Edward vos fairly off,
says I to mother, 'to prove a murder, you vonts a vitness; now, there
can't be no vitness half so good of a man's being murdered, as to make
a vitness out o' the man himself. Mother agreed vith vot I said, for
she's clever at times; so off I started to the vorter. Scaley Bill, the salmon
fisher, was close in ashore. I told him all about it, and off we pushed to
the spot Master Edward had pointed out: down I dives, and there,
sure enough, I found the body-it was bolt upright, as if trying
to rise to tell the world of the misdeed.  I'm not afraid of dead men
-not I, nor much of living vuns neither; so I undid the stone that
vos fastened by a slipknot round his legs, and vith my horrid load,
swam to the light o' day. Scaley Bill vos monstrous frightened ven
he saw me come up, and crossed himself, I don't know how many times,
and said I don't know how many prayers, afore he'd let me get into the
boat.  Lots of other boats now came about; ve soon landed-and all
the rest your honors knows."
</p><p>    " But," enquired Edward, who possessed, as all else did in those
days, a degree of superstition, " but, if your mother were not a witch,
how came she to find me at that hour of the night, and in such a place ?
and what did she mean by saying she was sent to fetch me ?"
 </p><p>  " I axed that myself," said the lad; " and she said-' Do you think
it's nothing,' for she generally begins her clevernesses by asking if it's
nothing-and it very often is--' do you think it's nothing to see a
spider creeping, and creeping, from under your petticoats---"
  </p><p>  " Ah !" screamed Flora, at the same time catching up her own all
round her legs, and shewing a very pretty little pair of ankles, as though
one had been creeping, and creeping, from under her own; then blushing
at her fears, she carefully covered her feet, and the lad went on.
 </p><p>   " I watched it,' said mother, 'all across the floor, and it went on, and
on, until it came to some water I had spilt, and there it stopped; by
that I knew it was at the water's brink, that what I was to find would
no where else be found: so off I trudged, and didn't I find the youth;
and now, silly boy, will you still say I'm not a witch!' I know mother'll
be burnt, 1 know she will; I keeps her in the marshes out of the way, on
purpose that no one may hear her nonsense."







                                             <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>

      All the party agreed, however, that it was very strange, a very wonderful
        coincidence, a very extraordinary agreeing of facts, &amp;c. &amp;c. ; but
 everybody laughed at the idea of believing in witchcraft, yet, inwardly
 every soul there determined privately to pay a visit to the witch of the
 marshes.  No other incident occurred until they arrived at the merchant's, excepting that Billy-the-bridge-shooter, at his most earnest
 entreaty, was allowed to shoot the boat through Old London Bridge,
 instead of landing the party at the Swan stairs, and this he did in so masterly a manner, that all allowed the honourable name he bore was most
 meritoriously bestowed. Sir Filbut placed a piece of gold in his hand,
 and desired to know the address of his mother in the marshes, as he
 might, perchance, pay her a visit of charity.  As the lad described the
 spot, not only were Flora's ears strained wide open to catch every word,
 but also those of the lovely Alyce; and it must be owned that Master
 Hewet, too, made up his mind not to forget the direction of the cunning
 woman of the marsh.</p><p>
 Such horrible murders as that of the weaver on the river, and of
 Miles in the open court, combined with the strange, nay, almost miraculous, discovery of the perpetrator, naturally became the topic of universal conversation. Every running newsman reaped a plentiful harvest,
 by retailing all the most minute particulars of how deep the wound was
 in the weaver's head--and how far the blood of Miles had flown, and
 how tne greater part of it had spirted right over Harry Horton, Master
 Hewet's apprentice.  " Indeed, but it did," said the newsman of the
 Cardinal's Hat; " I ought to know, for I was there, I imagine."  Now
 he, like all his fraternity, was sure to have been at every scene he
 described, although fifty might have been going on at once, in fifty
 different places.-" Indeed, but it did, and it took such an effect on
Master Horton, that he's gone home ill to his father's."--" But who
is the murderer ?" said Checklocke the smith, for this dialogue took place
in the upper, or more respectable room of the wine house, and was now
filled by the traders and smaller merchants of the Bridge.  " Oh!
replied the newsman, knowing his business too well to injure the respectability of the Cardinal's Hat, by owning he had seen him there,
"oh; a fellow from some distant part-no one seems to know him further
than that they call him the Blear-eyed Bully; he's as tough as iron, for
when he was put to the rack he only laughed, and told them  'to save
their trouble, for that they might tear his flesh into a hundred mouths,
but all the racks the fiends could muster, should not put a tongue into
one of them; and he has kept his word; although it is well known he
had accomplices, he has not betrayed a single name."
   </p><p>   " No, nor will he," said saintly father Brassinjaw, who now looked
 smug and trim, and it being midday, was perfectly sober, and was now
 drinking a little sweetened water; " no, they will wring nothing from
 him. I have visited him night and day, at the intercession of that
 good young man, Harry Horton, who, although too ill himself to come
 to his master's, has not forgotten the spiritual welfare of that poor lost
 creature."
  </p><p>   In part this was true, for Horton had employed his friend the priest
 to act as the go-between for him to the Bully, who laughed at Horton's

fears, and sent him word to " Come to his execution, and see how a man
could die."
 </p><p>   " But what other news have you, good Master Knowy ?" inquired
Catchemayde; " how goes on the trial of the Queen ?"
 </p><p>   " Oh, her affair's so stale, it's scarcely worth the mentioning; but it
will be a rather pretty execution on the 17th, when her five lovers are
to die: Smeaton's to be hanged-the others lose their heads.  That's
all well enough; but it is vastly like playing with the people's patience,
methinks-first to give out that we were to have a bonfire, made of a
real right arnest Queen, and then, forsooth, to be put off in this way,
with a mere slash-my-neck-and-it's-all-over."
  </p><p>  " What !" said Silkworm the stringer; " is she only to have her head
cut off, after all ? then I shall not take the trouble to go and see it, I
can tell 'em."
  </p><p>  " Nor shall I," added Checklocke.
</p><p>    " And I'm sure I won't !" chimed in Catchemayde.
 </p><p>   " And I'm sure," said the newsman, " you're all right if you don't go,
for you wouldn't s e it if you did. Why, bless you ! so tender-hearted
is our good, dear, sweet King Harry, that not only has he refused to lot
her be burnt to death, for he was to do as he liked with her-which, by
the by, he generally does with most people; but in case she might be
put to the blush, sweet innocent, by honest folks looking at her, it's all
to be done within the walls of the Tower, and nobody is to know the
time: but I know the day-mum, the 19th-but keep that snug; and
now listen to this, my masters-if this isn't a bit of favouritism, I don't
know what is. Why, bless you, so afraid is the King that his dear
Nanny should be hurt, that he has sent all the way to Calais for the
French headsman.  To be sure, we all know that mounseer's a pretty
workman, a very pretty workman; and I believe it's a fact, that no
one whose head he has once cut off has ever after been heard to complain
of his method."
 </p><p>   "No !" exclaimed all present.
  </p><p>  " Never! at least I've heard so, and that's saying a great deal for
one who has had it in his power to hurt the feelings of so many."
 </p><p>   Here the saintly father Brassinjaw, giving the newsman a sly wink,
and beckoning him forward, whispered into his ear-" Good Master
Knowy, canst thou not, in all thy budget, scrape up a little morsel of-
of innocent scandal? hush-mum-it gives a piquant seasoning to thy
discourse, friend Knowy."
 </p><p>   The newsman, catching at the hint, said-" By-the-by, were I but
sure that it would go no further, I could give you, friends, a rare bit of
tittle-tattle; but, no, I'd better keep it to myself, for were it known
that I had set it floating-"
 </p><p>   The moment he threw in a dash of mystery, that moment did every
one present desire to learn more.
 </p><p>   " And, besides, it were cruel to draw an honest neighbour into ridicule."
 </p><p>   I love to laugh at my neighbours," said Silkworm.
 </p><p>   "And I'd rather laugh than cry at any time, or at any thing," added
Catchemayde.

  </p><p>   Here Brassinjaw began to snore, and pretended to go fast asleep.
  </p><p>   " Come, Master Knowy, speak out, man," said Checklocke; "we love
 a bit of scandal, particularly about our own dear friends; and see, Brass-
 injaw is fast asleep, so you need fear to offend no one here."
  </p><p>   " Well then," said Knowy, " it's about a certain person, not a hundred miles from this very house."
  </p><p>   " Not Driggles," exclaimed one, " the lantern maker, whose wife broke
 his head with a ladle ?"
   </p><p>  " Or Bunks, the buttoner, who could not get up, for his wife had run
 away with his slops and his hose ?" said another.
  </p><p>   " Nearer than that," replied the newsman, "and his name begins
 with H."
  </p><p>   " It can't be Master Hewet? No, you don't mean it ?" and then
 they all got closer round the newsman, and Brassinjaw snored louder
 than ever; and then they all declared they would give a sound silver
 penny each of them, ay, that they would, if they could only get one
 good laugh at Master Hewet.
   </p><p>  " Well then, my friends, give me but the silver pennies, and I'll
give you the laugh," saying this he held round his cap, into which they
threw broken pieces of money; for the penny was then coined with a
deeply indented cross upon it, which, if broken one way, made two halt
pennies, if broken again the other way, it formed four fourthings, or
as we now say farthings.
   </p><p>  Having received a goodround sum, for scandal was as high in the market
then, as it has been since, he began by saying, " Now, remember, I say
nothing, I know nothing, and therefore can tell nothing, but it is odd,
isn't it ?" They all nodded their heads, not that they had heard anything very odd yet, but they assented by anticipation, knowing that
Master Knowy was no duper, but a true man and an honest.
  </p><p>   " But it is odd, isn't it," said he, " that Master Hewet should have
such a pretty wife ?"
  </p><p>   "Oh! come," said Catchemayde, "that won't do at all-no, no,
there's nothing of scandal there, I'd be sworn."
  </p><p>   " I didn't say there was-I only said it was odd-and it is odd, that
twenty times a week, a dapper little page, more splendidly dressed
than dapper little page was ever dressed before, should call on honest
Master Hewet-I say on honest Master Hewet, and with him always
brings some costlyfruits from over seas, or else some lovely flowers.--Dame
Alyce, so the story goes, is wondrously fond of fruits and flowers-
now it's odd, but mind, I say nothing farther than it is odd, that Master
Hewet's lovely wife is now no longer satisfied with a good pillion behind
her loving lord, but needs must learn to ride upon a noble steed herself."
  </p><p>   "Well, that is odd, I own," said Catchemayde.
  </p><p>   "And it's odd, methinks, that the very horse she learns to ride upon
belongs to the master of the dapper little page---
  </p><p>  " And who is he ?" exclaimed more than one.
 </p><p>   " I say not who, but only that it is odd-that on the left arm of this
same page, the arms should there be found of young Sir Filbut Fussy !"
</p><p>    No ?" ejaculated a dozen at the least.
 </p><p>   "And odder still it is, that he who teaches the merchant's lovely wife







<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>                   .

to ride, is rich Sir Filbut Fussy's self!  But not a word, not a breath of
what I've told you as being odd, for it's only odd, and nothing more,
depend upon it. And now a right good day to you all, my worthy sirs."
On this the newsman made his exit, determining, in his own mind, that
now he had found out how well scandal was paid for, he would henceforth publicly announce himself as Master Knowy, the knowing scandal
newsman.
  </p><p>  The rest of the party, after making their several comments upon what
they had heard, and uttering a few jokes at the expense of Master Hewet,
determined to go past the merchant's in a body, and if the page, or Sir
Filbut Fussy, should be there, to set up a horse' laugh, and then run
away. Fortunately for all parties, they were disappointed in their kind
intention. The moment they had all left the room, Brassinjaw opened
his eyes-but they had been pretty well opened by the newsman, and in
a manner he had little expected : he was evidently greatly annoyed, and
frowned prodigiously. He got up, put on his bonnet, and left the place
muttering as he went-" She shall do a pretty penance for this, in purse
as well as person.  I'll not leave a bit of skin on her knees, nor a silver
penny in her purse. I'm not angry with her for disliking her husband,
for who can like the fellow-I have hated him ever since he refused to
be one of my flock. Nor am I angy that she should discover beauties
in the rich fool, Sir Filbut Fussy; no, for all this I might find absolution;
but I'll never forgive her keeping the secret so snug from me. Why,
properly used, it would have been a little fortune to me; but it may not
yet be too late to do something in the matter."  A short time after this,
the saintly father Brassinjaw might be seen seated upon a little fat
long-eared mule, that trotted along the road up Chancery Lane, then a
lovely lane bordered by green hedges clothed in May's most tempting
livery. The truth is that in a lonely cottage in the fields near Holbourne,
Harry Horton had taken up his quarters, the whole tale of his own, or his
father's illness being a mere subterfuge, an excuse for remaining away
from his master's abode, until he saw how matters were likely to turn.
Here he could unnoticed by any one carry on his schemes, and it was here
that Sir Filbut Fussy was made to pay rather dearly for the assistance
and advice of Horton in the conspiracy, carrying on against honest
Master Hewet and    his simple-minded lovely spouse.   Brassinjaw
was not so great a fool as to imagine that Harry Horton was not aware
of all that had been going on under his master's roof, and was now on
his way to come to an explanation, and to settle upon what terms he
was either to speak out or to hold his peace; the scheme of villany
concocted between them at this interview we must leave the incidents
themselves to elucidate.  But this much we may here relate, that Sir
Filbut-therich Sir Filbut-became one of the saintly father Brassin-
jaw's flock, and it occurred strangely enough, that father Brassinjaw's
memory became suddenly so bad, that he was for ever appointing the
same day, and the very same hour, for receiving the confessions both of Sir
Filbut and the lovely Alyce, by which it naturally occurred that they were
for ever meeting in the chapel of Saint Thomas of the Bridge, for as the
reader may have perceived, Alyce was rather given to holy views,
and Sir Filbut now became prodigiously religious.

   </p><p>     It was Friday, the 19th of May, when, about the middle of the day,
    a single gun was heard to boom loudly from the Tower walls; at that
    moment, the head of the once madly-adored Queen of Henry the Eighth,
    the lovely Anne Boleyn, had fallen beneath the sword or the Calais executioner. So unexpected a sound naturally drew the inhabitants of
    Old London Bridge to the casements which looked towards the east.
    The hour of the Queen's execution had been kept a profound secret from
    the public, so that the awful scene was witnessed but by few.  There
    were two circumstances connected with the death of this unfortunate
    creature, which, perhaps, as much as any, speak the heartless and cruel
    nature of her tyrant lord; the one was placing her as a prisoner in the
    very same apartments in the Tower in which she had slept the night
    before her coronation, when she had arrived from Greenwich in all the
  pomp that the wealth of this most wealthy city could lavish upon the
  aquatic pageant, to show devotion to the favourite of a King; the other
  was in fixing on the 19th of May for her death, that very day being
  the anniversary of her coming to the Tower. She arrived there on the
     <date value="1533-05-19">19th of May 1533</date>, in all the pride of royalty, to ascend a throne-she left the Tower on the  <date value="1536-05-19">19th of May 1536</date>, in all the horrors of despair, to
  mount a scaffold.
    </p><p>    The gun the citizens had heard was the signal to tell King Henry,
   who had gone hunting, that he was now a widower; and it is said, that
   when the anxiously-expected but welcome sound reached the heartless
   miscreant's ear, he ordered his attendants then to " slip the dogs, and
   let the chase begin."
  </p><p>      Now, although the good citizens had been prevented enjoying so rare
  a sight as that of gazing upon the first female blood that had ever flowed
  in England to stain a public scaffold, they had been, for some hours
  previously, feasting their eyes upon a different kind of death, which,
from its lingering nature, the imagination can scarcely conceive aught
more horrible--it was the execution of the Blear-eyed Bully. Crowds of
   boats, of all shapes and colours, covered the Thames below bridge, for
   the scene now taking place was one of rare occurrence, and consequently
 had drawn together an immense concourse of people.
</p><p>   The trial of the Blear-eyed Bully, as might be expected, was but a
 short affair; the evidence concerning the murder of the weaver was too
   powerful to admit of a moment's doubt; and the second murder, within
   the Court, could not for an instant be denied; indeed, the Bully knew
 himself to be so utterly lost, that he would not answer a single question, until put to the rack; and then he only gave the answer which we
, have already put into the mouth of the newsman. As the first crime
  had been committed upon the river, the sentence passed upon him was
  that he should die the death of water, that is, he should be chained to
  a pile, driven into the bed of the river at low water, and there remain
  until he had had three tides rise over him.
   </p><p>     The spot appointed for the horrid exhibition was off the stairs at
 Billingsgate, as being a part of the river most frequented by the reckless portion of the city, and therefore well adapted to so striking an
 example. As early as six in the morning the preparations had began.







<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>                    ,

The water-bailiffs had arranged a semicircle of boats, containing their
officers, all fully armed, at some distance around the fatal pile to which
the poor wretch was to be bound, thus keeping an open space about the
culprit, and at the same time preventing any chance of a rescue; for in
those days such violent attempts were not infrequent, the inhahitants of
the Clink, or of Alsasia, seldom allowing one of their body to oe taken,
or, if taken, to be executed, without at least a struggle for his freedom.
The Blear-eyed Bully appeared to have no friends of this sort, for all
who were present seemed to delight in the dreadful agonies they hoped
the murderer would have to endure.
 </p><p>    It had fallen to the lot of Checklocke, the smith, to be employed in
fixing the staples and the chains to the strong pile. This gave him an
opportunity of affording such a treat to his two sworn friends, Catchemayde and Silkworm, that they had never before known the like of.
They acted as Checklocke's assistants, and held the boat steady, as he
laboured away at his, to them all, most pleasing duty. In case that
the struggles of so powerful a man as the Blear-eyed Bully should draw
a staple, or otherwise damage the work, the smith's boat was ordered to
remain close to the prisoner, so that they would be able to mark every
change of feature: and didn't they make up their minds to enjoy
themselves
  </p><p>   About an hour after the turn of tide, such a yelling, and shouting,
and huzzaing, was heard, that it was not difficult to guess that the
prisoner was on his way to death. Several got a good ducking in their
eagerness to catch a glimpse of the Bully; for, in standing up suddenly,
they overbalanced themselves, and upset their boats. There were, as
may be supposed, not many of the windows of the Bridge-houses unoccupied, and all was noise, movement, and confusion. From the Bridge
an excellent view was obtained, for the Bailiffs' boats keeping the space
quite clear, everything close to the pile could be clearly distinguished.
Presently, two boats put off; in the one sat the Blear-eyed Bully,
strongly bound, and securely guarded; in the other, were the priests of
St. Thomas of the Bridge, amongst them our saintly father Brassinjaw.
To the front side of the pile had been affixed a sort of table to support
the feet of the murderer; but this was now out of sight, the water
having risen nearly two feet above it. A deafening shout burst forth
as the Bully took his place upon the spot appointed, the water now
reaching to his knees. A chain was then bound about his body and the
pile, like a serpent, beginning at his feet, and coiling round and round
upwards, till it finished by being passed twice around his neck, and
fastened by a strong staple to the back of the pile: this was Checklocke's
affair, and, strongly enough did he drive the staple home, and then,
looking insultingly into the face of the doomed man, asked him how
he liked it ? The only notice the Blear-eyed Bully took of him, was,
to spit right in his eye, which dreadfully insulted Checklocke, and caused
shouts of applause and laughter from those around.
 </p><p>   Before the preparations were completed, the poor wretch could clearly
feel the waters rising, and rising, slowly, it is true, but surely: what
must have been the reflections of man in such a situation ?-it is dreadful to contemplate ! The guilt of murder on his soul-the ghosts of his

victims shewing again in memory's fearful glass, like shadowy but
bloody sentinels, watching until the moment when life's great commander,
Death, should give the word to guard that soul into the prison-house
f never-ending woe--to hear the writhings of affrighted nature made
subjects of disgusting ribaldry and brutal jest ! The Blear-eyed Bully
bore his fate as though his soul had been wrought in steel. At every
rising wave, the only change that even the priests, who never ceased to
  pray, to chant, and then exhort the dying man to repent, while yet it
  was time, could perceive, was a stronger compression of the lip, and a firmen
  fixing of the eye. His hands were fastened in the attitude of prayer, and
  between them was bound a crucifix.  In this horrid situation, he had to be
exposed for hours, for, to him, death came too slowly, that comes so
quickly to all who breathe the breath of hope-but his only hope was
death! As the spectators grew tired, some moved away, and others
rowed then nearer, to get a better view of the doomed murderer. So
passed away the first dreadful hour-so the next; and on, and on, time
sped his never varying course; and higher still up heaved the monster
river, but, oh! so gently, that his deadly approach was scarcely felt or
seen--like the hand upon a dial, its motion was only told by having
reached a spot, that not long before we knew to be at a distance.
 </p><p>    The people of the Bridge had almost vanished, for the monotony was
tiresome; but still the waters rose; the crucifix that rested against his
breast was now half hidden by the flood; and still the waters rose.
Master Hewet and Edward Osborne kept their rooms that day, for they
felt that in a degree they were mixed up with the wretched man who
Was then undergoing the dreadful expiation of all his crimes; the truth
had been carefully concealed from Alyce, and the merchant had hitherto
succeeded in keeping her to tne front part of their dwelling; not so Flora
Gray; although she had been commanded not to go out upon the bal ony,
peep she would, and let little Anne peep too, and more than peep, for
she stood the child upon the upper edge of the balcony, and holding her
fast, pointed out to her all that was moving upon the flood beneath.
   </p><p>  The waters had now risen up to the very mouth of the murderer-
the boats tried to get nearer and nearer, and even as far as the Bridge,
which was again crowded, the murmur might be heard--" See, see, a
few minutes, and it's all over with the wretch."  The Blear-eyed
Bully's eyes now protruded farther and farther, as despair seemed to
take possession of his soul; he held back his head as far as the firm
manner in which it had been placed, permitted, in the vain endeavour to
raise his lips above the stream; this was indeed a moment frought with
death, for it was at that instant the gun was fired from the Tower.
 </p><p>    The sudden sound of cannon made Alyce run into the lower balcony,
 thinking some pageant was passing by, when, who can paint her horror,
 as from the balcony above, she saw her only child fall headlong into the
 raging cataracts beneath ! Her screams were frightful, as were those of
 Flora, who, startled at the sound of the cannon, had let loose her hold
 - -the child was gone !
 </p><p>    Of all the crowd of boats, not one dared shoot the Bridge to attempt
 the rescue of the child.  But, oh, what a shout was heard, as Edward
 Osborne was seen to leap from the balcony's upper roof into the raging

flood! Did we say no boat dared attempt the falls?  Yes, there was
one, and only one; it had in it a single rower-that rower was the
ragged lad, the fearless Shooter-of-the-bridge. In an instant he had
brought his boat into the power of the resistless current; then turning to
face the danger, he fixed his feet firmly against the board in front, threw
back his body until it nearly lay upon the seats behind, and like an
arrow shot through the Bridge, and down the fatal fall.  The waters
had done their dread vengeance upon the wretched murderer; the
stream flowed smoothly o'er his guilty head, and all was over. The
excitement now took a different turn; every boat hastened to the shores,
the people landing hurried to the other side of the Bridge, to learn the
fate of the merchant's lovely child, and that of the gallant Edward
Osborne; these, after they had passed the falls of the Bridge, were seen
tossed over and over by the rushing waves; and then came dashing through
the no-less-gallant Bridge-shooter. Never were the instructions of a
great master in any art more fully rewarded by success, than in the case
of Edward Osborne.   He buffetted the waves until he mastered their
power sufficiently to allow him to call in the energies of his mind to
direct his course; at last a loud peal of triumph rent the air, as the
beholders saw, to their astonishment, the youth floating on the surface,
and with one hand upholding his master's child. But there was one
more to share his glory, the worthy master of such a pupil. Billy-the-
bridge-shooter had that very moment proved his right to the title he so
nobly bore, and his was the first boat that reached the almost-exhausted
youth.  Osborne, with the child still held close to his breast, was soon
landed, and the mother and sire both kneeling in thankfulness at
his feet.
 </p><p>   Before we close this strange and eventful chapter, we are compelled to
add one incident more, scarcely less strange, and certainly not less
eventful to our coming tale, than those that have preceded it.
 </p><p>   The day was passing rapidly away, when the changeling tide having
done its worst upon the murderer, had long since been hurrying to the
ocean to tell its tale of horror, and now was at its lowest.  There still
was seen the dead body chained to the fatal pile, for the law enacted that
three tides should cover it. At this moment, a boat was seen coming up
the river, in which a solitary passenger, with trunks and other things
bespeaking the traveller, was being rowed towards the landing-place of
Billingsgate.  Before the stranger came very near the shore, he was
horror-stricken at seeing the awful spectre, that seemed to be rising from
out the flood. The waterman explained to him all that had occurred,
when he no longer felt pity for such a wretch; but curiosity impelled
him to make the man row as close as possible to the executed criminal.
Indeed, so close had the man brought the boat, that when the stranger
who was standing up in it turned round, his face came almost in contact
with that of the dead man. He gave one horrid shriek, and falling backward, exclaimed-" Oh God, it is my brother !"</p>

NIGHT'S azure mantle, spangled o'er with stars, seemed heaven-upheld
to canopy the earth, and screen day's glaring light from off the sleeping
world, as on the summit of that tower of death, the Traitor's Gate, the
Cripple sate and mused. Then, all absorbed, his fingers gently strayed
from string to string o'er that poor friendly lute, which oft before had
solaced weary hours, and made the gall of disappointed nature flow for
a time in kindliness to man.    He gazed up in the heavens, and paused
to think-what wondrous tales of joy, of sorrow, virtue, and of vice,
those stars might tell, were they     but once to speak.       Then fancy,
flitting through his wandering brain, seemed, in each orb, to fix a living
voice, and to his questions answered, as thus, unconsciously, the Cripple

  Whoo-oo-oop ! whoo-oo-oop! whoo-oo-oop !     "What, singing too,
my own sweetheart," said the Cripple, turning and smiling upon an
old grey owl that stood perched upon a part of the tower near him;
" we have had many a night-song together, sweet one, have we not ?"
Whoo-oo-oop! hooted again the owl, as if answering his inquiry.
"And many we'll have yet, I hope," he added, tenderly stroking his
hand down the feathers of the bird.   ' What, you like it, do you,
Fairy ?  But I'm  sure you do, or your wings had not been thus outspread.  Do you know, Fairy, I have often wondered which of us twain
be the most lovely-you or I ? we are marvellously handsome, both of
us.  Ha, ha ! ho, ho ! he, he---  !" and the poor Cripple laughed at his
own conceit until the tears came into his eyes. " But the worst of you,
old wife, is that you never laugh. I never yet have seen a feature of
your pretty face smile once.  Why not do as I do ?-the world laughs at
me for my lack of beauty-I laugh at the world for it's lack of sense;
but you and I have the best of it, depend upon it, for you'll ever find
the book of folly bound up in the most costly casing; while the true
diamond, wisdom, is mostly found in rough, unsightly clods of earth.
Laugh, then, pretty one-laugh, an' you love me, dear !"  Saying this,
the Cripple playfully tapped his forefinger upon the bill of the owl, who
for a time endured this freedom with stoic gravity; but apparently
thinking he was going a little too far, spread out her wings, and was
soon perched above on one of the mouldering heads that stood upon the
loftiest of the pikes. " What, my old wife run away? like the world-like
the world ! Spoil your wife and lose your wife-it was always so, and always will be so. Come back, you silly thing; for if King Harry sees the
company you've flown to, he'll swear you're a popish bird, and hang
you.   Why, that's the head of John Houghton, the Prior of Charter-
House, you fool ! I stuck it up there a year ago; and all around you are
his brother Carthusian monks; you cannot be in company more dangerous! Come back, and prove you hate the Pope, by taking the oath of
Hal's supremacy directly, or I shall have a pretty job of work; think if
I have to stick my own old wife's head up as a traitor!  Ha, ha! ho,
ho ! he, he   -!" And he chuckled at the idea. Then again seizing the

  </p><p>The owl made a movement as if relenting, and about to descend upon
the outstretched arm of the Cripple, but was checked by the sound of a
voice.  So unexpected was it, that the Cripple starting grasped his
staff, and stood upon his guard.  A  figure appeared within the turret
doorway.   A  moment more, and the Cripple dropping his trusty
weapon, sent forth his well-known screeching laugh, for he recognised
the comer-it was Edward Osborne!
</p><p>  " Well," said he, " this is indeed an honour the Cripple of the Bridgegate Tower could little dream of.  Why, boy! you are the only living
mortal that has ventured here, besides myself, for I know not how many
a-day-  So few that do get up here, ever get down again, that I'm not
over pestered by calling friends.  What ails you ?--you tremble, boy !"
 </p><p> " I do," replied Edward, " I own I do, not only at finding myself thus
suddenly surrounded by all these ghastly evidences of violence and death
-but I have had my nerves unstrung-have had my reason made to
totter, my eyes to doubt their power of vision-or seeing, see not what
they seem to see.  Willy ! you professed, unasked, to be my friend; I
now demand fulfilment of such profession. You are the last in all this
mighty city that most would come to, craving a kindly favour; you
are the first I have ever risked a favour from."
 </p><p> " Why, boy, you overpower me with your flattery !" said the poor
Cripple, who smiled with evident pleasure at finding at last one soul on
earth, who thought him worthy of his confidence.    " What can so
humble, so poor, so ugly a wretch as I am, do to pleasure one whom
nature has stamped as her own especial favourite."
 </p><p> "Willy, they tell me you have a beauty in your mind, which far
outweighs in others, their beauteousness of form."
 </p><p> "Ha, ha! ho, ho ! he, he  ! And pray, boy, what may my great beauty
be ?  Wonders will never cease; the Cripple of the Bridge-gate Tower
will no doubt yet be found Adonis in disguise. But, tell me, lad, and







<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>                    .

tell me quickly, for I cannot too soon know my charms, what may my
wondrous beauty be ?"
  </p><p>"TRUTH !" replied Osborne.
 </p><p> " Truth !" echoed the Cripple; " and is Truth, then, in your eyes, so
dazzling bright, that it blinds you to all else around ?  But in bestow
ing on me that gem, you raise me to the very throne of Solomon; you
make me the king of wisdom; for believe me it is only the really
wise, who always act by truth: your liars and your rogues, and these
are terms synonymous, for a lie can lie in deed as well as word, are
ever fools-they always in the end, by their deceit, lose tenfold what
they gain-mark that through life, and that you'll find's a sterling
truth.  Now, lad, although I cannot claim the high distinction you
would honour me withal, I promise one thing, for I am your friend, that
what I say to you shall team with nought but truth."
  </p><p>"It is feeling that," said Osborne, " which now has made me seek
you. I heard you singing from the tower; I waited awhile in the dark
below, until I conjured up such frightful visions that I dared no longer
stay alone, so mounted up the dismal winding stairs, made still more
dismal as the light of night stole through the loop-holes, and caused
fantastic shapes like spectres against the wall. But let us descend, for
this is an awful place to put the question I would ask your truth to
answer."
  </p><p>" Fear not," said the Cripple, " these are my children, and never tell
tales of what their father says or does. What is the question ?"
  </p><p>" Willy," replied Osborne, drawing nearer to the Cripple, and almost
whispering his words, " do you believe the dead ever again can walk
this earth-can come again so palpable to sight, that to doubt your
eyes would be to doubt your reason ?-do you believe in ghosts ?"  He
had scarcely uttered the word, when he had nearly fallen over the parapet from fear, for the owl, flying down as it uttered its melancholy cry,
fixed itself upon his head.
 </p><p> The laugh of the Cripple rather added, at that moment, to Osborne's
terror, than allayed it ; but the owl having been invited by the Cripple, half flew, half walked, or fluttered, along his extended arm, and
settled itself upon his shoulder
 </p><p> The youth, who was no coward but in affairs of superstition, and superstition was the governing power of that age, soon rallied; and the
Cripple, to relieve young Osborne of his fear, having consented to descend, Edward led the way, having no wish to be left alone in such a
melancholy spot, while his mind was still so much excited.
 </p><p> As he crept down the dark winding stairs, he heard the Cripple
above bidding a kind good night to all his children, and admonishing
them to watch, and not fall down asleep, as sometimes they did. The
Cripple, then closing the turret door, followed Osborne to the lodge
below.
  </p><p>Although it was the month of May, and warm too for that time of
year, a blazing fire was burning. A lamp was soon lighted, when the
owl began to whoop; but being kissed by the Cripple, and tossed up, it
flew upon the top of an old oaken press, in a corner deep in shade, and
there perched itself for the night in melancholy dignity.








                                             <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

  </p><p>The Cripple then, humming an air, hobbled about; he first hung up
 a thick sort of curtain over the little casement, through which he had
 thrust his head on the night he addressed Sir Filbut Fussy-" For,"
 said he, " the good folk of the Bridge are mighty curious, and are for
 ever prying into my domestic habits-what do they expect to see ? believe me, there are many a stranger scene to be witnessed in houses I
 could name, and on the Bridge too, than ever passed within the Bridgegate Tower."
  </p><p> He next brought forth three trenchers, on one of which was a piece
 of salted beef, the usual food of the humbler class for more than half the
 year, with bread and salt, and a flagon of sweet ale; then drawing a
 large pot, or saucepan, that stood upon the hob, further on to the fire, he
 seated himself; and looked into Osborne's face; then pointing to the
 food, said-" Now you are more at your ease, repeat your question, and
 I'll answer it-that is, if it please me so to do, for I am rather wayward, and speak, or hold my tongue, by fits and starts: but warm yourself, and drink, for I know of no power to exorcise or lay your midnight
 spectres, half so certain as a blazing fire and a flagon of bright strong
 ale."
  </p><p> Young Osborne, who had come with a mind predisposed to believe
every word the Cripple uttered, to k a right good draught of ale; then
seeing his Mentor draw forth his girdle-knife, a sort of dagger, he did
the same, and each, with his left hand, seizing upon the opposite sides
of the salted beef-they at once severed a slice a-piece, and placed it
upon their trenchers.
  </p><p> Osborne felt little inclination to eat, for his mind was full of the
strange things he wished to lay open to the Cripple; so, placing his
hand, still holding the knife. upon the table, he leant across towards his
companion, and said--" If ever the dead were permitted to revisit this
our earth-the dead has appeared to me !"
 </p><p> So solemnly did Osborne pronounce this awful conviction of his mind,
that the Cripple paused from the work he was upon, and gazed in
wonder at the youth.
 </p><p> " You know the wretch whose death I was the cause of, though
justly ? Upon his sentence being passed, he made all who heard him
shudder by calling loudly upon the fiends of hell to permit his dark
spirit to follow me and mine, through life.  He bade me guard well my
midnight couch by prayer, or I should see him as sure as the clock
should strike the dead hour of night.  Now, Willy, although I know
that Heaven's power can easily keep in check the fiends of darkness, yet,
I must own, that such a denunciation, after all the horrors I had witnessed, followed too by the dreadful death he suffered, made so deep an
impression upon my mind, that when night came, I listened to the
tolling of St. Paul's great bell with fear and horror.  I have wrought
my mind to such a pitch of nervous dread, that I cannot close my eye
of nights until the fatal hour be passed.  Not knowing what to do, ane
seeing my mistress's confessor, the father Brassinjaw, leaving our house,
I foolishly entreated him to advise me.  Instead of comforting, he has
taken from me even the hope I had, and tells me that all I suffer is a
just punishment for not before becoming one of his flock.  He has







<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>
ordered me to attend the midnight prayers in the chapel of St. Thomas-
of the-Bridge ; last night I did."
   </p><p> Here he was interrupted, and made to start, by the sudden boiling
 over of the pot, upon the fire-the frightened owl, too, gave a scream,
 and flew to another dark corner of the room; trifles as there were, they
 added not a little to his fear.  The Cripple, laughing, pushed the saucepan off the fire, lifted the lid, and stirring the contents round with a
 wooden spoon, again covered them, and desired Osborne to proceed.
  </p><p>  Osborne, drawing a deep breath, continued-" Yes, Willy, last night
 I attended at the appointed prayers: few persons were there besides
 the priests, and when the service was ended, I fell upon my knees to
 pray for ease of mind, and becoming so absorbed in the fervour of my
 devotions, I did not perceive all else had left the place, save one man,
 who was extinguishing the lights upon the altar.  As I rose to quit
 the chapel, I was startled by seeing the figure of a man standing in a
 gloomy corner; he was enveloped in a dark mantle, and motionless as
 death.  I had to pass that spot.  I kept my eyes fixed upon the figure-
 I knew not why ; when, just within arms reach, it suddenly threw open
 the mantle, and there I beheld, if e'er my eyes saw truly, the ghost of
 him who had so lately suffered for his crimes.  He stood before me in
 the very habit in which lie died.  I covered my eyes for an instant with
 my hands, for I feared to look upon it, and when I had gained courage
 to do so, the figure was gone, but in its place I foud this written paper.
 In stooping to seize it, I fancied I again saw the shadow gliding down
 the steps leading to the crypt below.  A  sudden feeling of courage
 animatd my soul, and I would have followed, but was prevented by
 father Brassinjaw, who, at that moment, ascended by those very steps.
 I exclaimed--  Let me pass ! let me pass !-'tis there ! 'tis there !' He
 held me lack, and when I explained what I had seen, he smiled at my
 credulity, and shewed me how impossible it was that ought could have
 descended  to the crypt, and he not see it. He told me to hasten home,
 and, for the future, to be obedient to whatever commands he might lay
 upon me, as the only means of relieving myself from the power of evil
 spirits, who certainly then possessed me.  I did return home, but not to
 sleep, but to ponder over and over the contents of this paper, which I
 lad, unconsciously, brought from the chapel, held with convulsive power
 within my grasp. It is evidently written in blood; look at it-look at
 it, Willy, and tell me what you think ?"
   </p><p>The Cripple took the paper, and read it aloud--  If you would avoid
 the miserable fate the fiends have doomed you to, seek the right road, by
 consulting the witch of the marsh.  To-morrow night, at ten, the moon is
 at the fall; be there, but be alone--remember, be alone, or a more dreadful doom  awaits you, than that of the shade, which, from the grave,  now
warns you.  No mortal must know what you this night have seen-
remember !"
   </p><p>" Were I to say," observed the Cripple of the Bridge, " that there were
no such things as ghosts or witches in this world, I should assert that, which
neither you, nor wiser men than you, would credit. There must be witches,
we know, or the good priests would never condemn so many poor old womnen
to be burnt alive for switchcraftt; and as to ghosts, I never met with man,








                                           <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

or woman, or child, who would dare deny them.  The only point which
staggers my reason is, why should that spirit which, while yet it was the
habitant of mortal clay, called for curses upon your head, now visit the
earth, not to fulfil those curses, but to warn you how to avoid their malignant power. But these are matters far too subtle for mortal ken-we
must, like other miracles, receive them, nor seek to learn the power by
which they are worked."
 </p><p> " But how would you have me act ?" inquired Osborne.
 </p><p> "Go, and go unfearingly," said the Cripple; "the spirit means no
harm, or it had chosen some other witch; she is, if I mistake not, the
mother of your new-made friend; therefore, if she have power to raise
up devils, she will have power, too, to prevent their hurting him who
fought to save her.  Where is her son ?"
 </p><p> "Oh, far away," replied Osborne.    "Ever since we saved my
master's child, the merchant has befriended the poor Bridge-shooter,
and has now sent him, as a safeguard to the merchandize they are shipping, some miles down the river."
  </p><p>" And Hewet, where is he ?"
  </p><p>"The merchant and Horton are both at Hampton Court; for, by
Cromwell's intercession, Master Hewet is now one of King Henry's
merchants; he has gone to take orders from his Highness for stuffs for
our new Queen's coronation."
  </p><p>"Then his wife is left alone; she must be very dull," said the
Cripple.
  </p><p>"She would be," replied Osborne, "but for the kindness of Sir
Filbut Fussy, who sometimes comes and reads and sings, to amuse her,
for hours together."
  </p><p>"Indeed," said the Cripple, " he is wondrously kind !"  Then again
stirring the saucepan, he hummed-</p><p>

 </p><p> ' Then you advise me, Willy, to go to the marshes to-morrow night
at the tenth hour," said Osborne, "and alone ?"
 </p><p> "I do; for who knows what the stars may portend ?" replied the
Cripple. "And now home to rest; for it must be on the stroke of midnight."
  </p><p>Osborne turned suddenly pale, prayed to be allowed to remain until
after that dreaded hour had passed. " I should be less fearful," said he,
"if even my master were at home."
  </p><p>"Your master! curse him!" said the Cripple; "but I shall boil
his head yet-I shall boil his head yet !" and then he chuckled again,
and began to stir round the smoking cauldron.
 </p><p> "What do you mean," said Osborne, " by that disgusting phrase you
are so frequently repeating ?"
 </p><p> " What do I mean ?" replied the Cripple, still chuckling and stirring
the steaming pot; " what do I mean ?"--the deep sound of St. Paul's
bell began to toll the twelfth hour, as he continued-" this is what I






 <pb id="p.72" n="72"/>             .

mean," and saying which, he thrust a hook into the cauldron, and drew
thence a human head!
 </p><p>  " Horror !" exclaimed Osborne, trembling all over; for in the features
he recognised those of the Blear-eyed Bully!
  </p><p> "Ho, ho ! ha, ha! he, he !-  foolish boy," said the Cripple, " fear
it not; but I had forgotten at the moment whose head it was. It was
brought this afternoon for me to  prepare for being hung up upon a gibbet
to-morrow, as a warning to all those dear, kind creatures, who take delight in committing murders, upon the Thames.  There, there it is in
again, and the lid on, so calm your fears. This is the second head I have
boiled to-day, the other was often   very different mould; it was that of a
poor monk they executed this morning, because he would not forswear
his conscience, and take an oath that the Pope was Anti-Christ, and
that King Henry was so pure, that he ought to be supreme head of our
Holy Church. The poor creature would have been saved; but your
master's sweet friend, the blacksmith minister, the great Cromwell,
who they say is soon to be a lord, swore that if the jury did not find
him guilty, and hang him up, he'd hang them up instead."
  </p><p> Cromwell was ever a bitter enemy to the poor monks; they were
 executed by hundreds, and the statement of the Cripple is no fancy
 sketch, but a fact of history, and clearly shews how little chance there
 was of justice in those days; for if the jury might be thus threatened,
 it was not likely the judges, who were more immediately within the
 King's power, would be left to their own free will in pronouncing judgment.   Whatever the King willed was lawful; for no matter how
 atrocious the crime to be committed-whether the mere cutting off the
 head of one wife that he might marry some favoured mistress-or burning a poor wretch because he had a conscience (a dangerous article in
 those days), and adding to the last agonies of that man's dreadful death,
 ly  bringing the wife and children to the pile, that while he burnt he
 might witness their sufferings at his awful fate; but such was the case,
 but the King willed it, therefore it was lawful; or, if not, there were
 plenty of miscreants basking in the royal favour, to pass new acts
 making it so. There never was, perhaps, in any one reign since the
 world   began, so much law and so little justice, as during the latter part
 of that of the heartless tyrant, Henry the Eighth. And yet never was
 the truth, "that out of evil cometh good," more fully exemplified; for
 it was to his very vices we owe the glorious reformation of our Church.
Had he never discovered his marriage with the widow of his brother
Arthur to have been unlawful, which, strange to say, he did not until
after he had fallen madly in love with one of his wife's maids of honour,
Anne Boleyn, this kingdom had still remained in thraldom to the Pope
of Rome.  But how was it, that after eighteen years of marriage, this
most religious King happened to make so notable a discovery ? Did it
arise from some sudden inspiration sent by Heaven to point out the sinful life he had been so long living with a most virtuous princess ?  No;
but from her handmaiden proving more virtuous than he had expected!
With a heartless wretch, like Henry, impediments but added fuel to the
fire of his desires, which bursting forth with renewed vigour after every
check, in the end consumed all that came within its annihilating influence:







                                                 <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>

the power of the Pope (the last but greatest), for six years had
held even the temper of Henry in subjection.  When, at last, the King
found that truckling to the Roman Pontiff availed him nothing, and that
after all the weary delay that he had endured, his haven of bliss seemed
as far off as ever, he took the weapon into his own hands, and with one
bold and determined stroke, severed for ever the Gordian knot which had
for ages tied the fetters of Rome upon our English Kings, and made them
slaves to priestcraft.  The first act of his own liberty was to destroy all
liberty around him. He proclaimed himself the supreme head of the
Church in England; but what anomalies did his acts produce! He
professed to be a Roman Catholic, yet denied the power of Rome ; he
worshipped the body of that Church, but tore out its heart, for the Pope
is in verity the heart of that ancient faith, for through him its whole
blood flows-his cardinals and his priests are the arteries and the veins
conveying the life-blood to the remotest members of the body throughout
the world. Such a blow came with but an ill-grace from one like
Henry, who had formerly so manfully stood up the champion of Rome
against the great reformer, Martin Luther, whose voice was now thundering through the world. Indeed, so highly had the Pope approved of
Henry's work, in answer to Luther, that he bestowed upon him the
high-sounding title of " Defender of the Faith," which, oddly enough,
has been retained by all succeeding Protestant English monarchs.
 </p><p> Having thrown off the shackles of the see of Rome, it was an easy
matter to find Bishops and colleges but too anxious to prove their devotion to the new head of the Anglo-Roman Church, by granting his
heart's great desire, a divorce from Catherine of Arragon, and performing
the holy rites of marriage between him and his late Queen's maid of
honour, the fair Anne Boleyn.  She being a favourer of the new doctrine, Wolsey, Fisher, and More, were soon brought to ruin or the block.
The Bible was now not only printed in the English language, but high
and low were commanded to read and study the holy work; and that
there might be no excuse for neglecting such a duty, a law was passed,
compelling the head of every church to provide a copy, to be chained to
a desk within the sacred pile, for general use. Those of the humbler
classes who could read, were invited to do so aloud to their more ignorant neighbours; and thus it was that the word of God first took root in
the hearts of the English people.  This was the second greatest step
towards Protestantism, but that it should prove so, was not the intention
of Henry. Now Henry, having cut off the head of the pontifical power,
found the limbs but incumbrances, so began to lop them off one by one,
and occasionally in greater numbers; but the time for their total annihilation had not yet arrived. The great delight of Henry seemed to be in
burning those who refused to follow the Romish religion, and in hanging
those who followed it too closely. If they denied his supremacy in holy
matters, it was of little consequence which persuasion they followed;
there were but two roads to go, the one led to the flames, the other to
the gibbet.
 </p><p> It was, as the Cripple said, the head of one of these poor conscientious,
though, perhaps, mistaken creatures, that he had that evening been
fixing upon the tower, just before Osborne visited him there.









<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>                     .

 </p><p> Osborne, feeling not only horror, but disgust, to see the unconcerned
manner in which the Cripple fulfilled his dreadful duty, bade his companion a hearty good night, and hurried away.
 </p><p> There were few places in London more melancholy in appearance,
than the road across Old London Bridge at midnight, the over-hanging
buildings, in many places, nearly shutting out the little light the stars
might wish to lend; and then the irregular line of houses, here projecting,
here receding; now a deep dark recess, as if made purposely for the
concealment of some lurking robber, would startle the wayfarer, making
him instinctively fly to the other side for safety ; now the long tunnel-like archways would seem as portals to the realms of darkness; and,
hark! what sound was that ? nought but the ever-roaring waters
passing with angry speed beneath the Bridge.
 </p><p> Edward Osborne, whose mind, as the reader may imagine, was at this
moment painfully alive to all external influences, was presently startled
by hearing, at no great distance from   him, sounds of sweetest music.
He stopped-he listened; then creeping onwards with noiseless tread,
and taking advantage of one of those deep recesses we have just noticed.
he was enabled to watch, unseen, a party of dark figures, enveloped in
cloaks and masks, who were performing beneath the window, as he
thought, of his master's house.  He had approached so close, that not a
syllable escaped his ear; and thus he heard the midnight minstrels
sing-</p><p>

 </p><p> Did his ears deceive him ? No, the name of Alyce floated on the
enraptured breeze, and echo, holding up her glass, reflected again the
gentle sound.  He could not be mistaken.    But who would dare to sing
thus openly the praises of his lovely mistress ?  'Tis true, that another
Alyce, and with bright eyes too, dwelt on the opposite side; and she
was known to use those bright eyes for other purposes than reading
prayers, unless indeed such prayers as love alone can write within the
Volume of imploring looks.
  Such were the thoughts of Edward, during the pause between the








                          <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>

verses; but, as the second strain began, he fancied he must be dreaming,
  for surely he saw the figure of a female, half concealed, standing by the
  casement of his master's room; and, presently, a white hand stole gently to the latch that held the window close, and then the lattice slightly
  moved, as if to admit the sound more clearly; but all was evidently
  done with greatest caution, that those without should know not that
  their flattery was listened to.
  </p><p>  The serenaders having finished their task, or fancying they heard the
  night-watch coming, moved away.  As they passed the spot where Osborne stood concealed, one or two of the voices sounded familiar to his
  ear: the only words he could distinguish, for the party moved rapidly
  along, were-" Be not afraid, success is certain; Alyce--"  All else
  died away, amidst the confused noise of the falling waters.
  </p><p>  Osborne, the moment they were past, hurried to the spot they had
  left, and gazed, not at his master's house, for he could not bring his
  mind to believe that Alyce Hewet, the angelic Alyce Hewet, could possibly be the subject of any lover's midnight adoration, but his eye was
  directed to the opposite dwelling: all there was still.  He looked, and
  looked, till fancy half pictured the form of Alyce Vaughan, their young
  and pretty neighbour, flitting by her latticed window.
   </p><p> Having now quite satisfied his mind that it must be she, whose charms
  had called forth the praises he had heard, he opened his own door; but,
  as he entered, he thought he saw another figure issuing from a recess,
  like the one he had himself occupied, and stealthily creep along in the
  same direction the serenaders had taken.
  </p><p>  His thoughts suddenly reverting to the shadowy form he had seen in
 the chapel, he hastily entered and closed the door.</p>

 that the very sight of me should make you tremble like a love-sick girl
 as she first confesses her naughty passion, before her frowning priest ?
 Arise, and speak out boldly what you have to say."
 </p><p>  These words were addressed by the giant, Henry the Eighth, King of
 England, to Master William   Hewet, who humbly knelt before his
 Highness, in the beautiful gardens of Hampton Court.  At some little
 distance behind Master Hewet, was Harry Horton, also kneeling.
 </p><p>  At the King's command they both arose, but kept their eyes most
 modestly fixed upon the earth, as if dreading the refulgent rays that
 needs must encircle a royal brow, and which might blind them with
 their dazzling lustre.
  </p><p> "You owe me no thanks," said the King; " take them all to our
 trusty and well-beloved Cromwell; 'tis he to whom they are justly due,
 Now, merchant, shew me thy stuffs and wares."






<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>                    .

 </p><p>   Upon this Horton advanced, for in his charge were all the samples
 they had brought, and sinking upon one knee he held up the various
 cases, that Henry might see to what wondrous perfection the looms
 and handy-works of various nations had been brought.
   </p><p> "For such variety, Master Hewet," said the King, " you must have
 ransacked half the world  hast thou many ships ?"
   </p><p> " Thanks to your Highness for teaching us how to build them, and
 the royal encouragement ever held out to all who would advance the
 knowledge of the sea, I have many-and such as would do the King's
 Highness good service, were a foreign foe to threaten his now thrice
 happy shores."
   </p><p>"Well spoken, merchant; but we think while bluff King Hal-
 ha, ha, you blush, do you, for you see I know how the villains of the
 city profane our royal name-no, no, while bluff King Hal shall reign,
 we need fear no foreign foe; send thy ships whither thou wilt in peace:
 to what lands do they mainly sail ?"
 </p><p>  Master Hewet was so delighted at the King's affability, and feeling
 himself addressed upon a subject in which his soul delighted, started off,
 almost forgetful of the royal presence. " They sail, your Highness, principally to Brazil and Guinea; to Sicily, Candia, and Chio, Cyprus, and
 Tripoli, and even to Barutti in Syria."
  </p><p> " And carry away all your poor King's gold, I suppose ?"
  </p><p> "Not so, your Highness; we take out woollen cloths and calf skins, and
 in exchange bring silks and camblets, rhubarb, malmsey, muscadel,
 and other wines, oils, cotton, wool, rich Turkey carpets, galls, and
 spices--"
   </p><p>" Tut, tut, tut, man!" exclaimed the King, "we want not the
 ledger of our Custom-house rehearsed; pay but the duties, and I'll
 forgive the items." He then again looked over every article, asking
 innumerable questions; then turning to a page who waited at a distance
 --made a sign which appeared to be perfectly understood, for the page
 hurried away towards a gay and noble party, then enjoying the shade
 of a wide spreading avenue of majestic trees. The whole assemblage
 was magnificent in the extreme, and seemed to be attending upon one
 lovely creature, with perfect adulation.  This beauty might, with but
 little stretch of the imagination, have been mistaken for Venus's self,
 paying a visit to Flora's bower. The instant the page approached, she
 made a slight, but gracious courtesy to all around, left them, and hastened
 towards the King.
  </p><p> " Come hither, sweetheart," said Henry as she approached; then taking
her hand he placed it within his own arm, and smiling at her, " Now,
Jane," said lie, "let me see if thou be a thrifty housewife, or a careless
jade, as I have known some to become, when made mistress of their
husband's purse, as well as heart. Try thy skill at bating down this
unconscionable jew of a merchant, who, did he have his way, would
leave our exchequer as bare as the Pope would have done, had I not
clipped his nails, or rather, I should say, cut off his hands, and thus
made him give up his hold upon our land."

Queen just dead, but now herself Queen of England, appeared at once

 to have gained right royal ideas of extravagant magnificence; nothing
 was too costly, nothing was too splendid; but she had such a meek,
 and humble way of expressing her desires, that the enraptured King
 felt himself to be the delinquent, in giving way to such wicked extravagance as they were then pursuing.
 </p><p>"You are tired, love," said the King, looking anxiously into the blue
 eyes of his newly-made wife, " we will choose no more to-day; to-morrow,
 Hewet, we will dismiss you. I hope my people have cared for you
 while you have been at the court ?"  Hewet bowed, as did Horton,
 who now catching the eye of the King, Henry said-" Stand forth,
 young Sir; are you my merchant's apprentice, Henry Horton ?"
 Both Horton and Hewet could not disguise their surprise at such a
 question coming from the King, who, laughing, added, " You see, friend
 Hewet, a King has eyes and ears, that extend far beyond the walls of his
 palace. I know more of you and yours than you dream of; for instance,
 you have a monstrous pretty wife. Don't be jealous, Jane ! But I must
 see her, Hewet; I must call and see her-I'm fond of pretty wives !"
 Hewet and Horton felt that it required no ghost to tell them that;
 but touching the King's threatened visit to his wife, the merchant
 thought it was an honour he could very well dispense with.
 </p><p>"Is she musical ?" said the King; " I love music, although I'm but
 an indifferent musician."
  </p><p> Hewet, who knew human nature well enough,to be quite aware that no
 one be he King or pedlar, was ever yet offended at being praised, and
 now, having a legitimate opportunity of offering his humble mite of incense, on the altar of Henry's talents, boldly exclaimed-
  </p><p> "Upon that point, I must venture to tell the King's Highness, that
 not only I, but all the world, differ from him. The voice of nations has
 proclaimed those two great works, the masses, composed by your Highness, to be wonderful productions of inspired genius."  This assertion
 of Master Hewet's was not far from the truth; for Henry was not only
 an excellent performer upon several musical instruments, but the composer of two full masses, besides many other smaller pieces, possessing much merit.
 </p><p>" Hewet, you are a traitor," said the King, evidently pleased with
 the merchant's well-timed flattery, "you are a traitor, to deny the
 word of your King; and, God's blood, man! you shall diethe death, unless
 you can gain favour in this fair lady's eyes to intercede for you: well,
 well, Jane, let him live. But you have not yet answered my question,
 my trusty merchant of the bridge. Is your pretty wife fond of music ?"
 Hewet assured the King that she doated on the sweet science.
 " Then take good heed, Master Hewet, for see her I will. But whom
 did she study under ?"
  </p><p>  If the King had raised the ponderous battleaxe, or double-handed
sword, with which he usually fought at the tournaments, and had let
them fall upon poor Hewet's head, he would not have felt more stunned,
nor bewildered, than he did upon hearing this simple question.
</p><p>" Well man, hast thou no tongue " said the King; " is Henry to
command twice before he be obeyed ?"







<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>                     .

  </p><p> The trembling merchant dropping his eyes upon the earth, said, in a
faltering voice, " His name, dread sire, was---Mark Smeaton !"
  </p><p> It was now the King's turn to feel awkward.   The Queen was
evidently confused; and a dark scowl came over Henry's features as he
said-" Indeed ! then as you have a pretty wife, be thankful that I have
hanged the worthless dog."
 </p><p> Hewet and Horton remained motionless, nor did they venture to raise
their eyes, until they felt that the King and Queen had moved far
away.
 </p><p>  They now escaped as quickly as possible from the vicinage of the
royal party, and walking into the most secluded portion of the grounds,
seated themselves upon a bank, and gave way to their uncomfortable
reflections: they were silent for at least half an hour, when at last
Horton said, almost to himself-" How could the King's Highness have
known my name ?"    Horton like all human beings, thought of his own
affairs first, nor troubled himself much at the awkward plight his master
had got into.
 </p><p> "How could the King's Highness," replied the merchant, "have
thought of asking me such a question? It seems that pretty wives
are always getting their husbands into trouble. I've offended the King,
I shall be dismissed with disgrace, be laughed at in the city, and perhaps
thrown into a dungeon: was there ever such an unfortunate wretch as
I ?  What can I do ?-what can I say ?-how shall I act ?"
</p><p>  " Be dumb !" said a voice, close to where they sat; but it was a voice
which made them start to their feet, and then fall on their knees-it was
that of the King. " Be dumb upon what has happened," he said, advancing, " and fear nothing. You did but obey my commands ; always
do that, and I will forgive even a greater offence than the one you have
now committed."  Then motioning Horton to retire out of hearing, he
continued-" If you are to be my city merchant, as Cromwell desires
you should be, remember, I do not merely buy your stuffs, but your eyes,
your tongue, your ears, nay, your very soul. I require a trusty agent
in the city, who is well approved by his neighbours, and I have chosen
Master Hewet. The knaves are growing too wealthy, and perhaps I
may require you to tell them so; but all such matters will come through
Cromwell."
 </p><p> Master Hewet began to understand, that Kings' favours are not always granted for nothing; and he had already a slight misgiving that
he should, in one way or the other, have to pay pretty dearly for the
honour of being styled the royal merchant; but it was too late to recede;
so he kept continually bowing his approval of every design propounded
by the King.
 </p><p> This mute, but ready acquiescence to all his wishes, brought Henry
once more into boisterous good-humour; and having told the merchant
to call " the lad," he surprised them both by saying-" Horton's time
of service is nearly expired-is it not ?"
 </p><p> Both master and man here bowed.
 </p><p> "Have you any objection," he said, chuckling at his own intended
wit, " to transfer his indentures to one Harry Tudor, a worthy, respectable, hard-working man, in his vocation ? he is a large manufacturer of







                                           <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>

  titles, and mends holes in great men's estates, by patching them up with
  heiresses; he also deals in coronets, and often gets cheated by his customers, who seldom make good their promised payments; he deals in a
  wholesale way at times, and has vast stores in many ports, as well as in
  London--know you such a dealer ?"
  </p><p>  Hewet and Horton were too much delighted at finding the King in
  such good humour not to chime in with his conceit, so put on looks of
  perfect innocence, as if they found it impossible to guess whom the
  King could really mean.
   </p><p> " Well then," said Henry, " if you recognise him not by the name
  of Harry Tudor, I'll warrant ye, ye scurvy city knaves, that you know
  him well enough if I call him bluff King Hal-he wants an apprentice,
  and proposes to take Horton off your hands; what say you ?"
  </p><p>  The merchant knew not what to say, doubting how much the King
  meant as a joke, how much for earnest.
   </p><p> Observing Hewet's embarrassment, and perceiving the Queen with
 her ladies approaching, Henry told them to wait upon Cromwell, who
 should explain all his wishes.
 So bowing, and receding backwards as they bowed, they managed to
 retreat into a friendly avenue, and then turning, pursued their way
 toward the palace, in high glee at the unexpected happy termination of
 their second interview with the King.
   </p><p> They had scarcely ended their midday meal, when a page, entering
  their apartment, delivered the commands of the Queen, that Master
  Hewet should attend her pleasure in her own chamber; and another
  message from Thomas Cromwell, that Henry Horton should forthwith
  repair to his private apartments, and be honoured by an interview with
  that great favourite of fortune, as he then appeared to be, and learn,
  through him, the pleasure of the King.
  </p><p>  Horton followed the page, and, as he had to remain some time in
 the anti-room, he could not resist a feeling of disgust, at witnessing
 the cringing servility of lords and nobles, churchmen, and men high in
 the law, to all those who assumed the power, for few really possessed it,
 of opening, or keeping closed to them, the door to the audience chamber of
 this second most powerful man in the whole realm.
    </p><p>Thomas Cromwell was, as the reader already knows, the son of
 Walter Cromwell, now a brewer, formerly a blacksmith, at Putney, and
 had raised himself, by his own talents, to the exalted pitch he had now
 attained. When a lad, he had run away from home; was afterwards a
 clerk in an English factory at Antwerp; then entered the army, under
 Prince Charles, Duke of Bourbon, and, it is said, was at the sacking of
 Rome, in <date value="1527">1527</date>. After acting as a trooper in the Italian wars, he once
 more resumed the character of a mercantile man in Venice, then
returning to England, took to the study of the law, was appointed
solicitor to the great Cardinal Wolsey, after whose fall, he solicited an
audience of the King, and proposed such bold steps of defiance towards
the Pope, who still refused to sanction the divorce of the King from
Catherine, and his union with his then beloved Anne Boleyn, that Henry
at once took him into his confidence, made him one of his council, the







<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>                  .

head of which he very soon became, and next to the King himself,
swayed the whole power of the realm.
 </p><p> Henry, from being one of the richest monarchs in the world, which
he was at his accession, had been so prodigal with his wealth, that he
now found himself at times very straitened in his means; but here
again the boundless resources of Cromwell's mind in discovering expedients once more shone forth.  He had been the instrument of severing
for ever the power of Rome from this land; he now was busily maturing
a scheme which for greatness of conception, and we may add, villany,
had perhaps never been equalled, we mean the total suppression of the
monasteries and religious houses all over the kingdom.  This determination was not yet fully promulgated; the people were not at this
early season of the coming Reformation, prepared for such a violelt
change from all the old habits of slavish veneration for everything held
up as sacred by their pastors.
  </p><p>It was therefore necessary, in the first instance, to undermine the
powers these pastors possessed over the minds of their devotees, by
proving the vicious lives they led, to lay bare to the world the
ingenious machinery by which they worked their miracles, and indeed,
to bring into contempt all that had hitherto been most revered.
 </p><p> Fortunately for the success of Cromwell's newly-formed scheme, and
unfortunately in an equal degree, for those against whom he was about
to wage war, the whole fabric of the church in England, had from ages of
corruption, descended to such a depth of degradation, that the difficulty did
not lie in finding ample specimens of the rottenness of the system, but,
amongst so many weeds of noxious growth, the labour was to discover
the virtuous exceptions.  Doubtless there were many, and many; but it
was impossible to sift the good seeds from the chaff, as when a limb, by
mortifying, must suffer amputation, to preserve the rest of the body,
a portion of the wholesome flesh invariably dies with it, the exact line
of demarcation between the healthy and the diseased portions is impossible to hit.
 </p><p> Had Henry been as rich now as he had found himself upon coming
to the throne, this great war against the monasteries had, perhaps, never
taken place, at least in his reign; but his necessities made him listen
with a greedy ear to any plan which was likely to replenish his exhausted coffers; and what could do this half so effectually as, at once,
seizing upon the enormous wealth, in lands, and gold, and jewels,
possessed by the overgrown, overbearing, monastic powers ?  As an
instance of the wealth of Religious houses, it is said that at one time
the Templars alone possessed no less than sixteen thousand manors.
 </p><p> To bring about the degradation of the monks, the friars, and general
priesthood, Cromwell required agents, who knew no virtue but that ot
obedience to his will. It was on this account he had fixed upon Horton
as a fitting tool, for he had spies in all directions, to find out who and
what men were.
 </p><p> Presently the gentleman in waiting called the name of Master Henry
Horton. Horton, who felt that now or never was his chance, arose
from the seat on which he had been resting, and from which he had been
studying another chapter in the book of human nature; but it was an








                       <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

  easy chapter, and required as little conning then, as it does at this day.
  The whole interest of that chapter, might be summed up in one word,
  SELF!  He had learnt it now by heart, so entered the audience-
chamber of the great Thomas Cromwell, armed at every point to gain
  the prize he coveted-advancement.
  </p><p>  The room into which he was ushered was small, and displayed no
 great magnificence of appointments. Cromwell was seated, writing,
 he did not condescend to raise his head, nor did he cease from his occupation, but as he wrote, he said-" Your name is Horton, Henry
Horton-you knew a man they called the Blear-eyed Bully ?"
</p><p>   Horton, more than once in his life, which was, it must be owned, but
yet a short one, had been surprised at what he had heard; but to say
  that he was now surprised, would be to use a term of unmeaning weakness-he was paralyzed! Could he have commanded the invention of
  inspiration, to have combined a certain number of words as the most un--
  likely salutation that could have met his ear upon the present occasion,
  it would have been the one now uttered by the King's great favourite.
    Horton, having hesitated for a moment or two, was about to offer
something after the fashion of an excuse for his unfortunate knowledge
of such a character; but he was interrupted by Cromwell, saying--" I
require no answer; I merely put the question to show Henry Horton
that I know him.  Possessing, as he now is aware I do, his real character, he has merely to say-will he serve the King's Highness, or will
  he not?"
</p><p>  Horton, upon whom the few words uttered by Cromwell had all the
effect intended, felt that to beat about the bush with such a man was
to lose the game altogether, answered boldly-" With heart, and body,
and soul!" and then stood, silently awaiting his new patron's pleasure
to speak.
  </p><p>Cromwell now, for the first time, raised his eyes towards the youth,
  and, by the expression of his own countenance, read something in that
  of the other, which pleased him much.
  Be seated," said Cromwell; then looking him full in the face, he
  continued--" You know something of ecclesiastical life, though a mere
elothworker's apprentice-do you not ?"
</p><p>" I do," was Horton's answer; " and more than I should say was
holy."
</p><p>" Who taught you ? the saintly father Brassinjaw, of St. Thomas's
chapel, on the Bridge-ay ?"
</p><p>  "He has taught me somewhat of priestly rogueries; but my own
  observation has taught me more."
 </p><p> "Then you think, young as you are, you could detect a flaw, if there
were one, in the lives of either abbot, or monk, or even in that of a
pretty nun ?"
 </p><p>   " In the last I'm sure I could," he said, smiling.
</p><p>"You see, young sir, that the whole world has become so wicked,
that now there is even an outcry against those to whom we have hitherto
always looked for examples of virtue and of piety. Now, to save the
King's realms from utter ruin, and the wrath of Heaven, it has become
incumbent upon us, who are the humble instruments by which either







<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>                    .

the weal or woe of this great kingdom is to be brought about, to institute such rigorous investigations, that the guilty shall not escape, nor
shall the innocent be made to suffer for others' crimes. A commission is
about to be issued, to examine into the lives and habits of every member
of the religious houses that now are covering and devouring the land.
It is upon that commission you will be employed; your duty is to find
out vices; from what I have heard, I imagine you know the meaning of
the word, so that there needs no further explanation. You will receive
an order upon the King's treasurer for your proper appointments; be
vigilant, and remember that it is vice, and only vice, that you are to
ferret out wherever you are commanded to appear. Take this dispatch
to my house in Throgmorton Street, and there await further instructions.
I will make all arrangements with your former master. You are now
in the service of Thomas Cromwell."
 </p><p> Horton took the dispatch, and bowing profoundly, left the presence
chamber.
</p><p>  A groom was already in waiting to conduct him to the various offices
he had to pass through; and, without having seen master Hewet, he soon
found himself mounted on one of the King's horses, hurrying towards
London.
 </p><p> Had the whole bagfull of Fortune's chances been sorted out, and
had Horton been allowed to choose his own, he could not have fixed upon
one more after his inmost heart than the appointment he had thus unexpectedly received. He was quite old enough in iniquity to comprehend the full extent to which he was expected to go, when the commission should once be set in motion. He was to find out errors in the
priesthood, and if he could not find them, he was to make them; that he
clearly saw, and fully adequate he felt himself to be to carry out the
grand intentions of his employers. When he arrived in London, which
he did in an incredibly short space of time, for his impatience would not
allow him to loiter upon the road, the first person he went to was his
late master's tailor, for he thought that would be as likely a way as any
to spread the report of his advancement; and, besides, he felt that the
blue and white livery of the apprentice was but ill-becoming to one of the
King's Highness's commissioners, which he knew he was soon to be. He
stopped at a small tailor's shop near Aldgate. Within, upon a workboard, were seated an old man and a lanky, mild-faced boy. The old
man had spectacles upon his nose, and was, at the moment Horton
stopped, admonishing his son for neglect of duty, by being ever employed
in reading, when he should be working.  " But I'm not, father," said
the boy, " indeed I'm not; I do more work in the day, than any journeyman I know."
 </p><p> " But that only proves," said the old man, " how much more you
might do, but for those stupid books. I'm of the same opinion with that
good creature, Father Brassinjaw, who says he has little doubt of printing
having been the invention of the devil, in order to injure the Pope, and
all his loving subjects."
 </p><p> " Talking of the Pope," said the boy, " puts me in mind of the Pope's
head on Cornhill. I can't discover anywhere what that house could
have been; it must have pertained in olden time, to some great estate,








                          <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

or rather to the King of this realm, as may be inferred both from the
largeness thereof, and by the arms, to wit, three leopards passant,
gardent, which were the whole arms of England, before the reign of
Edward the III. that quartered them with the arms of France, three
fleur-de-lis-- "
 </p><p> " Boy, boy, you drive me mad," exclaimed the old tailor; "one
  can never mention a single word, but it calls forth your nonsense about
Some old place in London.  There, you've got a book under your legs
now."
 </p><p>   "I know I have, father; for when I am winding thread, or doing
anything that does not require my eyes, I always read between my legs,
and I'm sure that can do no harm to any one."
  </p><p> And who was this boy ? It was one who was laying the foundation
 of an unostentatious immortality; it was the kind-hearted, simple-
 -minded, industrious John Stow-the beloved of all the later historians
 of our land, the indefatigable searcher after truth, the " Old," the
 "Venerable Stow."   So accustomed are we to hear one of those
 epithets pronounced in conjunction with the name of Stow, that it
 seems to us of the present day next to impossible, that " Old Stow"
 could ever have been " young Stow;" but after what we have said, we
 do expect that even antiquarians, and they are not people to be easily
 drawn from an opinion, will believe, with us, that he was once actually
 a boy !
 </p><p>"Come here," said Horton, in an authoritative tone, "and hold my
 horse; do you hear ?"
</p><p>   Young Stow looked up, as did the old man from over his spectacles
and both evinced great astonishment at seeing the apprentice, Harry
Horton, alighting from a superb horse. Young Stow ran out to hold the
bridle, and Horton entered the tailor's dwelling.
 </p><p>  " Why, master Harry," said the old man, "what want ye, lad?
 Doth thy slops still cut thee at the knee ? or does your master require my
 attendance ?"
</p><p> "What master ?" enquired Horton, as a sort of leading question, to
 enable him to touch upon the change in his condition.
 </p><p>"Why, marry, good Master Hewet; what other master wouldst thou
 have ?"
</p><p>   " Hewet, bah! he may do full well to commune with, for dyers, or
 weavers, or botchers like thyself, but not for us of the King's service."
 </p><p>  "Art thou mad, boy ?" said the tailor, laughing heartily; " what
 means the lad ?"
 </p><p>  " It means, that if you would hold my custom, you must hold a more
 beseeming tongue; and that you may do so, know that the favourite
 Cromwell is now my patron. Out with thy measures, and thy pattern
 book, for I have no time to waste with prick-louse knaves."
  </p><p> " Then hie thee to thy patron's tailor, puffed up frog !" said the man
 of thread and patches, with wounded pride, for prick-louse knave was
 the most degrading epithet that could be then applied to any one of his
 calling; " I want none of your custom; fools are ever fortune's favourites,
 so thou'lt be rich, depend on't; thou'lt be rich, depend on't! And if
 that rogue, Cromwell, be thy patron, tell him from me, he'll have none of








<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>                     .

my garden, either for love or money."  Saying which, the old tailor,
boiling with rage, returned to his shop-board, and set to work with a
vigour, that made him break his thread at every other stitch.
 </p><p> Horton, with enormous dignity, mounted his horse, and pursued his
way towards his patron's dwelling, as young John Stow turned his mind
in the same direction, and immediately began to study the History of
Throgmorton-street.
 </p><p> The injustice which arose from this interview between Horton and
the elder Stow-for we cannot bring our pen to commit the sacrilege of
calling any but one, " Old Stow," the " Venerable Stow" afterwards recorded in his Survey of London, and of which, we may by
and by, have occasion to speak.</p>

</p><p>THERE always appears to be, amongst the wonderful ingredients of
which a human mind is composed, one little seed, or germ of superstition,
which requires only to be watered by the cold dewdrops that fall from
the brow of fear, fanned by the breath of falsehood, and then warmed by
the heat of imagination, to grow, to bud, to bloom, and in its turn bear seed,
to propagate its kind in other minds. Ignorance is now well known to
be its native soil, and there it flourishes to an extent, almost miraculous
in its power. By superstition, the giant becomes a child; the poor weak
maid, whose trembling eyelids scarcely dared to rise, fearing to meet an
unkind look, rushes undaunted to the field of blood, and with her single
arm, makes armies fly before her !
  </p><p>Again it rises in another form, and takes the deepest root in minds
that think themselves religious; it is here its fruit is bitterest, bloodiest,
and its branches spread the farthest.  To this fell tree, we owe our own
dread word, assassin. The Assassins were a religious eastern sect, who
wandered secretly about the earth, to murder all their misthought holy
chief denounced, their superstitious minds being taught that such
vile acts were passports sure to heaven. It is to superstition we owe
millions of cold-blooded murders by fire, and sword-by tortures, whose
mere relation makes our own flesh creep upon our bones. How many a
poor old wretch has been torn limb from limb, amidst the laughter of a
mocking crowd, because some ignorant superstitious fool, who dared
profane the livery of HIM who preached but MERCY, PITY, and FORGIVENESS, pronounced her WITCH !</p><p>
   Education has done much to eradicate from our soil this noxious weed.
But superstition is like a cancer, you may cut off the main body, you
may tear it out, as you believe, by the very roots, but still there will
remain some shred, some fibre, that if but nurtured, would again spring
forth in all its old deformity. In witness of its tenacity in the human
mind, do we not see even in these, supposed to be enlightened days,







                                           <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>

men who never pass beneath a scaffold; others, who spilling the salt,
cast a portion over their left shoulder; a third class believe they must be
unfortunate for seven years, if they should break a lookingglass; or
who will dare place two knives across ? Cromwell, not the Cromwell of
our tale, but his great grandson-the truly mighty Oliver, is supposed
to have believed in lucky days; Napoleon, the second Oliver Cromwell,
is said to have ever avoided commencing any great work on a Friday!
 </p><p> We have entered into this slight dissertation upon superstition, from
an amiable feeling towards our hero, Edward Osborne, fearing that the
apparent tendency to superstition in his mind, might lower him in the
estimation of our readers; but when we remember that he lived in one
of the most superstitious eras in English History, we may surely forgive
him for possessing the same dread of supernatural powers, and of witchcraft, that haunted the minds of the then most learned and enlightened
of our land.
 </p><p> Osborne, be it remembered, had seen the ghost, or believed he had
done so, of a man, whom he had witnessed commit two murders! He
had known that man to be executed, principally by his agency, in a
manner the most lingering and appalling; and in his hand, he then
beheld an invitation, written in blood, to attend some unholy rite, that
should reveal to him his own future fate. Osborne was no coward; nor
was King Henry, although he trembled at the prophecies of the monkly-
instigated impostor, the " Holy Maid of Kent;" but still it must be
confessed, that Edward, as the hour drew nigh for his promised journey
to the hut of the Witch of the Marsh, felt his heart, in a slight degree,
fail him.  " Was he again to meet the dead ?"
 </p><p> There is something so dreadful in the thought, that we readily forgive
the shudder that ran through his every nerve, as he asked himself the
question. We have often thought, and are doing so now, literally at
the "midnight hour," for the clock of the same old church of St.
Luke, which witnessed Osborne's saving the life of the drowning boy
off Chelsea, is now sounding in our ear-yes, we have often thought
what would be the real effect on the human mind, did a real ghost stalk
into our room-not a vague shadow, an undefined something, we knew
not what, which might by argument be accounted of, but one of which
there could be no doubt. The more we reflect, the more certain we are
that were a ghost really to appear, the sight would blast the mind-
every feeling of nature would be frozen up, perhaps in death; or if a
thaw should come again, it would leave the brain one mass of madness.
No, no; no man that lived to tell it, has ever seen a ghost !
 </p><p> The doubt of the possibility that such a thing could be, gave Osborne
courage sufficient to make him fulfil his promise made to the Cripple.
 </p><p> As the evening approached, Osborne was lost in an ocean of perplexities. His master and Horton being away, he felt himself more than
ever responsible. The men employed in the merchant's business being
gone, and the shop shut up, he found himself alone in the house with
Flora Gray. Where could his mistress be? she had left home in the
morning, as usual, to take her riding-lesson with Sir Filbut Fussy, but
had not yet returned.
 </p><p> Such a circumstance had never occurred before, and Flora became uneasy,




<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>

 and began to foretell all sorts of misfortunes.  Perhaps her mistress
had been thrown from her horse-perhaps killed; but then, unless Sir
Filbut had been killed with her, he would certainly have brought home
the body, or at least come to tell of the event. Another cause of perplexity took rise in the strange circumstance, that about midday a
woman had called with a message from Dame Hewet, that Flora was to
go upon some trifling errand, to a distant part of the city, and that this
woman was to take the child with her to her mother, who, she said,
was going some little distance into the country, and wished to give Anne
a treat. The woman who came was so fair spoken, and of such a kindly, motherly style of person, that no suspicion arising in the mind of
Flora, the child was sent, and she herself went upon the errand for her
mistress, but failed to find the place she had been directed to.
 </p><p> Osborne, whose mind was full of his own projects, paid much less attention to Flora's alarm than he otherwise would have done; and, indeed, he felt rather glad that his mistress was from home, as it saved
him the necessity of inventing an excuse for quitting the house so late
in the evening; when he did so, he did it with reluctance, not because
he so much dreaded the business he was going upon, but that he felt it
unkind to leave poor Flora Gray in the place alone, now she had pictured to her mind all sorts of coming horrors. It certainly was strange
that his mistress should not have returned long ere that late hour; but
still a few minutes, no doubt, would see her and her dear child, the little
Anne; so leaving Flora gossipping with Alice Vaughan,the lantern maker's
pretty daughter opposite, he placed his flat cap upon his head, and arming himself with his apprentice-club, sallied forth, under the fearful anticipation, that he was about to learn something strange, if not of dire
import to his future fate.
 </p><p> There is in the breast of every human being, a longing desire to look
into futurity-a lingering hope that there might be found some strange
good fortune stored up for them in the womb of time ; but it seldom
occurs to any, that perchance appalling misfortunes might there be found
instead. There are few living, who have not, in one way or another,
endeavoured to cheat the future out of its secrets, some by the stars,
some by the cards; the palm of the hand too, is a favourite book of fate;
and some even now fancy, that whole lives may be found written upon
the sybilline leaves in the bottom of a cup. If such follies still find
votaries in this, our age, Edward Osborne may surely be excused for
pursuing the phantom of prophecy, living as he did at a time, when
to have denied witchcraft, would have been regarded next to insanity.
 </p><p> There was one thing connected with fortune-telling which struck him
as very odd, and that was, why did nature always pick out the most
contemptible and ignorant of human beings, to be the repositories of her
hidden secrets ? But still he had heard so many strange fulfilments of
old women's prophecies, that, although he could not prevent a rising
doubt occasionally obtruding itself upon his mind, yet he thought it
quite possible that the mother of the Bridge-shooter might be a real
witch, notwithstanding her son's denial of the fact. He had himself
been subjected to a visitation of so awful a nature, which to account for







                         <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

 by any other means than those of supernatural agency, he found himself
 totally unable.
  </p><p> The evening which had commenced in beauty, was changing, as the
 hand of night began to close the curtains of the day ; the wind which
 had hitherto been sighing, and softly kissing the roses that lay in Flora's
 lap, came now in angry gusts of sudden violence, then as suddenly
 died away; lurid clouds, sailing for the south, were covering up the
 heavens, and Osborne fancied that more than once, he heard a murmuring, like the whispered voice of distant thunder; the few boats he met
 seemed to be hurrying homewards to escape the threatened hurricane;
 not a star was to be seen, and the whole sky was now become one dark
 mass of storm-fraught clouds.
  </p><p> This unexpected change in the weather, added not a little to the
unpleasant feelings which were rapidly taking possession of his mind;
not a scene of horror that had lately passed, but now arose once more
before his imagination with all the vivid colouring of a dream. Just as
he was passing the very spot where the murder had been committed,
the whole artillery of heaven burst over his head in one appalling clap
of thunder, that made him pause aghast, paralyzed by the awfulness of
the sound; sheets of fire illumined the entire skies; peals of thunder
came in rapid succession; then the clouds transforming themselves into a
deluge, fell in torrents upon the earth.  Every nerve was exerted by
Osborne to carry his skiff quickly to the shore, but the winds were
fierce against him, and more than once had nearly precipitated him
headlong into the angry flood.  At last he succeeded in driving his boat
upon the shore, then jumping out he dragged it as far up as his unaided
strength would permit him out of the dangerous influence of the stream.
He secured it to a pole that stood near, and which he found, by the aid
of the sheets of lightning that flickered for seconds together over the
desolate marshes, and having done so, was about to bend his steps
towards the hut, whose fire-lighted window pointed out the direction in
which it lay, when, turning once more to assure himself that the boat
was well secured, he raised his eyes, and stood aghast at finding he had
fastened it to the shaft of a gibbet, from the arm of which hung down
an iron cradle, upon whose ribs the lightning played so incessantly, that
he plainly saw within it a human head, and as it swung towards him in
the howling wind, he recognised the dreaded features of the Bully.  It
now recurred to his memory, that the Cripple had told him it was that
morning to be placed up the marshes, as a warning to other evil doers.
He hurried away, and was soon tapping at the witch's door.
  </p><p> "Come in, Edward Osborne," the old witch inside was heard to say;
and at the same moment, the latch flew up with a sharp clink, and the
door stood open.  How it came so, he was at a loss to guess, for the old
woman was seated at some distance off, watching a pot that was
hanging by a long hook over the fire, and had her back turned towards
the door. Her knowledge, too, of whom it was that had sought her hut,
at such an unlikely hour, puzzled him a good deal, but it well prepared
his mind to believe in her supernatural gifts.  " Why have you loitered
thus ? The death-watch has ticked the tenth hour long ago; and think
you that fate will tarry to suit the slothfulness of mortals ?"







<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>                    .
 </p><p>  Edward closed the door, for the storm was still raging; then advancing
 towards the fire, he was struck by the painful expression of the old
 woman's face-the hand of fear seemed to have seized upon her whole
 frame, for she trembled in every limb-even the words she had already
 spoken had come falteringly from her tongue.
  </p><p> " Are you ill, good mother ?" inquired Edward, kindly; " has my
unexpected appearance terrified you ?"
  </p><p> " Thy appearance terrified me !  Thy appearance unexpected! No,
no ! But I have cause for trembling, ample cause: we ask not questions
of the white lips of death, without our own becoming blanched as well
-we ask not the voice of the grave to speak to us, with its earthy
breath, without our own breath faltering in its unhallowed task."
 </p><p>  Here she took up a dead toad, and dropping it into the boiling pot,
stirred it about, as her shrivelled lips appeared to be muttering some
mystic charm.
 </p><p> Osborne's nerves were now so completely unstrung, that he had no longer
power to reason upon what he saw or heard, but seemed to feel that he
had unwisely placed himself entirely within the power of the beings of
another world; he tried to offer up a prayer, but his memory flew away
affrighted, and all he could do, was to repeating again and again a
Parcel of unconnected words.
  </p><p> After a determined effort to subdue his nervous fear, he said-" Good
mother, let me at once tell you my errand here, and then--"
  </p><p> " You may save your breath," said the old woman, interrupting him,
 save your breath, for you may want it ere another hour be past; for,
 see, the toad sinks to the bottom-an evil sign, an evil sign ! Besides,
 your errand is far better known to me than to thyself. Think you, that
 if I have the power of satisfying your longing to look into the glass of
 fate, that I should lack the power of knowing what impelled your curiosity ? No, no ! all is known to me-all is known to me! The charm
 is nearly wrought; when 'tis fully done, then ask me what you will,
 and I will answer."  Here she once more stirred round the boiling pot,
and once more her lips moved, as muttering a charm. " 'Tis done !"
she said; then suddenly rising, placed a stick through the handle of the
pot, and holding one end, she motioned to Edward to   take the other,
and thus between them they lifted the boiling cauldron off the hook by
which it hung, and carried it towards the side of a wretched bed, which
stood in a recess at the further end of the room. The flickering light of
the fire alone illumed the miserable hovel, and threw deep shades from
every thing that intercepted its uncertain rays.
   </p><p>Osborne started at seeing a figure moving near him-it was his own
shadow on the wall. He blushed at his cowardice, and in a resolute
tone expressed his impatience to learn his fate, be it good or evil.
  </p><p> " Thou wilt know it too soon, I fear. But take this egg, and from
thine own height drop it into the boiling water-it will tell thy death."
  </p><p> Osborne would have rather learnt some more agreeable part of his
destiny first, for it seemed to his mind unnatural to begin with the end;
but being anxious now to bring his interview with the witch of the
marsh as speedily as he could to a termination, he did all he had been







                           <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>

 commanded, when the old woman, advancing with a firebrand in her
 hand, desired Osborne, by its aid, to look into the cauldron.
   </p><p>  He did so, but started back, for the whole water had become the co
   our of blood.-" What means this change ?" said Edward, in a faltering voice.
    </p><p> " That thy death will be a bloody one; and as the egg which held
   thy doom has burst so soon, it will be as speedy as 'tis bloody !"
   </p><p>  If Osborne did now feel his veins run chilly cold, and an icy sensation fixing upon his heart, there could be but little wonder: he feared
 to believe her words, yet longed to prove their truth or falsity.  If true,
   he knew he could not avoid his fate--if false, the sooner his mind were
   relieved the better; so he said--" Witch, or fiend, or devil-be you one
or all, I'll put your soothsaying to the proof, or I will swear away your
   life, and have you burnt in Smithfield, for the witch you pretend to be !
   The cause of my coming here was a command from the dead: if you possess, in truth, your vaunted power, call up again the vision that haunted
   me in the midnight chapel !"
 </p><p>  "And would you dare to look upon that form again ?" said the old
woman, trembling.
 </p><p>   " I would," replied Osborne, "and from his dead lips learn the truth
    or fasity of your prediction."
  </p><p>  " Be warned in time !" the old woman exclaimed.
  </p><p>  "Impostor ! trifle no more !" Osborne said, savagely.
  </p><p>  " Then thus of thy blood I wash my hands."  As she uttered these
    words, she moved her hands about, one over the other, as if in the act of
    washing them, and then continued-" 'rake that burning brand in thy
    right hand, and with thy left remove the coverlid from off yonder
 bed."
 </p><p>She had pronounced this sentence with such evident self-belief in her
 own powers, that Osborne hesitated for a moment to fulfil her injunctions; but sneering at his own credulity, he seized the brand, and tearing the tattered clothes from off the bed, stood transfixed with horror, for
   there he saw the body of the Blear-eyed Bully, lying as though he had
   been again in life.
</p><p>"Wilt thou ask thy fate of him ?" demanded the old woman, in a
   voice trembling with emotion.
  </p><p>   "No, no-I dare not !" Osborne replied, as he fell sinking to the
 earth.
  </p><p>   "Then learn it unasked !" exclaimed a voice of thunder. The figure
   rose up suddenly, and in another instant Osborne found himself within the
   iron grasp of a giant.  Two men, or fiends he knew not which, rushed
   from behind the bed, and before he had the power to collect a single
   thought, they bound him hand and foot, and he was powerless; the old
   woman had fallen dead or senseless upon the ground.
    </p><p> So suddenly had all the latter portion of this strange scene occurred,
   that Edward fancied he must be in a dream; but he was soon made
   sensible of the reality of his awful position.
    </p><p> "Fool!" said the ghost, for such Osborne still found it difficult to
   persuade himself it was not; " and did a boy like you dream of playing
   with the lives of men, and think that none were living to avenge the







<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>                   .

dead ?  I am the twin-brother of him you brought to death; and I am
his twin in mind as well as in form and feature.  When I learnt that
it was to you and to your master the payment for his death was due, I
formed my plans.  I had, at first, intended to have followed you where-ever you went, in these habiliments in which my other self perished--
to have dogged your steps at every turn, and by making your life a hell
on earth, by the supposition that a dead man was ever lying in your
path, have driven you by torturing degrees to hopeless madness: for your
master, I had other schemes-but my plans are changed. It is now
my intention to bind you face to face to the head that at this moment
swings in the night-breeze from the gibbet by the water's edge, and there
let you hang by the neck till you are dead."
 </p><p>  " Monster!" exclaimed Edward, "you will not dare to put your
horrid threat into execution; and if you would, these men, if men they
be, cannot stand by and see so bloody a crime committed."
 </p><p> Ha,ha, ha, poor boy !" the other replied; "open your eyes and gaze
upon them well; you have met before-the murderers of the weaver;
those who assisted then are not the most likely to withhold a helping
hand in such a trifle as a baby's death. Come, away with him ! Don't
be afraid that you shall die too soon; 'give and take' is our maxim.
You provided a lingering death for my brother-his brother shall find a
lingering one for you.  You shall suffer drowning a dozen times before
we hang you up to die."
 </p><p> The other two wretches now hurried with Osborne borne between
them, struggling with all the might his bound limbs could muster; he
screamed out murder with all the strength despair could bring him, but
his cries were only answered by the mocking wind and laughter of those
who had him so completely in their power.  They threw him into the
water; he struggled hard, but they held him down until they believed
him nearly dead; then drew him forth, and laid him on the ground until
he should recover consciousness sufficient to endure a second death.
They all sat down beneath the gibbet to watch him.   The storm of
thunder and lightning had passed away; the wind still howled as
]oudly as ever, but its violence broke up the clouds into large masses,
which rolling away in awful grandeur, let in the moonlight, which, for
the time, rendered all around as clear as day.  "Do you hear him
breathe ?" said the brother of the Bully ; to which the other answered,
</p><p>" Who can hear anything, with such a bellowing wind as this ?  I wish
you'd let us hang him up at once, for see, he moves."
  </p><p>"Well, do as you like," said the first speaker, "he will make a
pretty example, and a glorious warning to other meddling apprentices,
when he is found hanging here in the morning.    Oh! it's turned
desperately cold," he added, as he seemed to be seized with a fit of
ague; "the sooner the work be ended, the better, for I must get something to warm me now. Slip this noose over his neck, and let us haul
him up at once."  As he said this, he rose up, and threw an end of a
rope over the arm of the gibbet, as the other men were fixing the noose
round the neck of the affrighted Osborne, who had recovered full
consciousness of his dreadful situation. He gave all the resistance his
helpless state would allow, and endeavoured again to scream  aloud.








                                           <pb id="p.91" n="91"/>

The bank on which he lay was very steep; just as they had succeeded
in fixing the rope about his neck, he drew his knees up almost to his
chin, then, with a despairing effort, sent out his legs so suddenly, that one
of his murderers was cast headlong down the bank into the water; the
other two rushed to his rescue, but the tide was so strongly running
round the projecting point of the land, that it carried him out of his
depth.  Not being able to swim, he called aloud for help.
 </p><p>  "Run and untie the boat," said the principal of the wretches; the
other hastened to the gibbet and did as he was told, while the Blear-
eyed Bully's twin-brother, jumping into the boat, pushed off to the rescue
of his companion. He had scarcely accomplished the task, when the man
at the gibbet ran frantically to the water's edge, and madly called
upon them  to return, and take him  aboard the boat. As the boat
touched the shore, and the man placed his foot upon it, a loud shout of
voices was heard near at hand.  " Away, away," he said, "or we are
lost ! See yonder crowd running hither; pull for your lives, pull, pull !"
The boat in which the murderous wretches now found means to escape,
was the one Osborne had come in.
 </p><p> Who can paint the revulsion of feelings which at this moment nearly
overpowered the poor youth! Despair, rushing so suddenly from his
bursting heart, found vent in a violent flood of tears; death seemed flying before his eyes, chased by a new-born life.  The crowd that now
came running and shouting toward him was composed principally of
peasants, some armed with sticks, spades, and brooms, and others with
pitchforks, upon the points of which they had hung lanterns, to hold high
up in the air, as signals that aid was approaching. What was Osborne's
astonishment to observe that the throng was headed by the Cripple of
the Bridge-gate Tower, who bounded over the earth like a swift
mountaineer, aided by his long staff  Another surprise was to observe
the peasants carrying the witch upon their shoulders, and at the
same moment to find his bonds being loosened by his faithful, humble
friend, Billy-the-Bridge-Shooter!  The moment Edward found himself
free, he fell upon his knees and thanked his God; then he jumped up,
and danced, and cried, and laughed, and kept hugging every body who
came within his reach; then he sank once again upon the earth, and
burst into a more violent fit of tears than ever. Numbers lined the
edge of the water, and shouted execrations towards the wretches in the
fast-receding boat. Osborne was soon conveyed back again to the hut;
dry clothes were put on him, which were speedily collected, part from one,
part from another, of the bystanders, so that, as he sat by the replenished
fire, he looked anything but the comely lad he really was. The old
woman, too, was paid great attention to by the peasants, who really did
believe her to be a witch, for, as they said, "who was it gave them
such good crops, if it was not her charms ?"
</p><p>  An explanation of the means of Osborne's almost miraculous delivery
was soon entered upon, by which it appeared that the Cripple of the
Bridge, who had himself too much to do with the dead to give credence to the possibility of the grave ever again giving up its prey to walk
the earth as unmeaning ghosts, imagined that some trick, but not of a
serious nature, was to be played off upon Edward, for the sake of







    <pb id="p.92" n="92"/>              .

frightening him, and nothing more; but not admiring these practical
jokes, it was his intention to be present at the game, and if it turned out
as he expected, namely, that a parcel of apprentice boys were to be the
actors, he would frighten them in turn, and lay his staff soundly about
their shoulders.  For this purpose, he had gone to the marshes sometime before Osborne was to arrive there: the night became tempestuous,
so much so, that he gave up all idea of Edward's coming; he sheltered
himself in a little out-house, or shed near the hut. At last he saw, by
the lightning's aid, Osborne at the door of the hovel. When he had
gone in, the Cripple took his station at the casement, to which there was
no shelter, and through which he saw all that passed.
 </p><p> He said--" He must own he had become intensely interested by the
scene, up to the bursting forth of the three ruffians, when his wonder
changed to alarm for Edward's safety: he knew that his own single
power was of no avail, so that when the murderers were dragging
Edward from the hut, he hurried away to seek for aid: not knowing
the marshes, he lost himself amongst the ditches and dikes; and then to his
horror, found himself again near the hut; but this was the saving of the
youth's life, for here he met the old woman, with feeble steps, trying
to hurry away for aid; she pointed out the only road to the neighbouring village, to which, with long jumps he took with his trusty staff;
he soon arrived, and was immediately on his return with the whole
village at his heels."
 </p><p> It appeared, by the old 'woman's account, that three ruffians had
come to her hut, and after beating and torturing her, they swore they
would drag out her tongue, roast it, and make her eat it; they would
then tear out her eyes; and last of all, they would set her upon her own
fire, and burn her to death, if she did not do all they commanded.
They placed themselves in such positions, that not only could they hear
every word she said, but also see, whether by look or sign, she should
attempt to give Osborne the least warning of his dreadful fate. She said
the dead toad and the egg, that seemed to change the water to blood,
were brought by one of the men, whom she guessed, from what fell
from their lips, to be one of the conjurors who attended the fairs, and
cheated the poor people out of their pence.
 </p><p> " Vell, mother," said Billy-the-bridge-shooter, " I do hope now you
vill give up your darling vitchcraft; you vosn't made for a vitch, you
vosn't; upon my life you vosn't; and you never can be a vitch as long
as you lives!"
 </p><p> The poor old woman hung down her head, and seemed to be
thinking that her son was, very likely, not far from right, but said
nothing.
 </p><p> Edward Osborne's clothes being now thoroughly dried, and he,
finding himself wonderfully invigorated by a famous supper, which had
been provided by the Bridge-shooter, who, having found himself possessed of a fortune, as he called it, namely, a few shillings, received
for his attendance at the loading of the vessels belonging to merchant
Hewet, had, upon arriving in town, spent the greater part in food
and comforts for his old mother, and it was to bring them to her,








                                            <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>

that he had so opportunely arrived.  Osborne determined to hurry home,
late as it was.
 </p><p>  The Bridge-shooter insisted upon his mother removing at once into
the neighbouring village; "for he was not going to have her murdered
there, to please her, or anybody else."  She did not object much, for
she began to dread another visit from her three friends of that night,
who had made anything but a favourable impression on her mind.
 </p><p> In those days, the furniture in most houses, was of no great extent;
use was more studied then, than ornament.  Our forefather's feet were
well satisfied to tread upon the plain boards; or, if a little gentility
must be assumed, a few rushes answered all the purposes of a modern
velvet-piled carpet; and as for linen, we may presume there was no
great stock kept, that commodity being generally manufactured upon the
premises, excepting the finer sorts, and those were imported from abroad,
which made them rather too costly to be in common use.  If the general
run of furniture was thus simple in really decent dwellings, it will not be
surprising that, but a few minutes sufficed for the packing of the whole
household stuffs belonging to the witch of the marsh.
 </p><p> Each of the party carrying a portion, they were soon ready 'to run
away by the light of the moon,' which they speedily did.
 </p><p> The Bridge-shooter carried the old bedstead and bedding and all,
which was no very heavy load, the old woman, the Cripple, and Edward,
managed the rest, and thus they trudged along towards the village.
They had not proceeded many hundred yards, before the old woman
started so suddenly, that the whole party had nearly let all the things
fall in alarm.
 </p><p> "Heavens!" she exclaimed, " where is my spirit-where is my spirit?
I'll not go without my spirit."
 </p><p> Vot, you're at your vitchery again, mother, are you ?" said her son.
 </p><p> The old woman made no answer, but was at once turning back, when
she was arrested by her  spirit" crying " mew, mew!" It turned out to
be a large old black cat, that had followed them from the hut, and
which the old woman sincerely believed was a spirit that could tell her
all the wonders of the hidden world, although it must be confessed it
had never told her anything yet, and perhaps never would. The ancient
dame took up the old cat, who purring, nestled in her bosom, and on again
the party trudged.  The old woman was comfortably lodged in the
village, and the other three started off towards Old London Bridge.
 </p><p> As they journeyed along, the conversation naturally turned upon the
recent occurrences, and Billy-the-bridge-shooter began to moralize upon
the old adage of " a man that is born to be hanged, will never be
drowned." " That's uncommon true," said he; "but then the rascals
vonted to leave you not no choice at all, for they would have hanged and
drowned you too, if they could.  Now to-night has proved to me, that
there is a third chance left for us all-and that is-ven a man is born to
die in his bed, he'll never be hanged nor drowned neither."
 </p><p> "Why, friend," said the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-tower, " you're
quite a philosopher."
 </p><p> "So mother says," replied the lad, " she often calls me a philisossifer;
and vy do you think she calls me by that rum namo ?  Vy, because I






<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>                    .

sometimes speaks a little bit of truth !-vot nonsense, isn't it ? Vy, if it
only vonted to tell truths to be one on 'em, I vunders all the vurld are
not philisossifers."
 </p><p> " Because," replied the Cripple, " the greater part of the world finds
it a difficult task to speak the truth."
 </p><p> "I think," said the Bridge-shooter, " it's a precious deal more difficulter
to tell lies.  I finds it so, I know.  Vy, truth slips out so smooth and
easy; vun never has to think about that; but ven you've got to tell a
lie, my viskers ! haven't you got to think of a lot of other things as vell,
only to keep you from being found out."
</p><p>  Edward 'Osborne, who had been too deeply engaged with his own
thoughts, upon the strange web of fate that seemed to be gathering around
him, to pay much attention to the philosophical disputation between the
Bridge-shooter and the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-tower, now interrupted their discourse, by observing-" It is evident, too evident,
that I have at last made an enemy, who will in all likelihood
pursue me through life to my ruin, or to my death; for this bold,
this fiend-like attack upon me to-night, shews that he who planned
it, is as unrelenting as he his ferocious. And my good master, too,
it appears, is to be persecuted as well; and why? because we were
the cause of bringing a murderer to justice."
 </p><p> " If that's it," said the Bridge-shooter, " I had better look out myself,
for I think I had a little bit of a hand in that affair; for in diving to the
bottom of the Thames, I happened, by good luck, to dive to the very
bottom of all the mystery, and brought the dead weaver and the truth
to light at the same time.  Now, Villy," he continued, addressing the
Cripple, " vot is your advice in this matter? vot course think you will
be the best, I mean the safest for us all ? If ve make a stir about tonight's business, ve shall get the whole of Alsatia, and the Clink into
the bargain, about our ears; the pretty lads in them quarters are no
boys to mince matters, or be behind hand with you, unless in the hand
behind they hold a knife; I know 'em vell  I think, as Master Edward is safe now, the less we says about the business the better.  ' A
silent tongue makes a vise head,' as an old rip that I knows always
says, ven he don't vont you to tell of his rogueries."
 </p><p> " For the present," replied the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-tower, "you
are right.  It is only a fool who lets the spring go, until he is sure the
rat is in the trap.  Besides, there are more wheels at work, than those
we see; by letting this one turn on, and watching carefully, we may
find a way of stopping the whole at once."
 </p><p> "How strangely," said Osborne, "does man's life at times suddenly
vary, and upon such mere chances too. Until these last few weeks, I was a
simple plodding apprentice, with not a care to trouble me-not a change
from day to day, from week to week-nay, months and years were all the
same to me, one unvarying round of monotonous existence, when all at
once, I find myself in the centre of a whirlpool of dangers.  There is
one thing I have never yet been able to account for, and it has caused
me many and many a weary hour of thought, of anxious conjecture-
that is, the mystery which has always surrounded the circumstance
of my good master being warned of the danger, which we now know was







                                           <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

no groundless fancy, that threatened me when he sent me to Putney, and
kept me there secluded until the eve of the trial of the robber Miles."
 </p><p> " Ha, ha ! ho, ho ! he, he---!" screeched the Cripple; "how simple
do mighty things appear, when the veil of mystery be removed; and yet
it seemed like fate that sent the chance to me."
  </p><p>"You !" exclaimed Edward and the Bridge-Shooter at the same time,
as they looked inquiringly at the Cripple.
 </p><p> Yes," he replied, " it was I who warned your master.   On the
night of May-day, at the deadest hour of that night, I was restless, and
wandered about the Bridge; when, seeing two lurking figures approaching towards my tower, I entered, extinguished my lamp, and was about
to fall upon my couch once more, when my ear caught the sound of
voices close to the little casement in my tower wall.  ' We shall have
him safe enough there,' said one. I started up, and placing my ear
close to the opening of the window, heard enough to tell me the plot
that was laid against you, and all about the letter recommending that you
should be sent to Woolwich.  It was I who wrote the note which may
be said to have saved your life; it was I who instructed the boy to deliver
it as he did; and I, too, it was, who sent for the Bridge-Shooter; but he
knew not from whom the message and money came."
 </p><p> Osborne expressed his wonder, and also his gratitude.  Little more
occurred of any consequence until they reached the Bridge.
 </p><p> When they arrived there, the Cripple took out a large key from his
pouch, and opening the door of the Bridge-gate tower, bade his companions a right good night, and entered, singing-</p><p>
                 <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Death is here, and death is there,
                 </l><l>And death is round us everywhere."</l></quote>
 </p><p> As he closed the door, Edward heard the old owl, whoo-oo-ooping
out a welcome to her husband, as the Cripple called himself; and then
Osborne, with the Bridge-shooter, continued his way across the Bridge
to the merchant's house.  Arrived there, Osborne was surprised and
alarmed at seeing lights moving from room to room. He knocked loudly. The door was soon opened by Flora Gray, who was crying bitterly.
 </p><p> "What has happened ?" exclaimed Edward, whose alarm was now
greatly increased.
 </p><p> " Oh ! oh! oh! oh !" was the only answer the broken-hearted girl
could utter.
 </p><p> " For Heaven's sake, Flora, speak! speak ! what has happened ?"
 </p><p> Oh ! oh ! oh !" again sobbed the poor girl, at the same time pointing with her fore-finger to the rooms above.
 </p><p> Osborne, comprehending her meaning, started up stairs, and hurrying
into the front apartment, where he saw a light, he was amazed to find
his master sitting there, apparently lost in grief.-" Master ! dear master !" exclaimed Osborne, " what, in Heaven's name, has happened ?"
 </p><p> " I know not," replied his master, taking a deep-drawn breath.
</p><p>" My wife-my Alice-and my poor child !" His utterance became
choked, and burying his face within his two hands, his head sank upon
the table near which he sat.
 </p><p> Osborne felt that at that moment he ought not to press his master
upon the cause of his grief; so again hurried down, and learnt from the








 <pb id="p.96" n="96"/>                    .

  Bridge-shooter, who had succeeded in making Flora explain, by words
  mixed up with sobs and tears, all she knew, which, indeed, was very
  little, in fact, nothing further than Osborne himself was aware of.
    </p><p> " No, no !" said Flora; " I know what my own opinion is, but that
  I shall keep to myself: I'll not let my tongue ruin any poor soul breathing-no, I'd rather have it torn out first !"
   </p><p> " Good Heavens !" exclaimed Edward, his thoughts being turned into
  a new train, by what Flora had said, " good Heavens ! I will never believe that such purity----"
  </p><p>  " That's what master says," replied Flora, sobbing. " He believes
  she's dead, and wont hear a word against her."
  </p><p>  Osborne, whose suspicions being aroused, now called to mind many
  and many circumstances, mere trifles in themselves, yet all tending to
  confirm his worst fears. He at once determined to have these fears resolved. He sent off the Bridge-shooter to several places, where it was
  just possible some tidings of his mistress might be obtained, while he
  himself hurried away, without hinting at where he was going, straight
  to the lodgings of Sir Filbut Fussy.
  </p><p>  When he arrived there, notwithstanding the day had not yet broken,
 he found persons busily employed, carrying away chests and trunks; and
 when he inquired whether Sir Filbut was there, they told him they believed he had gone abroad, and that all his things, with the exception
 of the few they were then taking to the wharf, had sailed several days
 before for Italy. Sadly, indeed, did he return to the merchant's house;
 but here, if a doubt yet lingered in his still-hoping mind, he learnt that
 which annihilated doubt and hope together.
  </p><p> While Osborne had been away, Flora was occupied in prying about,
in every corner of her mistress's room, seeking she knew not what, yet
hoping to discover some clue to the mysterious cause of her mistress's
absence.  At last, in the corner of the hearth, in which a fire had recently been burning, she found several pieces of a torn letter, some of
them partially consumed, and discoloured by the flames, others blotted,
as if by tears, yet leaving sufficient words plain enough to reveal the
real nature of the writing.  These words were of the most ardent and
passionate nature, breathing unalterable affection for her to whom they
were addressed; whom that might be, for some time remained uncertain, until again raking over the ashes, two more pieces, nearly consumed, were found; on one the name of " Alyce" could clearly be decyphered, on the other the initials " F. F."
</p><p>  Flora could not conceal her discovery for a single moment, but with
the damning evidence, rushed into the presence of her master, just as
Edward and the Bridge-shooter had entered.
</p><p>  When the merchant was told what she had found, and he cast
his eyes upon the fatal words, in characters he knew full well, he,
with the fragments firmly clenched within his two uplifted hands, threw
himself with violence upon his knees, and looking towards heaven, his
lips moved, but those around heard not what he said: was it a prayer he
offered ? or was it a blighting curse he then called down from Heaven?</p>

  </p><p>DAY after day passed by, but still no tidings of either Alyce or of her
  child.  A settled melancholy fixed upon the heart of the merchant
  Hewet.   All in his dwelling having been forbidden to speak of his unnatural bereavement, to a casual observer, there appeared within that
  house of real sorrow, but little to call forth pity or surprise. But,
  although the good merchant, in external appearance, seemed but as a
  sedate and thoughtful man, there was within his breast a hidden serpent, ever gnawing at his heart. Hewet's love for his wife had been of
  that all-absorbing nature-that one single feeling of the soul, in which
  every other sensation of his kindly nature centred.  He had had but
  one thought, one hope from the moment they had plighted their vows,
  and that hope, that thought, was for the happiness of his adored Alyce.
  So ingeniously, with such seeming truthfulness, had she returned his
  love, that to have allowed a doubt of her pure faith to take birth in his
  mind, would have seemed as sacrilegeous, as to have distrusted the goodness of Heaven itself.
  </p><p>In exact proportion to his former unbounded confidence, now came the
  bitterness of finding himself deceived.  Every incident of his wedded
  life flitted before his heated imagination, as he, night after night, lay
upon his sleepless couch; but in no one of his wakeful dreams, could
he ever picture to himself a single look, or bring to his remembrance a
single word, that had ever passed from the eyes or lips of his adored
Alyce, that should have raised a blush upon her cheek, or have blanched his
own.   But the more these reflections crowded upon his mind, the more
violent became his resentment against one, whose consummate art could
so cloak her vile feelings beneath the guise of sincerity, that no eye, but
the one she wished to do so, could ever penetrate her designs.  Could
such proficiency in deceit be drawn from a pure heart in an instant, as
by a spell? or was this perfection of duplicity the slow growth of long
continued habit? He feared the latter; and then the remembrance of his
every act of former kindness to her he had loved and trusted, would
bring a blush upon his cheek, for having been such a weak confiding dupe.
He soon persuaded himself, or believed he had done so, that the only
grief he now suffered, was for the loss of his child.
 </p><p> " Why had the wretch," he muttered, " stolen away the only consolation she could have left me! Was it the overpowering love a mother
might feel for her offspring?  Banish the impious thought!  What
mother, loving her child, could bring upon that child the stain of infamy







<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>                    .

that its parent's guilt must stamp upon its future life, if that life were to
be passed with one, revelling in vice and shame. Oh, no ! hatred to
him alone could account for the wicked act." As he was about to call
upon Heaven to blast her with its just vengeance, he raised his eyes and
encountered the lovely innocent features of Alyce in a picture, which
had been painted by the great Holbein, and which was regarded as one
of the most perfect specimens of his art. The sight, added to the recollection of the happiness which he believed to have been his own, when
that picture was painted, completely overcame him, and he wept aloud.
 </p><p>  Young Osborne, who was ever on the watch, fearful of the turn his
master's grief might take, hurried into the apartment.
 </p><p>  " Tear it from the wall !" exclaimed Hewet, covering his eyes with
one hand, as with the other he pointed to the portrait of his wife, " tear
it from the wall-cut it into shreds with your dagger-burn it to ashes
-or cast it deep into the flood-do anything with it, so that you utterly
destroy that lying semblance of a fiend in angel's form !"
 </p><p> Osborn could not resist heaving a sigh, as he looked upon the heavenly
features of Alyce; but knowing that at that moment it were better not
to combat the commands of his agitated master, he hurried away with
the picture, promising its immediate destruction.
 </p><p> After this last paroxysm of the merchant's despair, no mortal eye ever
again witnessed his distress. His whole mind was henceforth, to all
appearance, bound up in his worldly affairs; but inwardly there was a
powerful spring at work, which drew into one focus every action; this
was, his secret determination to be revenged upon the ungrateful cause
of all his sorrow-in fact, to discover, and to kill his wife. To such a
pitch of madness had he wrought himself, that in order that his child
should never fall as her mother had, his next intention was to bestow the
whole of his wealth, and it was already vast, upon some nunnery, with
the condition that she should for ever be kept from the eyes of men.
 </p><p> Did he fulfil these insane fantasies ?-the book of fate is not yet opened
to reveal.
 </p><p> From all the information that had hitherto been obtained, it was pretty
evident that the course the fugitives had taken, was towards Italy.
Hewet, therefore, under pretence of the King's service, now he had
become his Grace's merchant, requiring that he should visit Milan and
Venice, in order to select the most costly stuffs, and finest gold work that
the world could then produce, obtained permission, and safe conducts,
by the King's grace, to enable him to pass through the various states
he must traverse, with speed, and tolerable security. Taking advantage
of one of his own ships, at that moment about to sail for the Adriatic,
he hurriedly prepared for his long and perilous journey.  Osborne was
placed in flll authority at the dwelling upon the Bridge. His other
affairs he left in equally trusty hands; then, with a heart sustained
against an almost insupportable pressure of grief, merely by the unholy
stimulant, a thirst for vengeance, the merchant hastened upon his
melancholy way.
</p><p>  We have often pictured to ourselves, the wonderful diversity of
sights we should behold, had we the power to pull down the external walls of even a single street, the inmates still remaining








                                            <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

unconscious of our intrusive gaze.   What fooleries should we not
discover some of our before-thought wisest capable of enacting?-
what virtues in one place--what vices in the next! A simple wall
here dividing the most abject suffering from the most maddening joy;
the spendthrift here-the miser in the floor beneath.  Here the anxious
mother blessing with her first kiss the new-born child, while there, at
the same moment, the affrighted lost one might be perceived concealing
the body of her strangled babe ! And yet there is an Eye that sees all
this, and more, far more, than even the inventive powers of man could
ever dream of. Were we always to keep this one simple truth before
our own eyes, how far less actions should we perform that we dare not let
the eyes of others gaze at ?  But if so much of varied interest could be
found in the mere visible actions of mortal beings, while viewed without
the actor's knowledge, what endless wonders should we not discover,
could we but look into all human hearts at once, and there behold the
secret workings of hope and fear, of virtue and of vice. How strangely
should we be astounded to find that the weal or woe, the happiness or misery of whole nations, instead of springing from the apparent wisdom or
mistaken views of sagest or weakest counsellors, was far more likely to
be dependent upon the mere smile or frown of some capricious wanton
fair one !-to hear the mitred abbot preaching humility, and know that
inwardly he was revelling in the pomps and vanities of the high station
his hypocrisy had raised him to !-to see the devotee robbing his children
to build some abbey-for religion's sake ? No ! for a monument to his
own ostentatious vanity.  Had we this searching power, we should find
that scarcely one action of a man's whole life ever sprang from the cause
professed; but we should also discover that the mainstring by which the
heart is moved, however long that string might be, however twisted in
and out, or winding through the mysterious secret crannies of the mind,
yet it would ever end in one carefully-hidden spot-SELF! Perhaps,
of all the selfish feelings of human nature, the two most selfish are those
we deem to be the least so-GRIEF and LOVE. The most selfish instance of
grief is that which we endure when we are sorrowing for the loss of some
dear friend, or child, or beloved partner of our joys and cares.  Do
we really grieve because of their death ?  No.  It cannot be because
they have left this weary world for realms of endless joy- that would
be impossible.  Then why do we grieve?    Because we ourselves have
lost the happiness their presence ever brought us-that is the selfish
cause.  The passion, miscalled love, is one entire mass of selfish feelings.
Let but the beloved object tell us she would be happier with another than
with us, if we really loved, that object's happiness would be our only
thought, and we should glory in resigning all our hopes.  Is there one
mortal who ever did or ever could do this ? we fancy not.  The love that
Master Hewet had ever felt for his dear Alyce, was as pure and as intense as mortal was capable of feeling, and the time had been when he
fancied there was no sacrifice he would not submit to for her happiness;
but then he believed she was willing to endure as great a sacrifice for
him. Every kindness a lover bestows he fully expects will be returned,
and that with interest too; if lie find that all is taken, and nothing
given love soon gives up the ghost, or flies to some mere  generous object.







<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>

Master Hewet loved his Alyce so devotedly, that he would willingly have laid down his life for her, but then he would have expected
her to have died in consequence-a lover never kills himself if he thinks
his death would really please his mistress. Thus it was with the merchant   now he thought his wife would wish him dead, it never for a
moment crossed his mind to take his own life; but having had his self-love cruelly wounded, he determined to take hers; and on this, his unhallowed mission, we must leave him for the present.
   </p><p>Time, that untiring old gentleman, who never will be quiet himself, nor
let other people be so, was soberly pursuing his way at the merchant's
house, when suddenly an odd-looking little fellow flew right in his face.
This odd-looking little fellow was a chubby boy, rather saucy in appearance, and has ever been a great favourite with the ladies; he had a pair
of wings upon his shoulders, and was armed with a bow and arrows-his
name was Cupid. He was perfectly naked, which we presume is the
real cause why this odd-looking little fellow is always getting into dark
corners, and ever trying not to be seen, at all events, by more than two at
a time. " Come, move on, move on !" said the odd-looking little fellow
in the most insolent manner, addressing old Time.  " When I want
You to stay, you never will; so move on, old one, or I'll send you a dart
right into your heart, and that's what you won't like; for you know I
can destroy you when I will."
 </p><p>  Time laughed at Love, as he had often done before. " Poor silly fool,"
said the old man, " you always were a fool, and always will be; have
I still to teach you it is Time that destroys Love, not Love Time? I
fly before you, it is true; but that I do because I know you hate to see me
fly; so, since you have come thus suddenly upon this spot, I'll hurry away
faster than ever; for I always fly the swiftest wherever you come the
quickest." And sure enough, old Time flew off like mad; Cupid, to
save trouble, sent two darts at once after him, and where these two
darts fell we will now endeavour to discover.
  </p><p> Osborne, as might be supposed, his master being away, and the whole
weight of the concern resting upon his shoulders, had enough to do, without spending much time upon the education of Billy-the-bridge-shooter,
who was now regularly domesticated in the merchants's house. But as
Osborne was not one to form a good intention and not carry it out, he begun
seriously to think upon some means of getting the youth a proper master,
more particularly as the Bridge-Shooter evinced not only a desire to have
his profound ignorance enlightened, but a great aptness in receiving instruction.
</p><p>   It turned out oddly enough, that the master he chose proved to be a
mistress. She had herself been a pupil of Osborne, and had, for those
days, become a very fair scholar. She could read and write uncommonly
well; as to figures, she was not very great ; she seemed to think that it
was quite enough for girls to do to study their own figures; and the
only arithmetic required by the fair sex was the first rule in Hymen's
arithmetic, where, strange to say, one added to one only makes one.
This rule she had learnt by heart, but as yet had not put it into practice.
The reader will doubtless guess, without much difficulty, that the fair
instructress chosen by Edward Osborne for the guide of Billy-the-bridge

shooter, in his studies, was pretty Flora Gray.  For a long time did she
despair of making any impression upon his " stupid head," as she called
it; and perhaps his tree of knowledge, which afterwards flourished so
well, would have been nipped in the bud, had she not by some unaccountable process, made an impression a little lower down than the
head,-in short, just on the left side of his breast.  The cause of his
making such slow progress at the commencement of his academical labours, arose from a feeling of shame at " a great man "-for youths think
themselves great men at a very early age-" being instructed to read
and write by a little girl." But he very soon began to discover, like
Lord Byron, that fair lips, of all instructors of languages, are the very
best. The two great stumbling-blocks over which every sentence he
attempted to utter, fell and rolled about in the most admired confusion,
were the W's and the V's! "Now, it is a very odd thing," as Flora
sagaciously observed, " that all uneducated people should find any difficulty in pronouncing these two letters in their proper places, while they
do it with perfect ease when placed where they ought not to be."
 </p><p> "But I can't, and I never shall be able to get over those two horrid
little letters," said the Bridge-shooter, with a look of utter despair.
 </p><p> "Nonsense," replied Flora; "now try-say water!"
 " Vorter !" roared out the Bridge-shooter.
 </p><p> " Now say virtue," continued Flora, looking very gravely.
 </p><p> " Wirtue !" said the Bridge-shooter.
 </p><p> " There, you see; you find no difficulty in pronouncing the letters, only
you will put them in the wrong places: adorn your virtue with a V, and
pop your W  into the water, and we shall get on swimmingly."
 </p><p> The poor Bridge-shooter screwed about his lips in all sorts of ridiculous shapes, ere he ventured to exhale his breath in his attempt upon
VIRTUE, and when it did come, the V was about half a yard long; for;
having once caught hold of it, he seemed but little inclined to relinquish
so valuable an acquisition.  "V-e-e-e-e-e-hirtue !" said he,
with a jerk, and then took a long-drawn breath, as if completely overcome
by the effort he had made.
 </p><p> "Excellent, excellent, excellent, indeed," said Flora, with an encouraging smile. Her smile of encouragement, at such a moment, instead
of laughing at his awkward attempt, proved Flora to be an instructress
of consummate tact-those who would teach well, must praise, never
ridicule. So delighted was the poor Bridge-shooter with this, his first
conquest over so formidable a foe, that "virtue" henceforth was for
ever in his mouth, and, we are delighted to add, in his heart too. He
got over the WATER with much less difficulty; here he seemed more in
his element, and by following the same process of elongation, wor-or--
or--r-ter flowed on brilliantly, and he was again encouraged by
Flora's pretty smile. After their lessons, which generally took place an
hour before sunset, in the pretty room behind the upper balcony, overlooking the river, their conversation always reverted to the strange and
wicked conduct of Alyce Hewet.  One evening William, for now Flora
never allowed him to be called by such a vulgar title as Billy-
the-bridge-shooter, observed, " Although I knows-"
 </p><p> "Know," said Flora.

<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>

 </p><p> "Know," said William.
 </p><p> " Yes," said Flora.
 </p><p> "Know," said William.    " Although I know that mother is not a
vitch-I mean witch, sometimes it is werry, very, odd that she does
stumble upon most extraordinary things.  Now   I vunder, wonder,
whether she could by her conjurations, as she calls them, find out for us
what has really become of Dame Hewet and the child. Shall we go and
see the poor old soul, and ax her ?"
 </p><p> " Ask her," said Flora, with a look of some little severity, for she had
already corrected him upon this vulgarism at least a hundred times.
 </p><p> "Well then, Flora, shall we go and ask her ?  You know this is the
eve of St. John, and you have promised that I shall take you about to see
all the gay sights to-night."
 </p><p> Poor Flora felt a sigh rising from the very bottom of her heart, for she
remembered that another used formerly to take her out upon such occasions; but she checked it, and smiling upon her pupil said, "I never
forget my promises, mind you remember yours.  If you make one mistake in the verb you have promised to learn, dread my power."  What
this verb was, we shall by and by explain; but he had already learnt it
by heart; so he felt perfectly easy upon that score.
 </p><p> The eve of St. John the Baptist, in our City's olden time, was an
epoch of vast interest to our forefathers.  The great muster of all the
watches of the City took place then; feastings, bonfires, and revelries of
all kinds flourished to an enormous extent; but upon all these delightful
subjects we shall say but little until we find Flora Gray and William on
their way home again.   The Bridge-shooter, who, now his rags had
vanished and a more becoming apparel substituted, was thought to be
by most an uncommonly nice young man, and had poor Flora never seen
Harry Horton, there is little doubt but she had thought so too. As they
wended their way up Fish-street-hill, they could not resist every now
and then halting for a moment to gaze at the vernal decorations of the
various houses. Many were covered from top to bottom with green
birch, long fennel, and a prodigious quantity of St. John's wort, orpine,
white lilies, and garlands of beautiful flowers; the whole street was
thronged with people busily employed; some bringing out tables to place
before their doors, others carrying faggots; many rolling tar-barrels along
to the appointed spots where those ever-beloved sources of delight, the
bonfires, were to be displayed.  Notwithstanding all they saw, their
minds were too full of the subject of their errand, to let them loiter on
their way; so, having mutually determined to see all that could be seen,
as they returned, they hurried along, passed up Gracechurch-street, then
called Grassechurch-street, turned into Leadenhall-street, and were soon
emerging from  the formidable Aldgate. From  this gate, without the
walls, or ramparts, extending to Bishopsgate, lay a filthy ditch called, as
the spot is to this day, Houndsditch.  It had gained that designation on
account of this portion of the moat having been, from time immemorial,
used as a sort of public cemetery for dead dogs. A low mud wall divided it from the main-road, on the other side of which were a number
of small cottages, with little plots of garden ground attached to them,
all beyond being open country, including Spitalfields, then  a charming

rural Sunday walk, greatly frequented by the citizens.  The whole of
these cottages were inhabited by poor bedridden people, who were
always to be seen lying in their beds close to the open windows, which
were built purposely very low, in order that the inmates might be easily
viewed by the passers by. On the window-sill was spread a clean white
napkin, upon which lay a cross and beads, to indicate that the afflicted
could now do nought but pray. It was the custom of the more affluent
upon holidays, and many other occasions, particularly on Fridays, to
stroll out this way, and while laying in a stock of health for the body,
by deserting for a time the too-densely built city, and breathing a little
fresh air, to add somewhat to the soul's health, by relieving the wants of
their poor afflicted fellow-creatures. In consequence of the ill-usage, and
the dreadful fright the Bridge-shooter's mother had experienced on the
night when the murder of Edward Osborne had been attempted, she had
been seized by a succession of violent fits, which ended in paralysis of
the greater portion of her body. Master Hewet's interest had been
exerted in her behalf, and she was now settled for the rest of her days in
one of those charitably-bestowed cottages. Upon the white napkin lying
in her window, were not only the cross and beads, but, considering its
reputation, an odd accompaniment to such holy gear-the old black cat
was to be seen seated in great dignity. As the Bridge-shooter and
Flora Gray entered Houndsditch from Aldgate, William was surprised,
in looking along the road towards his mother's cottage, to see before her
door a splendid retinue, composed of some twenty gentlemen, all in
oright harness, and mounted on magnificent horses.  Two running pages
were holding the bridle of a superb charger, the saddle of which was
then vacant.   Before he and his pretty companion had proceeded
many paces, a youth, gorgeously attired, came from the cottage, and
mounting the charger, led the way, followed by the twenty horsemen.
As they passed by, the Bridge-shooter had an opportunity of regarding
the youth very minutely, for, on seeing Flora was a pretty girl, the
youth kissed his hand to her, and seemed inclined to make a halt, which
caused a dreadful frown from the poor Bridge-shooter.  This called forth
a laugh from the whole party, who, as they moved on, kept looking back
and imitating their leader's example, all kissing their hands to Flora.
The poor Bridge-Shooter was very much annoyed to observe that Flora,
instead of being terribly angry, as he thought she ought to have been,
raised her head higher than ever,, and seemed to regard their insolence as
anything but disagreeable.
 </p><p> " Oh, lie is coming, Spirit, is he ?" said the old woman to the cat, as
she saw it rise up, elevate its tail, and arch its back, and then begin to
walk along the sill, rubbing itself against the uprights, first on one side,
then on the other, and at last against the Bridge-shooter's shoulder, as
he now leant into the window to kiss his mother.
 </p><p> " I knew you were coming, boy, I knew   you were coming," said
she.
  </p><p>"Well, but I don't think that very wonderful, mother," he replied,
"considering I come every day !"
 </p><p> "Shall I never convince you that I am gifted to know every event
before it happens ?"








<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>                    .

  </p><p> " I should like to be convinced of that," said the lad, " above all things,
 and, in fact, I've come to-night on purpose to put your boasted foresight to
 the test; but before I tell you what I've come about, you must tell me,
 if you do know everything:"-here he made a motion with his hand
 behind him to Flora Gray to keep out of sight-" just you tell me who
 it is I have brought with me ?"
 </p><p>  " Flora Gray," replied the old woman, unhesitatingly.
 </p><p>  The fact was, that in the glass window she saw the reflection of Flora
 Gray standing behind her son; but this little natural aid to her magic
 she kept secret to herself; but her reply had an enormous effect in
 shaking her son's doubts regarding her supernatural powers.
 </p><p>  " Hang me, if you're not right, mother," said the Bridge-shooter,
 drawing Flora forward, "and if you can tell us what we wish to know,
 as truly as you have hit upon this, I'll swear you're a witch to the last
 day of my life,'though they should burn us both for saying so. But I
 say, mother, who was that insolent stripling who just left you ?"
 </p><p>  "One," said the old dame," who has more faith in a witch's words than
 her own fleshand blood has; he has gone away in the fullbelief of my secret
 influence over the spirits of another world-he came for knowledge, and
 I gave it to him-but let that pass-let that pass--'tis useless to try
 to persuade a stone." Saying this she looked very angrily at her son.
  </p><p> Flora softened the old dame wonderfully, by professing implicit belief
in the power of witchcraft; but, indeed, nearly the whole population of
the kingdom had faith in it, excepting, perhaps, those who professed it.
 </p><p>  Had the Bridge-shooter not been her son, and thus too familiarly
mixed up with the absurdities of the deceit, he, most likely would have
given credit to all she said, as easily as many others did; and even as it
was, he, at times, felt his disbelief terribly shaken, by the chance hits
she was fortunate enough to make.
  </p><p> As all other attempts to discover the fates of Alyce and the child, had
failed, he thought there could be no harm, even if there were no good,
in just pleasing his old mother so far, as to ask her aid. Flora ncw
told the old woman the cause of their visit, but the old dame pretended to
know it all beforehand, and said she had been nearly the whole day trying
with the cards to discover the truth.  "I have failed as yet," she said,
but the spell is working-the spell is working !"
 </p><p>  At this moment they were all made to start, by the sudden friskines: of
the cat, who, jumping down, flew round the room, darted up stairs, was
heard bounding about the loft above; then again rushed down, again
few round the room, when, having satisfied her volatile propensity, she
suddenly seated herself quietly as before upon the window-sill. This
mad kind of freak is not at all uncommon in the feline race, but the old
woman turned it, as indeed she did almost everything else, to her own
purpose, and exclaimed, " Twenty times to-day has my Spirit been thus
wonderfully moved; she will yet bring me the secret she is searching for:
will you not my Spirit ?"
  </p><p>The cat passed over to her mistress, and began rubbing her head
against the old woman's ear, for all the world as though she had bean
whispering some secret to her.
 </p><p> Flora quite trembled, for seeing this, she began to have but little doubts,







                                           <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>

if any at all, as to the locality whence the cat had come, and she now
felt inclined to make her visit as short as possible, fearing that the old
gentleman might come to claim his imp, but the dame insisted upon
trying the cards once more. She took up a worn-out pack, or pair, as
they were then called, and spreading them before her on the bed, said,
</p><p>" Every time I open this book of fate, there do I find the Queen of
Hearts, meaning dame Alyce--"
  </p><p> "She was indeed the Queen of Hearts, of all hearts, until this sad
affair," said Flora, sighing deeply.
  </p><p> " Before her is a knave, and behind her is another; this is the twentieth time they have fallen in the same position-the Knave of Diamonds
and the Knave of Clubs."
 </p><p> Oh," said Flora, " the Knave of Diamonds is plain enough, that
means the wicked Sir Filbut, who has caused us all our trouble--"
  </p><p> " And himself some too," said the old woman, " for see, he's turned
upside down, and standing upon his head; that speaks but badly for the
comfort of his own position: but who know you that would answer to
the Knave of Clubs ?"
 </p><p> " If they were 'prentice clubs," exclaimed William, " I should say it
means Harry Horton"
</p><p>  Poor Flora blushed at hearing the Bridge-shooter speak thus slightingly of one she had regarded with tenderness, but even she had began to
have her suspicions as to his true character, but she ventured to say,
" That it was impossible he could have had ought to do with Sir Filbut's
wickedness, for there had been moments when she really believed that
Harry was more than half in love with dame Alyce himself."
  </p><p>"Was he, girl?" enquired the would-be witch;" yet the cards speak as
much, and they never deceive; but enough for one night-enough for
one night; but the spell is working-the spell is working.  As you reenter the city, do so by the Postern Gate, the road to it will lead you
past the Nunnery of the Minories; ask for the blind girl, Eoline, and
give her this little wooden cross-she well knows my meaning. I have
seen strange things in the clouds to-day: tell Edward Osborne, on his
life not to be away from home to-morrow; he is sought by those who
may smooth the rough road he has to follow for many and many a year
to come; remember, if I am a witch, the strange visitor to Edward
Osborne, I now fortel, will visit him to-morrow-there is much will
happen soon-much, much, much !"
 </p><p> " Mother says much," observed the Bridge-shooter to Flora, as they
took their way back again, " but we have not gained much for our
trouble."
  </p><p>" But what can she want," said Flora, " of the blind beauty of the
nunnery; surely one brought up in such a holy place, can have nothing
in common with witchcraft."
 </p><p> " I don't know that," replied the Bridge-shooter, "there are strange
stories getting about, concerning all sorts of nuns, particularly the nuns
of St. Clair. Some say they are no better then they should be, or, rather,
not quite so good as they ought to be. But never mind such useless
things as nuns, and if you will let me, I will just run through the verb
you last set me."








<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>                   .

  </p><p>" What verb ?" enquired Flora; " I have quite forgotten which it
was."
 </p><p> " I shall never forget it," said the Bridge-shooter; " I never found
anything half so easy to remember-it seemed to come quite naturally."
  </p><p>"And what was it ?" again enquired Flora.
  </p><p>"The verb-to love !" answered William, with a peculiar expression,
though he imagined it was a verb that could be conjugated by the eyes
alone. " It begins, I love, and the plural is we love; that's the present
tense."
  </p><p>" Is it?" said Flora; "then it must be an imperfect tense, I'm
sure."
 </p><p> "Indeed, it's the present," said William, quite innocently.
  </p><p>"With you it may be," replied the little coquette; " but to me, it
sounds much more like thefuture. But I had better set you a different
lesson to learn."
  </p><p>" You will set me none," said the youth, ," that will make half the
impression that this one does upon my mind; indeed, I have thought of
nothing else since you gave it to me to learn. Oh, Flora, I wish I dared
add one little pro-pro-noun, I think you say it is, to the present tense
of that verb-and then I'd say-I-love-you !"
 </p><p> " For shame, William," said Flora; " we must give up our studies if
you talk thus; and know, sir, that I do not love you, nor do I ever intend to do so."
 </p><p> " I know all that, Flora," replied the Bridge-shooter, "nor do I ask you
to do it. All I crave, is to be allowed to love you, not because you are
pretty, for every one could love you for that, but because you are good
and kind to those who require your smile and aid. I have never heard
you say a cross word to mortal; and even now, how often do you speak
in kindness of that poor lost creature, the merchant's wife. These,
Flora, are the things that make me love you-not your pretty face or
pretty form."
 </p><p> Now, if the poor Bridge-shooter had studied the sex for a thousand
years, he could not have hit upon a method more likely to win the good
esteem of her he wooed, than the one he, by nature, was pursuing.
While denying that he loved her for her beauty, he was still covertly
telling her how beautiful he thought her; and yet, even that beauty was
nought to be compared to the amiability he discovered hidden beneath
it.  Why, this was the quintessence of art; and why ? because, as the
ridiculous is said to be within a step of the sublime, so is the perfection
of art within an inch of nature; then, if consummate art can be so
powerful, what must nature be ?  why, resistless! And as in the case
of the poor Bridge-shooter, all being nature, the effect of his few heart-
felt words made more impression upon the mind of Flora Gray than had
the years of flattery bestowed upon her charms by Harry Horton. One
thing alone was wanting to make the Bridge-shooter's success complete,
and chance almost immediately filled up the measure of his hopes, for
just after Flora's heart had been so powerfully assailed by the youth at
her side, whom should they meet but Harry Horton, now splendidly
attired, arm in arm with a man much older than himself, but equally
gay in his habiliments.  The elder was a tall powerful man, whose face








                                           <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>

 was nearly hidden by a profusion of whiskers, beard, and long moue
 stache. Flora's old feelings for Horton for one instant filled her breast,
 and she made an impulsive start forward to meet her former flatterer;
but he, looking her full in the face, seemed not to know one so humble
in station, and turning his head away, passed on. The man of whiskers
and of beard had started too, but this was a start of that nature which
we make at suddenly finding ourselves in presence of the last person we
would have met.  He fixed his dark protruding eyes upon the Bridge-
shooter, and scowling fiercely upon him, vanished with Horton in the
crowd. So astonished had the Bridge-shooter been at seeing a perfect
stranger, as he thought him, gaze at him thus, that he had not heeded
the agitation which Horton's contemptuous slight of poor Flora had
thrown her into. She looked after her false lover, and felt as though she
could have sunk into the earth for very shame at herself, for ever having
thought of such a worthless wretch. She said not a word, but clung tightly
to the arm of William, and pressed it to her heart. She hoped he had not
felt the pressure, for she feared the affection she from that moment determined to bestow upon him, might be but the offspring of revenge, and
not the pure offering of her heart, which she wished it to be.  To hide
the mortification she really felt, she put on an air of exaggerated mirth,
and laughed quite loudly at the idea of such " a magpie," as she called
Horton, " strutting about in his peacock's feathers." But, poor soul!
when she returned to her own chamber, she gave way to one long bitter
flood of tears, and Horton was torn from her heart for ever.
 </p><p>  When they had arrived at the Convent of the Minories, they learnt
 that Eoline, the blind girl, had gone to fulfil her usual evening duty, by
 carrying small cakes and flowers from the nunnery farm to the poor bed-
 ridden people of the Houndsditch cottages. Upon these errands of
 charity she was usually accompanied by her brother, as she called him,
 Willy, the Cripple of the Bridge-gate tower.  Now, Eoline was fair-
 fair as blooming May, and the Cripple had eyes to see and feel that
 fairness; but Eoline was blind, born blind, and could not see her
 friend's deformities; she saw but his kindness through the eyes within
 her heart, and that to her was beautiful. Oft would she say, as they
 strolled along together, "I wonder, to those who have what you call
 sight, what the difference can be between ugliness and beauty ?"
</p><p>   "The difference between myself and you," the Cripple would reply;
 "the difference between a devil and an angel !"
  </p><p> "Hush !" said Eoline, trembling; "know you the meaning of the
 words you utter ? No, Willy, no. The wicked spirits, they tell me,
 are all deformity, because they are wicked; you are all goodness, at
 least to me; you, therefore, cannot be deformed, whatever our ugly
 nuns may say-I call them ugly because they are always unkind to me,
 and quarrel with each other-so you see I know, Willy, what ugliness
 really is, although I have no eyes; do I not ?"
 </p><p>  " Poor child !" said the Cripple, " you will never know what real ugliness is, for you will never see me."
 </p><p>  " I see you often," was her innocent reply, "often and often.  You
 never sing but I see you in my ears; and oh, you are so lovely !"






<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>                    .
 </p><p> "Oh, oh! ha, ha! he, he-       !" laughed the Cripple, at hearing
himself thus flattered.
 </p><p> " Oh, do not do that !" ejaculated the blind girl, placing her hands upon
her ears; " you frighten me when you do that.  It seems as if another
being were standing by, a wicked one, scoffing at me for my poor blind
folly, in saying the foolish things I do. But I am blind, Willy, blind--
and it seems to me that all wisdom lies in the eyes, not in the brain; so
do not scoff at me for want of wisdom-I was born blind."
 </p><p> The poor Cripple felt that he would cut out his tongue rather than
again utter that discordant laugh; and although he knew he had to fight
against all-powerful nature, yet he determined to combat till he conquered-such are the wild achievements love will make mankind attempt.
 </p><p> After the perusal of these last few lines, the reader will not be surprised when we state that the twin shaft which Cupid fired after old Time
a few pages back, had fallen upon the heart of the Cripple of the Bridgegate tower. He dared to love, for he knew that she whom he idolized
could never see his misshapened form, and would not therefore ridicule
him as others did. Ridicule is the death of love.
 </p><p> Flora and the Bridge-shooter left the cross for Eoline with the portress
at the convent gate, and as the night was now fast setting in, they
moved quickly forward to enter the city by the postern gate; they
strolled through Tower-street, now gaily lighted up, then into Escheppe
(Eastcheap), gayer still, which brought them soon once more to Fishstreet, now a scene of perfect magnificence. The standing watch were
taking their stations, all habited in bright harness, looking like burnished
men of silver, from the reflection of the bonfires, roaring at the
corner of every street.  "Bonfire"-a word formed one half of French,
the other Saxon, meaning good fire-was lighted for two most worthy
purposes. It was anciently at these good fires the neighbours came together, and those who had hitherto been enemies, were, by the intercession of others, made to shake hands and become sworn and loving friends.
The bonfire also had the power of purifying the air, and thus to a degree
preventing plagues and deadly fevers. At every door, that is, of the
richer citizens, was placed a table, well supplied with sweet bread and
goodly drinks, the worthy owners inviting their neighbours, and strangers
passing by, to come and sit awhile in unconstrained familiarity, to make
merry, and praise God for the benefits he had bestowed upon them. Not
only were the houses, particularly the doorways, adorned with leaves and
flowers, but glass lamps were' hung out in great profusion, and which
burnt the whole night through. In some places, huge branches of iron
curiously. wrought, were hung out, upon which hundreds of lamps
were alight at once, so that nearly the whole city, by the bonfires, lamps,
and burning cressets, became almost as light as day. But all this brilliancy was nothing to what was soon to follow, we mean the procession of
</p><p>" THE MARCHING WATCH," and a magnificent procession it certainly
was. It passed from the little Conduit at Paule's Gate, to West
Cheape, then by the Stocks through Cornhill, by Leadenhall to Aldgate,
then back down Fenchurch Street, by Grasse Church, about Grasso-







                                             <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>
 Church Conduit, and up Grasse-Church Street into Cornhill, and thence
 into West Cheape again.
   </p><p> To light the watch upon its way, there were no less than seven-
 hundred cresset bearers, besides the two hundred and forty city constables,
 every one of whom also bore a cresset; each cresset bearer was attended
 by a man, carrying a bag containing fuel, so that the cresset bearers and
 their fuel-men, alone amounted to nearly two thousand.  The cresset
 was a sort of open-work iron basket, fixed upon the end of a long pole,
 and filled with coals, or other burning materials.
  </p><p>  The men wore straw hats, in the front of which was a painted badge
 according to the company to which he belonged; besides their pay, they
 were all entitled to a breakfast in the morning. The remaining part or
 the marching watch, contained about two thousand more persons, many
 of them old soldiers, who acted as captains, sergeants, &amp;c.; then there
 were the whifflers, or fifers, drummers, and standard-bearers, sword,
 players, and trumpeters, the demi-lances, mounted upon their magnificent horses; amongst these, the Bridge-shooter and Flora recognised
 the young spark, and his twenty gaily-attired friends; then there were,
 as usual, the morris-dancers, and various pageants, or shows, drawn upon
 wheels; next came a hundred and twenty constables all attired in bright
 harness, all of them wearing a large scarlet cloak, called a jornet, and a chain
 of gold; then came the mayor mounted on horseback, the sword-bearer
 before him, also mounted, and in fair armour; these were preceded by
 the minstrels and city waits, the mayor's officers for his guard, in
 livery of worsted, or say jackets, party-coloured. About him, too,
 were his footmen and torch-bearers, and two henchmen on strong horses
 followed close behind.
 </p><p>   The sheriff's watches came the next, but not so large in number as
 the mayor's, for the mayor had besides his giant, three pageants, while
 the sheriffs had but two, but they also had a giant each, with harnessed
 men, that is, men fully armed, in great numbers.
  </p><p>  The reader will be at little loss to picture to his imagination the
 gorgeous, but extraordinary scene, which such a moving mass of light and
 splendour must have created.  So monstrously expensive were these
 civic displays, that three years afterwards they were entirely put down
 by royal mandate.
  </p><p>  Many were the tables placed without the doors, at which the Bridge-
shooter and his fair companion were compelled to take their seats, now
  beside some princely merchant's dame, now by a wandering friar or a
beggar; for on St. John's eve all were supposed to be friends and equals.
  and none, without offence, could refuse the invitation proffered.
 </p><p>   When Flora and her new lover had completely tired themselves out.
  by seeing the procession pass at least half a dozen times, by running down
  little by-streets and alleys, in the geographical knowledge of which Billy
  the-bridge-shooter had for some years been very great, and then catching
  the marching watch in a new spot, they took one more glance a
  the two principal streets, Fish  Street and Thames Street, and they
  returned towards their home upon the Bridge.  The gaieties and decora
  tions here were not to be despised, although this was no road by which
  the'watch would pass. Many a well-stored table stood before the open







  <pb id="p.110" n="110"/>                    .

  door of more than one dwelling there.  At one of these were seated
  Master Checklocke, and his two loving friends, Catchemayde and Silkworm.   Cromwell's good ale had done its work so well, that now they
  not only swore they loved each other, but were in love with all the world
  this they endeavoured to prove, by insisting upon kissing Flora Gray,
  but, being a little the worse for liquor, the Bridge-shooter good humouredly
  managed to receive all their embraces, instead of the maiden, and then
  left them  in a furious quarrel about whose wife she really should be.
  Flora and her swain as they entered their door, looked back, and saw
  the three friends embracing at once, and then fall over the table into the
  middle of the road.
 </p><p> Edward Osborne had already returned home; they acquainted him
  with the witch's prophecy, that he would have a strange visitor the next
  day, and then all retired to rest.

 </p><p>THE war against the monastic orders had now set in with overwhelming
 fury; many monasteries had already been suppressed; commissioners had
 been appointed to take possession of these, and to prepare measures for the
 seizure of others.  The enquirers into the lives and habits of the monks
 and nuns, were let loose over the whole land, and hunted down their
 victims in couples.  The villanies and atrocities committed by these
 worthless wretches, employed for the purpose by the government, were
 in many cases too horrible to be recorded.
 </p><p>  As a fair sample of the kind of persons engaged upon this religious
investigation, as it was called, we may take Harry Horton and his
coadjutor, who turned out to be no other than the brother of the Blear-
eyed Bully.   This man had, for a long time before, been employed as
one of Henry's foreign spies, and it was in returning from his labours in
ferreting out some of the designs of the potentates abroad, that he had
discovered his dead brother, after the execution at Billingsgate.  It was
impossible for Horton to have been linked to one more congenial with his
own feelings. They possessed the like dispositions for cunning villany,
an equal disregard for every virtuous or honourable sentiment, added
to a total absence of all feeling for the sufferings of others.  There
was another point upon which they were perfectly agreed, and that was
an unalterable hatred to Edward Osborne. Horton's new ally was
called Beltham Spikely, and it was he who had scowled so blackly upon
the Bridge-shooter on St. John's Eve. He had completely disguised his
visage by allowing his whiskers, beard, and long moustache to grow,
which they did most luxuriantly. This was more a whim on his part
than a necessary precaution to avoid detection, for such a trifle as torturing

 within an inch of death a youth humble as Osborne, was not
 likely to be regarded in any very serious light by those in power, and
 who at present were in want of all the assistance they could gain from
 tools as unprincipled as was the Blear-eyed Bully's twin  brother.
 Although there never can be an adequate excuse set forth for the course
 pursued by Henry the Eighth in the spoliation of the religious houses of
 this kingdom, yet it must be confessed that the still-increasing depravity
 of those whose lives should have been holy, had reached such a pitch,
 that it was no longer possible to repair the rotten fabric-the only method
 was to pull it down altogether, and erect a new one in its stead. In
 doing this, justice was completely set aside. The King, the now supreme
 head of the church-the Pope's own dear " Defender of the Faith,"
 was he who laid the axe to the very root; he willed it, and it must be
 done. Neither he, nor those about him, cared much how that doing was
 accomplished. To tempt the heads of the various houses to resign
 quietly their lands and wealth, promises of protection and rewards were
 lavished upon all, but these promises were never intended to be fulfilled,
 and even protection to the aged was but seldom accorded. All monks
 under twenty-four years of age were absolved from their vows, no provision made for their support, but were sent adrift at once upon the
 world, to beg, or steal, or starve, as the chance might be.  The elder
 portion were allowed to make choice of freedom, or, if they preferred the
 monastic life, they were drafted off in small numbers into other houses,
 that might for the season be still allowed a short existence.  The most
 helpless of the religious orders were the poor nuns, unused to work, un -
 friended by the world, because the world was now being taught that the
 nuns were but so many vicious impostors. They were turned out from
 their former homes to wander where they would, with no further provision " but a single common gown a-piece."
 </p><p>  There was another cause of great suffering, which was that arising
from the general poor, who had formerly been relieved at the gates of the
various monasteries and convents.  Finding these sources of obtaining
their daily bread suddenly cut off the streets in every town, the roads in
every direction, soon became thronged with these wandering starving
beggars. We may easily imagine, too, what vices were enacted by these
thousands of monks and nuns being thrown hopelessly upon the
world-many following vicious lives by choice, many driven to it by
absolute despair.  Terrible scenes frequently took place midst riot and
even bloodshed, when some wealthy house, more notorious than others
for its reputation of vile practices, was thrown open to the eyes of the
world, and all the hidden deceits laid bare, the miraculous-working
images brought out into the main road, and after being made to go
through their ingeniously-contrived motions, amidst the laughter and
ridicule of the very people who, but a short time before, had viewed their
workings with amazement and with awe, they were broken up and
burnt.  The more the crowd found they had been so long deceived, the
greater was the resentment felt against the juggling contrivers of the
cheat; and in some instances the priests paid the forfeit of their crimes
by being murdered on the spot.
 </p><p> The nunnery which now came under the especial guardianship of






<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>                   .

Horton and his companion, was the Convent of the Minories. The nuns
of St. Clair had long held a reputation for great beauty, and their chapel
was always thronged, in consequence of the music being performed in a
manner far superior at their religious house to that at most others, even
of greater pretensions.  One of the principal causes of this reputation in
music, arose from the beauty of the voices of the Cripple of the Bridge-
gate tower and that of Eoline, " The blind maid of St. Clair," as she was
usually called. The Cripple, from being truly ugly and deformed, was
regarded as a privileged being at the convent, and, although a man, was
allowed the full range, not only of the farm attached, but also of the interior of the nunnery. He was a great favourite with the inmates, because
he used to bring them all the news of the external world, and then would
sing his sweetest songs to amuse them for whole evenings together.
Now, it is not because a human being may be born without beauty,
that he must be born also without feeling.  It is true that, generally
speaking, those utterly devoid of personal attraction, soon acquire so
completely a control over their apparent passions, as to keep, at all
events, from the world's eye, their inward feelings.  This arises from
that all-powerful check upon man's words and actions-the fear of ridicule.  The poor Cripple would never have dared to own, even to himself,
that he loved, had he not fancied he had found in Eoline's blindness an
excuse for venturing to give way to the sweetest of all passions. He
knew  the fascination of his voice, and he also knew that Eoline
could hear; a joy extreme was his whenever she owned she loved to hear
it.  Now, to those even who possess the blessing of sight, the passion of
love arises generally more from  a contemplation of the beauties of an
ideal being, than from those which really stand out in form material before
the human eye. The maiden while alone, if she but think upon her lover,
'tis then he makes a far deeper impression upon her heart, than when
he stands in form confessed before her.  If this be true in the case of
those who have the gift of sight, how much more intensely must this
power of the ideal have acted upon one in the benighted state of Eoline.
She had created a being, in her mind's eye, of such perfection, that the
most consummate of mortal beauty would have shrunk abashed from
being placed in hopeless comparison. Her two most powerful senses were
those of hearing and of touch.  Now, it so happened, that the Cripple's
hand was almost feminine, and when it came in contact with her own,
its tender pressure thrilled to her heart; so did his voice when he sang.
Thus, then, the blind and lame became sworn lovers, whose truth was
likely to endure as long as their lives should last. She was beautiful, but
then she had no eyes to read the admiration her charms created. He
was ugly, but she saw it not; and that very ugliness was her safeguard
against his being tempted from his truth to her, for all who saw him,
loathed him.
   </p><p>Before we enter upon the strange occurrences which were soon to take
place within the Convent of the Minories, we must cast a glance backwards, as far as that day upon which the saintly Father Brassinjaw was
trotting along the road, mounted upon his little, fat, long-eared mule. It
may be remembered he was journeying to the lonely cottage in which
Horton had for a time taken up his abode; and he trotted along with a








                    <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>

  breast boiling over with saintly indignation against both Horton and the
  lovely Alyce, for their daring to keep from their confessor so great a
  secret as the one they endeavoured to hide. So well did Brassinjaw play
  his cards, that Horton was completely taken off his guard, for he believed
  the priest knew much more of the truth than he really did; for, in fact,
  he knew nothing, but he guessed a good deal. Horton soon found, that
  unless he allowed Father Brassinjaw a good half of the spoil he intended
  to gather, he should have to relinquish the whole, and must himself be
  brought to a fearful reckoning. He agreed to all the father's pretty bold
  demands, which he made, as he said, to show that such duplicity as that
  of Horton was not to go unpunished by the Church's sense of justice.
  Horton succumbed the more readily, as he required the services of Brass-
  injaw to visit the Blear-eyed Bully, and endeavour to find out whether
  he would die without betraying his accomplices. It was settled with
  regard to Sir Filbut, that they should fleece him as thoroughly as possible, and that Alyce, for reasons which Horton kept to himself, should
  not be allowed to guess that Brassinjaw ever for a moment suspected
  her.
  </p><p>  After the execution of the Bully, Horton came in contact with the
  Bully's second self, his twin-brother; it was arranged that they would
  all three act in concert. Spikely not only served the king as a spy, but
  robbed him as a smuggler. He had a vessel of his own, in which he was
  ever passing backwards and forwards from and to the Continent, orders
  being given that his boat was not to be too closely watched, enabled him
  to export from this kingdom vast quantities of that strictly-prohibited
  article, the staple of our land-wool. The most usual method employed
  to deceive the officers of the customs, was to pack the wool in beer casks,
  and so carelessly was the duty of examination performed, that a little
  yeast being smeared about the bunghole, was deemed precaution quite
  sufficient to prevent detection.
  </p><p>  Sir Filbut Fussy was tempted to pay a large sum for this vessel to
  convey him and Alyce, and all his valuables, to Italy; and as it was not
  known when the fortunate hour might arrive, it was settled that all Sir
  Filbut's goods and chattels should be shipped by degrees, and then all
  things kept in readiness, so that the moment Sir Filbut stept his foot
aboard, the sails might be set, and thus the deeply-plotted villany consummated.
</p><p>  Brassinjaw agreed to the attempt to drive Osborne out of his mind by
fright, and it was his own scheme that Spikely, being so like his dead
brother, should buy his clothes from the executioner, and pass for the ghost
of the Bully.  The reader may remember the scene in the chapel of St.
Thomas of the Bridge, and the supernatural disappearance, as Osborne
at the time, believed it to be, of the ghost, as it descended the stairs to
the crypt below, and which Brassinjaw had declared he never saw, although he ascended at the very moment.   The more secure Horton
and his companion believed themselves to be, the less did they feel inclined to go shares with Brassinjaw, and they were ever trying to chouse
him out of his proportion of the profits. This was a great want of wisdom on their parts, for clever as they might deem themselves to be, they







<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>
should have remembered that a priest in those days was not one very
likely to sleep with more than one eye closed at a time; and as to
cunning deceit, Brassinjaw was a man who could have given either of
them half a dozen points, and have still won the game easily. He agreed
to everything they dictated, but he kept a careful watch, and noted
down every attempt to catch him, intending one day to make each lay
a trap for themselves. Greatly was the saintly Father Brassinjaw perplexed to know how  to make the most of the secrets he possessed. He
already foresaw  the religious storm that was threatening to burst upon the
heads of him and all of his fraternity.  He had already collected a good
round sum from his devotees, and by taking out the real jewels from the
offerings to his church, and substituting false ones in their places. His
excuse to himself for this was, that they might not fall into the power
of the sacrilegious thieves, who were now beginning to be sent over the
country by the King, to seize upon all the valuables they could lay their
hands upon. Some of his other schemes we shall shortly have to
disclose.
 </p><p>  Horton had proved himself such an adept at finding out the vices
of the poor monks and nuns, who fell beneath his hands, that Cromwell
bestoweed on him almost unlimited power over all but the lives of the
poor creatures intended to be sacrificed.  He and his companion
now took the affairs of the Nunnery of the Minories into their
most serious consideration; and having extorted from  the sisterhood all they could by threats or promises, they still felt convinced that
more secrets lay hidden within the bosoms of many of the nuns, and -
that if they could but make them speak out, there would be, at least
glorious amusement, if not great gain for themselves in a worldly point
of view. A diabolical idea entered the head of Horton, which made
Spikely roar with laughter, and so taken were they both with the
glorious thought, that they hurried off at once to put it into execution.
The Abbess was away from home when they arrived; for this they
were rather glad, so putting on a look of mock gravity, they summoned
the nuns before them and for a time, carried on the examination in as
serious a tone, as their inward determination for mischief would allow
them to assume. Presently the grand scheme was to be carried out,
the wine cellars were thrown open, the wine brought forth, and the poor
nuns compelled to drink until they became mad from intoxication. Some
laughed, some sang, others danced about, not knowing what they did,
encouraged by the applause and laughter of the two fiends who witnessed
this horrid scene. Some, who were less stupified by the effects of the
wine they had drunk, fell down in fits of weeping upon the floor. The
scene was now becoming too dreadful to describe, when the Abbess
returned, leading by the hand the blind girl, Eoline.
 </p><p> Who can portray in words, the feeling of despair, of rage, of shame, that
filled the breast of the Abbess, as she beheld the fiendish scene. " Ah,
ah! my beauty I" exclaimed Horton, as he saw for the first time the
lovely Eoline, "come hither, my bright-eyed fair one,"-he knew not
that she was blind,-for although usually her eyes were gently closed,
yet, when alarmed, the lids uprose, and then those eyes were beautiful

  to look at, though sightless--" come hither, and sit upon my knee," said
  he, "and drink confusion to yon old hag, the Lady Abbess."
   </p><p> "Confusion to the Lady Abbess !" exclaimed some of the nuns, who
  had been compelled to say those words a dozen times before.
    </p><p>" Horror !" ejaculated the Abbess. " Eoline, to your cell, to your cell,
  or fly the place altogether- "
   </p><p> " Indeed, but she does not !" roared out Horton, " she shall be my
  own particular angel-I've suddenly fallen in love with her."  So saying he rose, as if to approach Eoline.
   </p><p> "Touch her not !" exclaimed the Abbess; "if you lay but a finger on
  her, I will utter words, that, monster as you are, shall make your hand
  to wither and fall powerless."
   </p><p> " I'm too much up to your miracles, my old hag, to heed the pretended power of words, although uttered by a holy Lady Abbess.  One
  kiss I will have, if but to put your vaunted juggling to the test."
    The Abbess seized his outstretched arm, and hurriedly whispered into
  his ear a few words, when suddenly he turned, and gazed upon the poor
  blind Eoline with look aghast. He stood for a second motionless, his
  eyes then wandered about, his lips moved silently, as if his memory was
  at work, and he was repeating to himself all which that mysterious agent
  of the mind, was bringing up from her hidden stores; at last he exclaimed-" If what you say be true, and I believe it is so, you have
  given up a secret which to me is worth her weight in gold.  You are
  right-right--she is safe from me, and mind, that on your life, you keep
  her safe from others.  If you play me false, there's not a limb of one of
  you, that shall not by the rack be made to bend the wrong way easier
  than the right.  If you would save the miserable roof that shelters you,
  serve me, and serve me truly.  It will not be long before you know
  my determination; but I have other things to do before I can look to this,
in the way I must. Keep the secret still, until I have determined what
course you must pursue."
 </p><p> The two monsters now     left the nunnery; the moment they were
  gone, the few nuns who had fled from fear, upon the approach of Horton
  and his myrmidon, and had taken shelter in the farm belonging to the
  convent, now returned, and with kindly care took charge of the poor
  creatures, who still were acting madly under the influence of the intoxicating draughts they had been compelled to swallow.
    The Abbess sat musing for a few minutes, while working her fingers
  rapidly through her beads; she wept for a moment, then dashing away
  the tears, started up as if a sudden determination had seized upon her
  mind. Late as was the hour of night, she dispatched messengers in
  various directions to find out Father Brassinjaw; they were commanded
  to bring him straightway to her, as she must consult with him on an
affair of the deepest import. One of the servants of the farm was then
sent to command the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-tower not to lose a
moment, but to hasten to the convent.
 </p><p> The scenes that had just taken place, had thrown the whole establishment into the wildest excitement.  "Child," said the abbess to the
blind girl, " bless thy want of sight ! better, far better be without eyes,
than having eyes, be forced to look upon the sights I have this night







<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>                     .

witnessed: but they are but the endings of bad beginnings; years may
roll on-years of fancied security; but there is an ever-invisible working
of fate that never sleeps. I would confess thee to-night, child. I have
deep reasons for the act. Follow me to the chapel, and at the altar's foot,
mind that you answer truly every question I shall put."
 </p><p> The Abbess having whispered some orders to those about her, left the
hall; she bore in her hand a lamp; this was the only light within the
chapel, and dark and melancholy did it look. The Abbess placed the
lamp upon the altar, then kneeling down, murmured a long prayer.
This ended, she confessed the blind girl, Eoline, whose answers appeared
to give great comfort to the mind of the Abbess, who, at the conclusion
of a long string of interrogatories, kissed her forehead, saying, " All may
yet be well, at least for thee; would that my passions were as calm, as
pure as thine !"
 </p><p> The Father Brassinjaw now hurried into the chapel, and, for a wonder
at so late an hour, was sober. He was soon made acquainted with all
that had happened, and, notwithstanding the sanctity of the spot, he let
loose to his feelings, and called down a good round curse upon the head of
Harry Horton, for daring to violate a region he regarded as peculiarly his
own. The Abbess, leaving Eoline praying at the altar, retired with the
reverend hypocrite to a distant part of the chapel, to consult with him on
her intended project. They debated the subject warmly, but in the end
the saintly Father Brassinjaw fell entirely into the views of the Abbess,
who, ringing her little silver bell, summoned the inmates of the sacred
pile to prayer. Eoline was ordered to retire, and do whatever she was
bidden. Those whose duty it was, immediately commenced lighting up
the chapel, which, in an incredibly short space of time, changed from that
of gloom to brightest splendour. The candles upon the altar, ranging
from the length of a few inches to that of several feet, were all ignited,
and gave a peculiar beauty to the midnight scene; not a lamp was left
unlighted. The incense sent forth its peculiar holy vapour throughout the
sacred aisles, and all the appliances of the gorgeous style of worship connected with the Roman Catholic Church, were called into requisition. Father Brassinjaw put on his sacred robes, and had just performed his first
genuflection before the altar, when Willy the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-
tower entered the holy precincts. He was about to take his usual place
as a singer, when he was astonished at being beckoned by the Abbess to
approach her, and still more so, when he heard her thus address him.
" Be not surprised at this unusual call, or rather, let not surprise (for
surprised you must be) so bind up the free will of your brain, that you
repent to-morrow of the act you are called upon to perform to-night,
that is, if your inclination jump with the chance that this life's strange
adventures now present you.  Long have I known, that notwithstanding your hopelessness in such a case, that you have loved !" The Cripple
was indeed astonished, for though he could not disguise the truth from
himself, he had studiously done so, as he thought, from the eyes of the
scoffing world; but he was still more astonished as the Abbess proceeded
in her address.  " The object of your love," she said, "is Eoline!"
Here all present, excepting the speaker and the priest, appeared as surprised as did the poor Cripple; but when she added, " Will you consent








                                            <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>

  to marry her ?" he knew not whether he lived or was in another
 world, or whether all he saw and heard was the strangely-born offspring
 of a dream. He rubbed his eyes, his ears; he looked around in wild
 amaze; then falling upon his knees, exclaimed, " Oh! holy, holy saints,
 have pity, have pity upon a wretch, and free him from the witchcraft
 that now surrounds him! Speak, speak to my soul, and tell me what
 his means !"
 </p><p>  The Abbess, taking him by the hand, said calmly, " It means nor more
 nor less than what my words import. Are you willing, from your own
 free agency, unbidden, unconstrained, to take to wife the blind girl,
 Eoline ?"
   </p><p>" How can such a deformed, degraded thing as I, say yes ? And yet
 were I but like to other men, and she could love me, nor racks, nor tortures, nor seeing of death itself, should make my lips say no!"
  </p><p> " I knew as much," replied the Abbess; then again sounding her little
 silver bell, all the servants of the nunnery farm entered the chapel, and,
 amidst several nuns, the Cripple beheld the fair star of all his heart's most
 secret hopes, enter the chapel. She was now attired in white, and over
 her head, reaching to the ground, hung down a superb veil. She answered as warmly to the questions put to her, as he had done, regarding
 her free acceptance of the Cripple for her husband. Upon this the Abbess
 lay great stress, and called all present to witness that no force had been
 employed. Not an act that could render the marriage lawful and indissoluble, was omitted; every one present either signed their names, or
 made their crosses, as witnesses to the holy contract; and thus to the
 heart's joy, but surprise unfathomable of both, did the Cripple of the
 Bridge-gate-tower and the lovely blind girl, Eoline, find themselves suddenly man and wife.
  </p><p> " For reasons well known to ourself, and our holy Father Brassinjaw,"
 said the Abbess, "it is requisite this marriage, for a season, be kept a
 profound secret."
  </p><p> The Cripple was rather relieved than annoyed at hearing this; for,
 so completely by surprise had he been taken, that although he had a
 wife, he had no idea of where he was to take her, or how he was to provide for her. The only boon he craved, and that he did secretly of the
 Abbess, was for permission to divulge the truth to one friend-and that
 friend was Edward Osborne. This permission being granted, the assemblage dispersed.  Father Brassinjaw remained for some time in
 secret conference with the Abbess upon their future plans; and the
 Cripple, taking a kind adieu of his sweet young wife, strolled towards the
 Bridge.
  </p><p> The farther he receded from the nunnery, the more and more did the
 bright vision seem to vanish from his view, until at last, as he placed the
 key in the tower door, and heard the welcome of the old owl, he really
 began to imagine that he rather dreamt, or was the sport of fairies.  " If
 this be true, in very deed, old wife," he said, addressing the owl, " I
 must become another Harry, and divorce you, or cut off your head.
 Ha, ha ! ho, ho ! he, he !- curses on that laugh ! I have sworn to conquer it; and I will, or tear my tongue out."
We must now leave the Cripple in his sea of dreamy wonder. He








<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>                     .

knew not what to think--was he married ?  It is a thing that few men
ever doubt of, if once they try it; but his marriage had been so like a
tale of wild romance, that a doubt would still arise; and in his dreams
that night he dreamt it was a dream.</p>

</p><p>HEWET, notwithstanding the alternate quarrels King Henry was always
having, first with the King of France, then with the Emperor of Germany, then with the Pope, this day being their friend, the next their
bitterest enemy, arrived safely in Italy. He wandered from place to
place, inquiring wherever he had heard Sir Filbut Fussy had friend or
relation, about the parties he was seeking; but he could learn nothing
likely to throw a light upon the strange elopement. It is true, he heard
in Milan that Sir Filbut had written to announce his intended journey;
but he had not arrived, nor had any of his acquaintances lately heard
from or of him. As Queen Jane was now ill, and the King having determined that no coronation should take place, the ostensible purpose for
which the merchant had travelled so far, was useless, and Master
Hewet received orders to return with all dispatch to England. The
vessel arrived in the Channel, and landed him on the Sussex coast, for
it was Master Hewet's wish to pay a mercantile visit to a town that
lay hard by. Having accomplished the end he had in view, he started
on his homeward journey, riding post, and attended by a country
guide.
 </p><p> The guide proved a loquacious clown, whose tongue ran on much
faster than his horses.  "I make bold to guess your honour be from
foreign parts ?" observed the guide.
 </p><p> Hewet nodded a slight assent.
 </p><p> " Ah! they be strange places, I have heered. The Frenchmen, they
says, can live on nothin, and the Italians eats their wittles by the yard.
Why don't they live on beef and puddin as we do ? It's our beef and
puddin that makes us thrash 'em as we always does."
 </p><p> Master Hewet, finding he must listen to his guide, whether he
wished it or not, endeavoured, by a leading question or two, to elicit, if
possible, a little of the flying news of the day.
 </p><p> " News !" said the guide, " oh, holy ! there be plenty of news, only it's
all old; that is, it's the same thing over and over again. We know that
if we are told that Queen Anne's an angel to-day, we shall hear that
she's a devil to-morrow; and if the King's got a new wife this week,
he'll have a newerer one next.  I wish he'd take a fancy to my old
woman, for I'm plaguy tired on her!"
 </p><p> But," said Hewet, "is there nothing stirring in these parts ?"
 </p><p> "Stirrin !" replied the guide, "oh, holy ! there be plenty a stirrin
hereabouts. There have been two chaps down here stirrin up the old
nuns like new 'uns. One was called Master Spike, I thinks, and a sharp







                        <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>

chap he was; the other-but he was a precious bad 'un amongst the
nuns, I heered-was called Master Harry Horton."
</p><p>  "Horton ?" said Hewet.
 </p><p> "Oh, hoiy! Horton, that was the worst 'uns name; but they're gone
to Lunnun town, and a good riddance to bad rubbish, says I."
</p><p>  The road through which they journeyed being fully exposed to the
burning sun, became intolerably oppressive. The guide, perceiving that
the merchant could not bear the heat so well as he could, said, " If
you'd take a fool's advice, just jump down here, get over that stile, and
walk through the wood.  I'll take the horses round to the other side, two
miles off; you'll find it a lovely shady grove to stroll through, and you'll
come out as cool and fresh as a daisy.  I see that you are well armed,
not that there's much to be afeared on.  I hav'nt heered of a robbery
there for a good many days past, and I don't think any one has beer
killed there for these six months."
 </p><p> This off-hand manner of the country clown, in speaking of the danger
from robbers or murderers, should not be regarded by the reader as far-
fetched, or unlikely to be pretty near the usual way in which desperate
acts were then spoken of; for so brutalized had all classes become by
habit (we speak of their appreciation of the horrible), that to hear
of a murder having been committed, was to listen to something
scarcely worthy of a second thought; and as to robberies, we may
easily imagine to what extent they were carried, when we find it
on record, that during the reign of " Bluff King Hal," in the olden time
of " Merrie England"-heigho! no less than upwards of SEVENTY
TWO THOUSAND of " great thieves, of petty thieves, and rogues" were
hanged! King Henry reigned thirty-eight years, so that there were,
taking them at a round average, per year, one thousand nine hundred,
or rather more than five executions for every day during the whole
reign. If it were taken into account the executions (in many cases
murders) for alleged treason, or heresy, the numbers would become
more like seven for every twenty-four hours, during thirty-eight years.
 </p><p> When we reflect upon these things, strong doubts will obtrude on our
mind, whether, notwithstanding all our boasted civilization, it be possible
to discover in the annals of any Eastern, despotic, barbaric state, a more
appalling disregard of human life; for, let it be remembered, that those
executions did not form any part of martial retaliation in time of war,
or of massacres in a time of revolt, but were cold-blooded, judicial, premeditated acts.
 </p><p> Having made this slight digression, the reader will, we trust, not
feel surprised at the countryman appearing to think it very recommendatory of the locality, to assert that " he had not heard of a robbery
there for a good many days past; and not of a murder, no, not for at
least six months !"
 </p><p> Although this high praise regarding the safety of the road through the
wood, might not be quite satisfactory to some, yet the merchant felt so
oppressed and overcome by the heat, that he at once followed the guide's
advice; and receiving very minute directions with respect to the way he
was to go, and also a large whistle, that the guide declared could be
heard at least five miles off (this was in case he should be attacked)

  Master Hewet crossed the stile and entered the wood; for some way
  he could hear the guide singing a country ditty, in an accent as broad as
  his own shoulders: the rustic's ditty ran something after this fashion:-
   </p><p>            <quote rend="blockquote"><l> Tho' merry wag beards in the stately hall,
                  </l><l>Yet merry wag tails on the rustic green;
                </l><l>Tho' maids of the green wear nor coif, nor caul,
                  </l><l>And dames of the hall sport their silken sheen-
              </l><l>Pray which be the happier life of the two ?
              </l><l>Why, fool ! can't you tell I ?-then why should I you ?
                               </l><l>Fol de rol, de rol, lol de rol, fol de rol lol !</l></quote>
 </p><p>In most of our olden ditties we find this style of ending a verse-we
 mean with " Fol de rol, de rol,"-greatly in vogue; and as poets gene,
 rally kept their most pungent witticisms to the last, we have no doubt
 there is some hidden meaning in these concluding syllables, well worthy
 the attention of our most recondite and laborious antiquarians; would
 that we had time and talent to discover it! But hark ! the voice of
 the rustic has not yet died away-
 </p><p>        <quote rend="blockquote"><l>       'Tis useless to try, mon, to mark out the best,
                  </l><l>For God makes as happy, a dog as a cat.
                </l><l>'Tis like to him blessing-and him that is blest,
                  </l><l>The pleasure's the same-depend upon that.
              </l><l>So which be the happier life of the two ?
              </l><l>Why, fool! can't you tell I ?-then why should I you ?
                               </l><l>Fol de rol, de rol, lol de rol, fol de rol lol!</l></quote>
 </p><p> As their roads lay almost at right angles to each other, the distance between
  them at every step increasing, the sound of the countryman's voice in the
  same proportion diminished; it became fainter and fainter, and as Collins
  would have said, had he then lived, was " by distance made more sweet."
  The last sound had died away, and all was still as death. The merchant
  found the coolness of the shade refreshing in a powerful degree; not a
  leaf rustled in the air, not even a bird's sweet note was heard to change
  the monotony of the silence which reigned around. Now the trees closed
in so thickly over the narrow path, that night appeared suddenly to have
  usurped the hours of day-sometimes a spot, sometimes a streak of light,
  would steal through here and there, and then a wide green open space
  appear, but still no sound. The merchant had again entered the pathway, on the other side of one of those open spaces, and was mending
  his pace, for the stillness became oppressively monotonous.  He almost
  started at the sound of his own breathing, so loud did it seem to his ear,
  made doubly sensitive by straining to catch a sound that never came.
  He was just reflecting upon the truism, that how different are the same
  things under different circumstances-the jargon of the country clown he
  had just before thought almost unbearable, he would now have welcomed
  as sweetest music.    He   was half tempted    to  try the  effect of
  the loud whistle he carried in his hand, but feared that they who
  heard it might think it cowardice that had prompted him to use it.
  </p><p>  It now occurred to him, might not the guide be an accomplice of the
 very robbers he had mentioned as sometimes paying visits to these woods,
 and have given him that whistle, to call them to the spot to murder him ?
 The merchant, although no coward, had by degrees brought his mind
 into so nervous a state, that he had nearly sunk upon the earth, as a







                                           <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>

sound resembling a groan suddenly struck upon his ear; he paused,
and held his breath, until large drops of perspiration burst from his
forehead; he had almost convinced himself that it was but the effect of
imagination, when he heard the groan repeated, and now so audibly,
that no longer doubt remained. He drew his sword, and standing on
his guard, listened to discover the direction whence the sound proceeded.
Ere long a deep-drawn sigh too plainly pointed out the spot; it was one
he had just passed. He retraced his way for a few paces, which brought
him again to the edge of the light open space. A faint voice now endeavoured to call for help, and pushing aside some underwood, the
merchant discovered the body of a man; he drew it forth, and kneeling
down, raised up the dying man's head upon his arm, when, what was his
horror, to discover the features of the blighter of all his hopes. Sir
Filbut's eyes met his; he uttered a low shriek and fainted.
</p><p>  A thousand feelings hurried across the mind of Hewet; at one moment
he had raised his sword to take the little life that yet remained. Should
he leave him there to rot like a dog, as ajust punishment for the wrongs
he had inflicted? He knew not what to do; revenge, hate, pity, all
contended at once within the merchant's breast; as he still gazed upon
him, lost in doubt, the eyes of the wounded man again opened, and he
strove to speak. So weak was he from loss of blood, that his lips moved
several times without uttering a sound; at last he said, as a smile passed
over his features, " She-she-is innocent !" and then sank back again
exhausted.
 </p><p> The merchant for a moment felt his heart rise into his very throat-
he seemed choking.  " Oh, Heaven !" at last he exclaimed, " make but
that appear, and I will willingly lay down my life where now you lie;
speak-speak-for mercy sake speak those words once more."
 </p><p> Sir Filbut did not move, and Hewet believed that all was ended; yet,
one effort might be made; he placed the whistle to his lips, the shrill
sound of which had scarcely died away, when it was answered by another,
and in a few minutes Hewet saw his country guide hurrying towards
him, attended by three or four other country clowns.
 </p><p> They did not appear at all astonished at what they saw, their only
surprise was, that their quarter-staves were not required to protect the
merchant. A few branches were soon laid across each other, and a
quantity of grass placed upon them, and then the wounded knight; in
this manner he was soon borne out of the wood.
</p><p>  The merchant's anxiety was now so great, fearing that he would die
ere he had made that clear, which was at present hid in the deepest
mystery, that he tempted the men, by promises of high reward,
to continue their road as quickly as possible towards London, where
proper assistance could be obtained.
 </p><p> Edward Osborne had been apprised, that on that day he might probably see his good master return home, so he made up his mind that
the merchant's coming would be the fulfilment of the witch's prophecy;
but in this he was mistaken, for a very different visitor called upon him
at the house upon the Bridge.
 </p><p> Flora and the Bridge-shooter being both at the front window, and seeing
a splendid retinue approaching, put their heads still further forward, but
         16








<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>                   .

the Bridge-shooter popped his own in, and drew Flora from the window
too, for he recognised in the leader of the party, the handsome youth
who had noticed Flora, and kissed his hand to her; they were watching
at a distance from the window until the party should have passed, when
what was the poor Bridge-shooter's consternation, to see the handsome
youth draw up at the door, alight, and then enter his master's house.
 </p><p> The man in the shop, believing Edward Osborne to be in the first floor,
shewed the stranger into the very room in which Flora and William
were; to attempt escape was useless, so the Bridge-shooter stood looking
vastly silly, and poor Flora blushed enormously.
 </p><p> "What !" said the youth, "is it indeed you, my pretty maid? Why,
I have been dreaming about you all night; but it was not to seek you
I am now here, but one Edward Osborne."
 </p><p> At this moment Edward entered: " That is Master Edward," said
Flora, again blushing, and with William was about to retire.
  </p><p>" Nay, stay !" said the youth; " the more who hear what I now say
to Edward Osborne, the more shall I be pleased."  He then went towards Edward and frankly taking him by the hand, said, " Sir, I owe
you a debt," Edward stared with surprise, " a debt that at this moment
I am unable to pay, but one I wish to acknowledge: Edward Osborne,
I owe you my life! Do you not remember saving a youth, who was
drowning up by Chelsea ?-I am he. Do not think me ungrateful that
I have not been to thank you before, but I knew not until yesterday
the name of my preserver. Those who were with me, when they saw
that I was safe, sought you, but in vain; you were gone, no one knew
whither. After all other enquiries had failed, as a mere jest, we visited
a certain cunning woman at Houndsditch, and would you, or any one believe it, by her magic art, she instantly told me your name, and where you
could be found." To the three whom he addressed, this did not seem very
wonderful; but he continued, "Henceforth I shall never doubt witch
craft again. I come, not only in my own name, but in that of my
father also, to tell you, that throughout your life, if either of us ever can
be of service to you, command, and you shall not find us wanting. I
am called George Talbot-my father is the Earl of Shrewsbury."
  </p><p> Edward Osborne said a hundred pretty things fitted to the occasion,
and, as usual, whenever swimming was mentioned, he always gave the
whole credit of his own accomplishment to his humble friend, the worthy
Bridge-shooter. Upon this, William had a real Earl's son shake him
by the hand, who repeated to him the same promise he had made to
Osborne. He placed a very valuable ring upon the finger of Edward, as
he once more took him by the hand at parting; then turning to the Bridge-
shooter, he said, smiling, and glancing towards Flora, "The frown
you gave me when last we met, told me pretty plainly in what quarter
your heart lies; so, remember, when you two marry, I will give away
the bride. Farewell, and believe me, the promises a Talbot makes he
keeps !"
 </p><p>  Osborne attended the youth to the door, and after another smile and
another shake of the hand, George Talbot, with his gay companions,
   passed across the Bridge.
     </p><p>                    "Now is not this like all mother's witchcraft?" said William; "you








                        <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>

      but to wait for four-and-twenty hours,and you find it's all moonshine.
Why couldn't she have told us yesterday who was coming, and what he
wanted, instead of making such a mystery about it?   But then it
wouldn't have appeared like magic.  The spell is working, the spell
is working," he said, imitating the manner and tone of the old woman.
"Well, if it makes her happy, and doesn't do her any harm, perhaps,
it's as well to let her have her way, poor old soul."
"The Earl of Shrewsbury," said Osborne, musing; "he is high in
the favour of the King, a great soldier, and of a most noble line. You
see, William, what fine friends your instructions have brought me.
But, hoping I may never stand in need of his favours, I am still glad to
find that the great have memories for little services received. I have
ever been taught the contrary."
</p><p>"And what a handsome young man he is," said Flora; "and what
a sweet smile he has; and -"
 </p><p> And he said he'd give you away; that's more than I'd do," said
the Bridge-shooter,  only let us once be married."
 </p><p> "Married, pooh !" said pretty Flora, tossing up her head; "you
don't think I'd marry a boy that's still learning his letters."
</p><p>" Never mind my letters," replied William; "I knows-I mean
know-yes, I know the verb to love better than you do, with all your
larning."
 </p><p> " Learning !" said Flora, with great gravity. "Correct speaking
  always proves gentility of connections."
</p><p>  'Are all things in readiness for our good master, if he return to-night ?"
  inquired Edward.
</p><p>    " Oh, yes, Master Edward," replied Flora.  "Heigho, heigho! would
 that we had more comfort to give him when he comes; but his house is
 desolate. Hark ! what murmuring sound is that ?"
 </p><p>   Flora and the  Bridge-shooter ran to the window, and looking
 towards the entrance of the Bridge, they perceived a crowd approaching.
 As it came nearer, they were surprised to see in the midst of it the good
 merchant, Master Hewet. They all instantly hurried down to the front
 door, and surprised indeed they were, when the countrymen who carried
 the wounded knight, now hidden from the gaze of the crowd by a large
 cloak, brought their burden into the merchant's shop. The crowd, who
 had gathered a few particulars from the country-guide, were aware that
 the litt r bore a wounded man, but whom they knew not."
</p><p> "I wonder not at your surprise," said Hewet to those in his house,
  at seeing me arrive thus accompanied; but your astonishment will
 be increased a hundred fold when you look upon the features of him
 who lies there, as I fear, dying. Wait not to ask questions, but prepare a
 couch whereon he may lie at ease."
 </p><p>   " This way," said Osborne, opening the door of the room behind
  the shop, which, during the merchant's absence, he had made his sleeping-room, that he might the better guard his master's property. When
the dying man was lifted upon the couch, and the clock removed, Osborne's astonishment was indeed extreme.  The physician whom the
  merchant had summoned to attend, as they came along, now examined
  the wounds; they were five in number, and as he regarded them, he







<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>                   .

shook his head in a manner that augured but little hope. Having dressed
the wounds, and administered a restorative, the physician retired, promising to come again, but at the same time whispering to the merchant
that "he believed it would be merely to look upon a corse."
 </p><p> The merchant, as they sat watching the dying man, in a low voice
acquainted Osborne with the manner in which he had discovered the
knight, and the blessed words, the only ones he had yet uttered, which
told of Alyce's innocence. This made Flora weep tears of joy, for she
loved her mistress dearly.
</p><p>  Sir Filbut moved uneasily upon his couch; they ran to him, when
looking around him, he said, "Am I indeed beneath this roof?  It is
but justice-justice-that I should die here. I have but a brief space
left to render all the reparation now within my power: pray Heaven
may grant me sufficient strength to say all I would have you know. But
first, bear witness that here I swear, before Heaven and man, that Alyce
is as an angel innocent. My vanity, and the plottings of a fiend, have
wrought this misery. You remember the day that Alyce left this roof?
I waited her coming with all the mad vanity of a fool; she came, but
instead of her eyes beaming with love, as I had hoped, and indeed expected, they were red with weeping. A look of shame and indignation
overspread her features as she said, ' I have taken a bold step, but one
my heart tells me my injured pride will justify. Tell me, tell me,' she
exclaimed, bursting into tears, ' what have I ever done to call from you
this deadliest insult an honest wife can e'er receive-the words of love
from any but her husband?' 'Alyce,' I said, astounded at what I
heard, 'you cannot, Alyce, pretend to be ignorant, after the letters you
have received.' ' Letters,' she replied, 'I have received no letters but
the one I found in my room last night, and that I tore and burnt, after
drowning it in tears of shame."
 </p><p> Here the merchant and Flora looked at each other, for they remembered the fragments of the letter they had found, and which had seemed
so thoroughly to have proved her guilt.
 </p><p> "No letters!' I exclaimed, 'why, Flora has given you at least
twenty."
 </p><p> "Oh, heavens!" exclaimed Flora.
</p><p>  " Do not interrupt me," said the knight. "I know now that you
were faultless. I then explained to her how Horton, your apprentice,
working upon my vanity, had first told me that she had confessed to
Flora her love for me. I paid him heavily to buy up Flora's silence, and
to tempt her to give my letters secretly to her mistress.  He pretended
to bring back messages of kindness and affection. All circumstances
combined to lead me on in my madness. One night, during your absence, while singing beneath her window, I saw a female form watching
at the casement-the window gently opened--"
</p><p>  " Oh, dear ! oh, dear !" exclaimed Flora; "some of the mischief, then,
I did really cause. It was I who opened the casement, to listen to a
serenade offered, as I thought, by her intended to Alice Vaughan, opposite."
 </p><p> " I thought it was your mistress.  Horton had told me she would
expect me on that night. Oh! how I blush, not only for my villany,







                                           <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>

 but for my weakness, in thus being made the dupe of such a wretch!
 But what had most confirmed me, was Alyce's reception of the costly
 diamond I sent her by him."
  </p><p> "He told us," interrupted the merchant, "he had found it, and
 prayed of my wife to wear it for that one day, and that no doubt the
 next he should discover the right owner. The next day he said he had
 done so, and received it back again, and we never saw it more."
 </p><p>  " So Alyce told me," said the knight; "it was his scheme, the offer
 I made to teach her riding; he told me it was her own idea. The
 thing that surprised me most was, that believing as I did that I possessed
 the affection of Alyce, yet, whenever we were alone, no look, no word,
 ever escaped her that you might not have witnessed. He told me that
 was her whim; she would not allow a word of love but in my letters,
 and that I must put up with her fancies until we were safe abroad.
 Finding that I had indeed been duped, I fell upon my knees before
 Alyce, and sought her forgiveness. I told her that a vessel lay in the
 river, in which I had believed she was to fly with me to Italy; that on
 board that vessel Horton had conveyed all my wealth, and that I would
 hasten thither, and from that hour she should never more be insulted by
 my presence. I left her, my heart bursting with feelings of remorse for
 my conduct towards that angel and yourself, with vengeance against
 the villain Horton, and shame for my own weak folly. I was on my
 way to seek out Horton, and bring him to a dread account before I fled
 this land for ever. I had not gone far, when I was suddenly seized and
 dragged to a boat. I was conveyed on board the very vessel I had paid
 so much to purchase. I was kept close prisoner in the hold. The man
 who appeared to have command was a giant in form, with eyes unnaturally protruding. He returned to the shore, after giving orders to sail to
 the Continent, and when the cargo was delivered, to return to a certain
 part of the Sussex coast, and there await his coming. After we were well
 at sea, I was removed to a better prison. By what I could gather
 from words that reached me through the partition of my cabin, I
 learnt that the crew were smugglers, and that they believed my fate
 was to be a watery grave. At last we returned in sight of the Sussex
 coast. One dark night, despair giving me strength, I managed to force so
 much away from the sides of the little window of my prison, that at last
 I succeeded in making my way thence into the flood beneath. I swam to
 shore. The next day, I was on my way to denounce Horton, when, near
 the spot in which you found me, I saw two men in the distance, who
 perceiving me, muffled their faces in their cloaks, and receded again into
 the wood. I had only just entered the covered path, when I was suddenly stabbed. I saw not those who inflicted the wounds. I had fallen
 on my face-had fainted !"
 </p><p> Here Sir Filbut appeared completely exhausted, but after a violent
 effort, he said, " Ere I sink in death, let me be blessed by hearing from
 the lips of Alyce, that I die forgiven."
 </p><p>  They now explained, that since the day he had seen her last, she had
never again returned. This he seemed scarcely to comprehend, for his
mind began to wander; they endeavoured to discover what he knew
concerning the abduction of the child, but this was hopeless; he sank







<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>                      .

  upon the pillow, and as in a dream he murmured, " and let-thine eyes
  --change-night to-day," he then drew one long deep breath, and he
  was dead.
   </p><p> "Bring yonder screen,' said the merchant, " and place it before the
 couch."
   </p><p> Flora and the Bridge-shooter in doing this, revealed to the eyes of
 Hewet, the portrait of his beloved Alyce, which Osborne had hid there,
 instead of destroying it. The moment the merchant saw that sweet
 face, he rushed towards it and kissed it madly. But now, instead of the
 revelation made by the murdered knight, clearing up the mystery concerning Alyce and the child, that mystery seemed to become more and
 more profound. In proportion as the heart of the merchant had been
 relieved by what he had just heard, the heavier grew the pain of his
 bereavement. She was innocent, but she was gone. What might not be
 her fate-her sufferings ? and his child too !--  They were lost in a sea of
 conjectures, when suddenly a messenger came hurrying in, from the mother
 of the Bridge-shooter to Edward Osborne, praying of him for his life to
 hasten to the Convent of the Minories-to take with him her son, or any
 trusty friend; but on his life not to neglect her bidding, for there was
 one who would require all his assistance.
 </p><p>  The old woman had kept to herself, that it was the Cripple who stood
 in need of aid; so her son, thinking there might be something of real
 moment' hidden beneath her words, prayed of the merchant to accompany them-" For," as he said, " who knows, but mother at last may
 turn out a witch in reality; that cross, and the blind girl meant something, you may depend."
 </p><p>  Hewet had other reasons for wishing to go to the Convent; his was a
 wish to make an offering of thanksgiving, in the shape of a rich present
 at the altar.
 </p><p>  Flora, who wouldn't, no, not for a wedding-ring even, remain at home
in the house of death now it had become night, seized hold of the Bridge-
shooter's arm, and insisted upon going too.
 </p><p>  Before they arrived there, a strange scene had been enacted. Horton,
armed, as he thought, with full authority, had had the hardihood again
to face the insulted Abbess; but here he found a head older, and more
subtle than his own; she well knew the game that he would play, and
therefore laid her plans to thwart him, and this she did in a way that
at once should crush his pride, and satisfy her feelings of revenge. Had
he conjured from the depths of the darkest regions an enemy, he could
not have found one more to be feared than the Abbess of St. Clair. She
knew that she could not shut her doors against the King's Commissioners,
so she had shut the doors against his hopes.
 </p><p>  Horton had come to take away the blind girl, Eoline :--" You take
her hence, you !" said the Abbess; " and pray who may you be, possessing such mighty power ? A slave of the court, an oppressor of the
weak, I know you to be; but strong as you think yourself, that poor
blind child shall laugh your threats to scorn."
 </p><p> " You ask me who I am--you know it well !" said Horton. "You
ask me my power over Eoline-you know that too!     Who else has
power, if I have it not ?"








                                            <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>

  </p><p> " He's here !" replied the Abbess, as the Cripple entered.
  </p><p> " He !" said Horton with a sneer, "why, 'tis the Cripple of the
 Bridge-what power has he ?"
  </p><p> " The strongest of all I" replied the Abbess, " the power of a husband!
 Ha, ha ! you are foiled; Eoline is now the Cripple's wife. Take her,
 Cripple, take her and all she does, or may possess. You may frown
 and look big," she said, addressing Horton, " but what I do, I do
 strongly. You may as well endeavour to part the world in two, as
 part that man from his lawful wife."
 </p><p>  How long this scene would have lasted, we know not, but it was
suddenly put a stop to, by the nuns running in, shrieking in wild
alarm: the Convent was on fire. All was now confusion and dismay,
the bell was rung, the people from the farm came quickly to their aid;
the night being dark, the flames told those far off the destruction that
was going on. Horton, laughing at their distress, left them to their
fates.
 </p><p>  He had scarcely gone, when the merchant and those of his household
arrived. Here were some carrying the rich furniture of the chapel, and
placing it upon the grass; the nuns surrounded it, and falling upon their
knees, sung a prayer to Heaven to befriend them: the scene was strange,
but picturesque and awful, for the flames kept rapidly gaining strength.
All the nuns, and indeed every inmate of the place was mustered, and
their names called over, to see that none were left in the burning pile;
they now remembered the two poor old bed-ridden sisters of St. Clair,
who had hitherto been forgotten; they inhabited the upper story of the
Convent, to which the flames were fast approaching. Who dared attempt
to save them ? All stood aloof. No! the Cripple and the Bridge-shooter
both rushed into the burning pile; it was a dreadful moment of suspense;
the fire roared more fiercely; the timbers cracking, sent up showers or
sparks high into the air.
 </p><p> Distant bells were now heard ringing at the various religious houses
round about, and soon troops of monks and villagers came thronging in.
Eoline, who was clinging to the merchant Hewet, suddenlyuttereda shriek,
and said to him in accents made scarcely audible by horror-" There is
one they have forgotten yet, the mad girl in the vaults beneath; in
Heaven's name attempt to save her! The way is intricate and dark, but
I can lead you there, for darkness has no power over the blind; come,
for the love of Heaven, come !" She hurried along, holding the hand of
the merchant, whose humanity would have prompted him to the bold
attempt alone, and save her from the hazard of death, but he knew not
how to find the spot without her help. As they entered the vaults,
they heard loud shouts that the poor old nuns were rescued.
 </p><p> The Cripple now ran about frantic, for Eoline was nowhere to be
found. So great had been the consternation and confusion, that both she
and the merchant had not been perceived taking the way they had. The
Cripple was obliged to be secured by force, or he had again rushed into
the flames-he fancied he heard the voice of Eoline calling upon him for
help.
 </p><p> While this scene was going on before the burning Convent, the merchant and the blind girl were threading their way through long passages














<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>                   .

beneath, in which the air now became intolerably oppressive, from the
increasing heat. The merchant could not help feeling a thrill of horror
at their situation; if he let go the poor girl's hand, or she were to faint, all
hope must vanish; the place was dark as the grave, and they had wound
first one way then another, so that to retrace his steps unguided were
impossible.
 </p><p> " We are near the spot now," she said, as they reached a door, which,
to her horror, she found was locked. " Oh, all is lost !" she said; "the
door of this passage is fastened; unless you have strength to break it
down, the poor mad creature must be burnt alive."
 </p><p> The merchant exerted again and again all his strength, but in vain;
a last effort more violent from despair, and the shattered door flew in a
hundred pieces before them. Eoline once more took his hand, and on
they went anew. " 'Tis here!" she said, unbolting a door; " her's is a
silent madness; she never speaks; feel for her where she lies; take
her in your arms, she will not resist."
 </p><p> The merchant entered the cell, and feeling his way round by the walls,
had nearly made the circuit of the place, when his foot was stayed by
something lying on the ground; he stooped, and found it was a human
being.
 </p><p> " Quick, quick, bring her forth !" said Eoline; "take her in your arms,
and I will, byyour cloak, lead you hence: we must be quick ! on, on !"
 </p><p> Hope reanimated them, and they hurried forward, for the merchant
now had confidence in the power of his guide. He had nearly dropped
his precious load, and fallen headlong down, for he stumbled over the
fragments of the shattered door. As they approached the longed-for
egress from this dismal place, the noise and confusion without became
more distinct; at last they saw the opening at the end of the passage:
one moment more and they were safe.
  </p><p>The Cripple who thought at that time of no one but his Eoline,
flew to her, and danced about as though he had been mad.
 </p><p> The merchant had gone forward to deposit his charge in safety, further
from the burning Convent. Presently all turned to where he stood, for
with a frantic cry he called to all around. " Oh, Heavens !" he exclaimed, " see, here! see, here ! it is an angel that I am pressing to my
heart. It is my Alyce-it is my wife !"</p>

</p><p>IT was no time for explanation ; nor, indeed, did the merchant for an instant
think of aught but of his own happiness in once more pressing his dearAlyce
to his heart.  How she came to be in such a strange place as the cell of
the Convent, or why she had been only known as the mad girl, at
that time never crossed his mind; he only saw, he only felt, that his
beloved wife was again restored to his heart, and that was all-in-all to
him. As crowds of apprentices, and others, had arrived from the city,
an attempt to extinguish the flames was commenced, very different to
that which the drones in monkish hoods had as yet pursued, for all they
had done was to walk in procession round the burning edifice, chanting
prayers, but never once appearing to think that manual exertion was
quite as likely to prove efficacious, as their mumbling of Latin verses,
of which many of them were far too ignorant even to comprehend the
meaning.  Buckets and tubs, handed from one to the other by a whole
line of apprentices, reaching from the Convent to a neighbouring pond,
soon served to bring sufficient water to combat, and at last to overcome
the raging flames.
 </p><p> How differently were the minds of those present now at work. Here
might be seen a poor bigotted nun on her knees, offering up thanks for
the miraculous manner in which she had been permitted, at the hazard
of her life, to rescue from destruction about two inches of the decayed
back-bone of a saint somebody, who had been principally revered because
he had lived for forty years without the comfort of a single ablution;
there was the master of the farm, calculating in his own mind the increase
of trouble and expense in providing lodgings and board for the nuns at the
farm; the apprentices' minds were full of the fun of throwing as much
water over one another as they did over the flames. The Cripple
thought only of his Eoline. Flora's mind was divided between joy and
wonder at the restoration of her mistress, and anxiety for the safety of the
Bridge-shooter, who was foremost at every point of danger in his endeavours to extinguish the fire of the Convent.  The merchant had but one
hope, that of conveying his Alyce in safety to his home. When the
Convent began to assume the appearance of a blackened ruined mass,
and fears of further danger seemed to have vanished, all present began
to reflect more coolly upon what was next to be done, in the way of
providing accommodation for the houseless nuns, and their own arrangements for the night.  The Abbess and her flock made the best shift they
could at the farm, the labourers of which continued for the rest of the
night to watch the ruins, and wherever a thicker smoke arose, as if from
a hidden fire beneath, to throw water upon the smouldering embers. It
was settled that the Cripple should conduct his beautiful blind wife








<pb id="p.130" n="130"/>                  .

to the cottage of the Bridge-shooter's mother, where she should for the
present take up her regular abode.
 </p><p> A litter, borne by two horses, was soon provided, in which Alyce was
placed, and with Osborne on one side, and the merchant on the other,
Hewet holding his wife's hand in his own, they took their way towards
the Bridge.  Flora and the Bridge-shooter had hurried on before to make
all ready for the reception of the merchant's wife. As the litter was
passing through the dark postern gate of the city, the horses had nearly
ridden over a man who came on hurrying from the opposite direction;
he appeared hastening towards the Convent. So completely had his
fright, caused by the horses, thrown him off his guard, that he uttered a
dreadful oath, in a violent tone of voice, at the sound of which the whole
party recognised him as being the saintly Father Brassinjaw.  At the
same time a slight shriek came from the litter, and Alyce murmured,
" Oh, save me! save me !"  Hewet thought no more of the priest, who
had hurried by, but pressed his wife's hand fervently to his lips, as if to
tell her, by that kiss, how safe she was with those about her. These
words were the first Alyce had yet uttered, and immediately they had
died upon her lips, she appeared to sink again into her former hopeless
state of imbecility. When they arrived at the merchant's house, a little
incident occurred, which caused the blood in Hewet's heart to swell it
almost to bursting; this was, as he was entering the room, bearing his
wife in his arms, his eye fell upon her picture, which Flora and the
Bridge-shooter had restored to its former position. A thousand feelings
rushed upon his mind at once; the order he had given for its destruction
-the unhallowed thoughts with which he had hastened to far-off lands
-and then came the bitterest reflection of all, that now, although his wife
was restored to him pure and innocent, where was his child ? Alas !
not there to welcome the return of its poor, afflicted, adoring mother. So
completely had all memory vanished from the mind of Alyce, that when
they seated her in her own accustomed spot, she looked around so vacantly, that it was evident all her eyes beheld brought back no recollections of the past. She regarded her husband with the same indifference
as she looked upon Edward or on Flora. There was a slight smile for
a single moment passed over her pale, but lovely features, when Juno,
her favourite dog, came bounding in, and flying upon her lap, licked her
hands in kindness, then barking loudly, as though to wake her from her
trance, flew wildly here and there, then rolled himself upon his back, and
gazed up in her face, as praying to be noticed.  Shortly afterwards Alyce
was conveyed to her sleeping apartment, and scarcely had her head sunk
upon the pillow, ere she was lost in a profound slumber. The merchant,
who had been seated watching by the side of her couch, now offered up to
Heaven a sincere thanksgiving for the restoration of his beloved wife, and a
prayer, equally fervent, that his child might soon he discovered, and once
more bless his arms.  Having fulfilled these duties, he joined the other
inmates of his dwelling, who were busily conversing upon the strangeness
of all the incidents of that day.  But how to account for the merchant's
wife being found in such a place as a cell in the Convent of the Minories, and in such a pitiable condition as that in which she had been discovered, passed all their ingenuity to imagine.  "No doubt," said








                                           <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>

the merchant, " all will be explained by the superior of the Convent,
and, indeed, it must and shall be. Strange things are being brought to
light concerning the evil practices of nearly every religious house in the
land; and if there be aught here of villany that has been employed
against my Alyce, my life and wealth shall both be sacrificed but I will
bring the guilty to severest punishment. But it were useless now to
conjecture; in the morning I will to the nunnery, when all shall be
made clear."  The rest, thinking with the merchant, that for the moment
it would be of no avail to endeavour further to solve the mystery, they
had all risen for the purpose of retiring to rest, when they were startled
by hearing a violent cry of horror-so suddenly, so unexpectedly, the
frightful shriek struck upon the ear, that for a moment they stood as
if spell-bound. They all turned towards the room in which Alyce lay;
but the sound had not proceeded from that direction.
 </p><p> Before we enter upon the cause of their alarm, we must follow the
footsteps of the saintly Father Brassinjaw, who, the reader will recollect,
passed the merchant and his party as they were entering the city by the
postern gate. He was then hurrying from the Cardinal's Hat, upon the
Bridge, where he had but just ensconced himself comfortably behind a
flagon of Romney sack, and was listening to a delightful dispute between
the three loving friends,Catchemayde, Checklocke, and Silkworm, concerning which of the three was of most importance, the bowyer, the shaft-head
maker, or the stringer ?  Why, the bowyer, of course," said Catchemayde, standing up as usual for his own craft; "a bow, mark me, is
like a human body, and, if so, I pray thee what would he the use of the
head or the sinews, if one lacketh the back-bone ?"  Catchemayde here
looked wondrous wise, as if he had accomplished a figure of speech of
uncommon beauty, and had started a proposition of unanswerable logic.
For ourselves, we see neither the logic nor the beauty; but those whom
he addressed, seemed to think the allegory well deserving to be answered
in a similar strain of figurative reasoning, for Silkworm replied-
  </p><p>"But thy back-bone, as thou callest the bow-staff, would avail thee
nought, but for the strings, or sinews, as I call them, to bend it to thy
will."
 </p><p> " Nor either do much service," said Checklocke, " but for the sharp
head to direct the aim; and my heads are sharp enough to strike conviction into the thickest skull in Christendom.  I'll warrant them to
penetrate an inch board at eight hundred feet."
</p><p>  If shot from one of my bows," replied Catchemayde.
</p><p>  "And that bow strung by me," retorted Silkworm.
 </p><p> "And the arrow-shaft boiled, pared, and feathered by your humble
servant," said a sharp-nosed little man, an arrow-maker.  "It's my
opinion, neighbours," he continued, " that more depends upon the
straightness of the arrow-shaft and the goose's feathers, than all your
handy-works together.  An arrow of an ounce weight, well mounted
with two equal feathers, plucked from the white wing of a gander of
two years old, and one from a goose that's brown or gray, to mark the
proper placing of the arrow, will-will-will-- "
 </p><p> "Wilt thou   hold thy peace ?" interrupted  Father Brassinjaw.
" Cease this senseless jargon of thy trades, shake hands in amity, for if







<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>                   .

but one of ye lend not the others aid, believe me, we shall see no more
victories like Cressy, Agincourt, or Poictiers-you four must never
quarrel, or woe to the land we live in. All England's greatness owe we
to the bow and arrow; and to whom, I pray ye, do we owe the arrow
or the bow ?  Why, to you four combined, do we not ?  So come, shake
hands, and I'll join ye in the drinking of another bowl."
 </p><p>  This well-timed flattery produced an instantaneous effect, and a
thumping bowl was about to be ordered, when mine host entering, announced that the sky had become suddenly illumined by a raging conflagration somewhere by the Minories.
  </p><p> "The Minories!" exclaimed Father Brassinjaw, rising; but waiting
not the answer, he hurried away himself to learn the truth.  Most or
the other visitors of the Cardinal's Hat followed his example; the rest
ascended to the roof of the house, whence a distant view of the destruction going on could be observed. Father Brassinjaw had not proceeded
far before his worst fears were confirmed; so, pushing on more rapidly,
he soon reached the postern gate, where, as we have before stated, he
had nearly been trampled under the feet of the horses that were carrying
the litter in which lay Alyce Hewet. So anxious was he to reach the
Convent, that he did not perceive whom he had then passed, but uttering
the oath before-mentioned, and accelerating his speed almost into a run,
he continued his road to the nunnery. When arrived there, and with a
glance seeing the vast destruction that had so quickly been consummated,
he made no stay to ask particulars, but learning that the Abbess was
in safety at the farm, he was soon there too, and in the presence of the
superior of the nuns of St. Clair. " Sad work, this, holy sister," he
said, puffing and blowing, and in a tone made almost inaudible from
want of breath; "but deeply as I was buried in my devotions on the
Bridge, I lost not a moment in flying--I speak metaphorically, for, woe's
me! I'm   but an indifferent figure for such aerial exercises-yes, in
flying to your assistance, and now with my prayers--"
 </p><p> " Prayers !" ejaculated the Abbess, with an expression of utter contempt, and with a look as black as night.  "Prayers--thy prayers, indeed !"
 </p><p> " Oh, ay-yes, yes"-replied the saintly father; " I see, I see we are
alone; I had forgotten that ; so we may both throw off our masks.
But in the name of all the saints that ever, and never, were, why that
frown?   Sister, thy face looks as black as the burnt beams of yonder
Convent ?"
 </p><p> " Have I not ample cause to look black," replied the Abbess, " and
blackest of all at thee ? Is not the very roof of my house now smouldering in the ruins of the lowest vaults ? but that is a trifle, which a slight
manoeuvring that we well understand, would raise again higher and firmer
than ever: but you have brought upon us a trouble that may not only
remove the roof from over our heads, but the very foundations from
beneath our feet."
</p><p>  " What means my gentle Savage ?" inquired Brassinjaw.
 </p><p> The Father did not place his words thus as a jest, or insult-the
Abbess's name was really Savage. Elizabeth Savage was the last superior of the nuns of St. Clair, at the Convent of the Minoresses-hence our








.                         <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>

Minories. And it was this same Elizabeth Savage, who at the general
  suppression of the monasteries in <date value="1539">1539</date>, surrendered the house of the
  "Poor Clares," as they were called, into the hands of Henry the Eighth,
  who was to allow her a small pension, which, we believe, like most
  others of the sort, was never paid.
 </p><p>    "Not only Savage am I by name," she replied, "but savage thou
   shalt find me in my nature.  And this is what I mean-you have deceived me-the mad girl in the cell- "
  </p><p>   "Good heavens!" exclaimed Brassinjaw, "I had forgotten her; the
   saints forbid that she be buried in the ruins! Speak quickly, is she
   safe ?"
 </p><p>    " Safer than we are," replied the Abbess; "and all through your deceiving me. Your hypocrisy is so consummate, and, from habit, so
  essential to your very breathing, that methinks you'd die outright, were
  it but for one moment taken from you. Why not have told me who
  and what she was?"
 </p><p>    "And how know you now her name, or state?" said Brassinjaw,
   somewhat alarmed.
  </p><p>   "I know them both from one that cannot be deceived-her husband."
  </p><p>   "Hewet !" exclaimed the saintly Father.
  </p><p>   "He has been here," and found his wife confined as a lunatic in our
   cells beneath the Convent. You must account for this; I cannot, nor
   will I jeopardise myself or my nuns in screening you. The King lacks
   not the will, but a pretext for ruining us all-you have placed one in his
   hands. The merchant, they tell me, too, is now in favour with the
   Queen, because he seeks out costly baubles to feed her vanity. She is
   no favourer of our creed, and will, to serve her handsome merchant,
   work on the King to our undoing. You have raised up a pretty enemy,
   in truth."
  </p><p>   "Then you must raise a prettier friend to answer it," replied Brass-
  injaw; "I mean, young Horton."
  </p><p>   "Horton !" exclaimed the Abbess.  "Your blind folly makes me
 laugh with scorn. Do you so soon forget the hand we both have had in
 the marriage of Eoline with the Cripple of the Bridge ?  A likely friend,
 forsooth, we may look for in Harry Horton, the minion of our deadliest
 foe, the accursed Cromwell."
</p><p> "Sister," said Brassinjaw, " it is useless to lose our time in reviling
each other. You have a strong brain, stronger than mine, I know.  I
therefore at once throw myself humbly on thy mercy.  If you assist
him not, by your superior wisdom, poor Father Brassinjaw is lost for
ever."
 </p><p>    The hypocrite knew, that let a woman be a saint or sinner, a leader
 in the vanities of the outward world, or humble servant of some secluded
   shrine, the way for man to conquer, is by absolute submission.  The
   moment the Abbess found she had no obstacle to combat, her mind took
 a totally new turn.  "If you would have me advise you," she said, " in
 this woful strait you have brought upon yourself, speak for once openly
 and with truth.  I know the difficult task I am imposing upon you;
   but those who are learned in the healing art, cannot administer remedies








<pb id="p.134" n="134"/>                   .

with success, unless they first be made aware of the full extent and
causes of the disease they are called to conquer.  Firstly, answer me,
what made you bring the woman here ?"
  </p><p> "The hope of gain," he replied, unhesitatingly.
  </p><p> "Your answer carries truth with it in every word," said the Abbess;
 "but how did you seek to accomplish the end in view ?  Tell me all
 and every thing. I cannot give you absolution, nor even promise hope,
 unless your confession be full and ample."
</p><p>   " It shall be," said Father Brassinjaw, who felt that it would be a
difficult task to rescue himself from the dilemma into which chance circumstances had thrown him, unless aided by the good service of the
Abbess of St. Clair. From   what he now disclosed, it appeared he
had received from Sir Filbut Fussy several large sums of money for the
revelation of confessions which Alyce, as the reader may guess, had
never made. These, he said, he took care to shape in such a manner,
that Sir Filbut's vanity and hopes were fed at every word. Brassinjaw
finding that the more flattering to his dupe he made these mock confessions, the greater was his own reward, fiamed them so extravagantly,
that Sir Filbut, believing his power over Alyce had now become absolute, determined at once to fly with her. He wrote the letter, which
was afterwards found by Flora, torn and burnt; and Horton being absent with the merchant at Hampton Court, he insisted upon Brassinjaw
delivering it to the lovely Alyce.  This he undertook to do, without ever
intending to fulfil his promise. His plan was to destroy the letter, and
then trump up any tale he found most applicable to the circumstances, to
account for Alyce's non-compliance with its ardent prayer. Fate, however, was at work to bring all these vile schemes to a climax and an end;
for it so happened, that Sir Filbut insisted upon accompanying the saintly
Father almost to the door of the merchant's dwelling, as he hied him on
his promised mission; and then, with impatient anxiety, awaited the return of Brassinjaw with the hoped for reply. This was hurrying matters to a conclusion with a precipitation little expected by the priest;
but finding all remonstrance unavailing, he repaired to the dwelling of
the unconscious victim on the Bridge, where, making some frivolous
excuse for his untimely visit, not that any was required by Alyce, who,
in her religious views, was a bigot in the fullest sense of the word, and
regarded all her confessor advanced as sentences of holy inspiration, he
left her, and returning to the expectant Sir Filbut, delivered a most impassioned reply, promising that the lovely Alyce would be at the spot
appointed.  To this spot it was Brassinjaw's intention to go instead, as
if sent by Alyce, with an excuse for the unavoidable disappointment.
Thus then they parted; the one to make his ultimate arrangements for his
intended flight, the other to count his gains, and laugh at the credulity
of his wealthy dupe. When at his lodging, comfortably seated before a
rich repast, the priest bethought himself of a little amusement, in reading
over the undelivered letter of Sir Filbut, when, thrusting his hand into
the bosom of his vest, he was somewhat surprised to find it not there;
but recollecting that he had placed it between the leaves of his breviary,
that he usually carried under his arm, he took it up, but although he
examined it leaf by leaf, no letter could he find. He rated himself








                                           <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>

soundly for his own carelessness; but there being no help for the mishap, he consoled himself with an extra glass or two of Rhenish wine, and
soon forgot his vexation in sleep.  The letter had fallen from the book
upon the floor of Alyce's apartment, and, as the reader is aware, was
there found by her. When the appointed hour had arrived, the affairs
of his chapel on the Bridge caused him for a time to delay his meeting
with Sir Filbut; at last he started to the trysting-place, when what was
his surprise to see in the distance Alyce weeping, and at her feet Sir
Filbut Fussy.   Almost at the same instant the knight arose, and
hurried from the place; and then had Brassinjaw, bursting with rage,
for he believed he had himself been duped by Alyce, approached her,
and sent forth such a volley of holy denunciations, and appalling anathemas against her for her deceit, that the poor simple-minded creature fell
at his feet in a deadly swoon, as he was declaring he saw behind her the
Evil Fiend, standing ready to bear away her guilty soul.
 </p><p> "I thought," said Brassinjaw to the Abbess, "this faintingwas but one ot
your sex's often-repeated tricks to disarm us men of our anger, so I heeded
not her death-like trance, but waited patiently her own pleasure to recover;
when she did, I renewed my maledictions.  She protested her innocence
of knowing aught she had not already confessed, which really was nothing. But I still believed myself deceived; the more so, as I told her,
on account of my having met a strange woman with her child, who when
questioned whither she was taking it, replied, ' to its mother.' This
alarmed her greatly, but, as I thought, only because I had discovered her
intent; so, as a last resource to drive her to divulge all, I enjoined her
our severest penance.  Your Convent being close at hand, I led her
hither; you had been absent for some weeks, nor were you soon expected
to return.  I placed her, unseen, in the secret apparition cell, telling her
that if she kept back but a single word, or refused to confess what she
had done with the child, the fiend would ere long appear before her
eyes.  I left her there for some hours alone in utter darkness; when I
thought her mind was wrought up by terror to the proper pitch, I then,
by the magic lantern's aid, first caused a speck of light to appear upon
the wall of the cell.  I listened, and could hear her teeth chattering
with fear.  'Oh, save me! save me!' she exclaimed; but when I
caused the spectre to start suddenly into gigantic form, she uttered one
fearful cry, and fell as if dead upon the floor. I now found I had miscalculated the strength of the mind upon which I had been working;
and yet I should have known it, for Dame Alyce has been in my leading
strings for this many a year; but my rage and passion blinded me.  An
ague fit was on her frame, a stupor appeared to have seized upon every
fibre of her brain; kindness, nor threats, could force her to utter a single
word, excepting ' Save me, save me !' This she ever repeats upon hearing
my voice, after having uttered a wild and fearful scream. Eoline alone
knew of her being here, until your return, and fully believes the tale
she told to you, that it was some poor demented thing that I had found
wandering about homeless and friendless. The truth is, I had now
involved myself in a labyrinth of perplexities, from which I knew not
how to extricate myself; so that day by day slipped by without my being








 <pb id="p.136" n="136"/>                   .

  able to determine upon what course to steer my way.  You now know
  all. Advise, and I will follow your advice, be it what it may."
   </p><p> " Had you told me all this before," said the Abbess, "how much
  anxiety you might have saved yourself. I see no difficulty in the case
  at all; keep your own counsel, know nothing of what has transpired, and
  leave the rest to me. But remember, my house is in ruins, and must be
  rebuilt; you may guess my meaning. Your attempt at deceiving me
  must and shall be paid for. Sir Filbut's gold will shine as brightly in
  my chapel as in yours."
 </p><p>   Father Brassinjaw vowed by every saint he could bring to memory,
 how liberal he intended to be; and so finding his fears greatly diminished by the promised assistance of the Abbess, he took his leave, and
 feeling, as he very often did, in want of a little stimulant to support his
 weary spirit, he determined to solace himself for one hour more in the
 lower room of the Cardinal's Hat, where for the present we must leave
 him, and return to Harry Horton, who, upon quitting the burning Convent, joined his companion in iniquity, Beltham Spikely, to whom he
 related how completely he had been foiled by the scheming Abbess of
 St. Clair. " All I pray the fiends to grant," said Horton, "is that she
 and all her crew may be burnt to cinders ere the morning. The only
 difficulty I had to surmount to reach wealth and distinction, was the
 proof of that girl's existence or of her certain death; and now to have
 found her thus unexpectedly, and then to have the whole game torn from
 my hands, and given to that degraded being, the Cripple of the Bridge,
 is maddening. But I will thwart them yet, with all their cunning.
 Although the estates are lost to me for ever, I still possess documents
 without which she can never prove her title, and those shall be this
 night destroyed. At least I'll be revenged, if not enriched."
  </p><p> " Where are they ?" enquired Spikely.
  </p><p> " Still in the merchant's house, sewn in the sacking of my bed. Not
wanting them before, and having had enough of other affairs to think
upon of late, I had in truth forgotten them entirely. But as the night
is dark, and the merchant abroad, I can once more safely mount to my
old dormitory from the sterling of the Bridge, and, unknown to any one,
bring away not merely those papers, but the rich diamond and the
letters of the fool---"
</p><p>   "Why do you tremble ?" exclaimed Spikely, as he felt Horton's hand
convulsively seize upon his arm, as if to steady himself.
 </p><p>  " Have we not both cause to tremble ?" was Horton's reply, uttered
almost in a whisper; "have we not both cause to tremble after this
morning's work ? How could he have escaped from the vessel ? But
fate had doomed him to fall; and that was why we met him so unex
pectedly in the wood. But I wish his blood had not been spilt by us."
 </p><p> " By you, you mean," said Spikely, coolly. " I had no hand in his
death, further than when I saw him coming, just pointing out that if he
were allowed to blab, not even Cromwell's power could save your own
neck. But fear nothing; thanks to my precaution in rifling the body of
every valuable upon it, suspicion will at once fall upon your common
cutthroats, who, it is well known, would kill a dozen men for a dozen








                                           <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>

gold nobles. Depend upon it, when the body shall be found, which may
not be yet for many a day, it will end exactly as I have foretold."
 </p><p>  " Heaven grant it may !" said Horton, attempting to cross himself.
 </p><p>" It is the first blood I have ever shed, and at certain moments my eyes
 seem swimming in it, and I feel like a---"
</p><p>   " Coward !" said Spikely, with a sneer.
</p><p>   "Coward, I am none," replied Horton; "and that, even you may
 one day learn, if you chafe me thus. Let us in here," he continued, as
 they were passing a wine shop; " the cold has seized upon my heart."
 They entered, and Horton took two whole glasses of strong spirits, which
 for a time seemed to renew the powers of both mind and body. "How's
 the tide now ?" he inquired of the helper.
</p><p>   " It's at the flood," was the reply.
 </p><p>  " Then let us take boat directly," said Horton to his companion; " we
can safely remain beneath the Bridge at this part of the tide, and need
not enter the Cardinal's Hat. I'd rather not be seen near the place at
all to-night."
 </p><p>  The night was very dark, which favoured Horton's plan. When they
had entered beneath the sixth arch, they tied the boat to a ring in the
pier, and having found the well-known secreted rope, which still remained
in its old place, Horton, with all the dexterity attainable by long
practice, mounted speedily towards the little window of his former sleeping room. He was soon within the apartment, and having provided
himself with a dark lantern, he gazed around. All seemed just as he had
left it. " Spikely is right," he said, " I am a coward, or why should I
tremble now ?  1 know not why, and yet my nerves are all quivering.
Let me be quick; where is my knife ?"  He drew from its scabbard a
blade which answered the purposes of knife or dagger, which slipping
fiom  his hand, fell and stuck upright in the floor; by accident his
foot kicked sharply against it, when the blade snapped in two, leaving a portion still in the ground; as he stooped to seize the handle,
he had nearly fallen, for the steel was covered with blood. " I-I-'ll
tear the sacking open," he said; " that dagger must be used no more, the
Thames shall bury it for ever from man's sight." He flung it from
the window, then hurriedly approaching the bed, he threw off the coverlid,
when his eyes seemed blasted by the horrid spectre he there beheld-it
was the dead body of the very man he had that morning slain ! The cry or
horror that he now uttered was the one which had so startled the merchant and those above. Horton knew not where he was, his brain seemed
suddenly on fire; he flew to the casement, and seizing the rope, flung himselfheadlong forth, his body dashed against the pier, and he fell stunned
into the boat. Spikely comprehended in an instant that some untoward
circumstance had taken place, so slipping the rope from the ring, he pulled
with all his might through the Bridge towards Westminster. So severe
had been the fall, that it was some length of time ere Horton recovered
sufficiently to relate what he had seen; but to account for the appearance of the dead knight in such a place he found impossible, unless, indeed, he chose to allow his reason to be led captive by the superstition
of the times, and believe at once that he had witnessed an apparition








<pb id="p.138" n="138"/>                    .

sent from  another world.   Spikely scouted such childish thoughts,
and undertook himself to discover the right solution of this ghostly
riddle.
 </p><p> When the merchant and those with him had recovered from the surprise into which Horton's cry had for a moment thrown them, they felt
convinced that the sound had proceeded from the chamber into which
the Bridge-shooter had had the body of the knight removed, on account
of the expected return of the merchant and his beloved Alyce.  The
Bridge-shooter, taking up a lamp, was about to hasten to the room of
death, when Flora screamed with fright at the thought of her William
placing himself in such danger; the truth was, Flora had at once made
up her mind that the horrid shriek had been uttered by the unhappy
spirit of the murdered knight, and she thought it a tempting of fate to
interfere in any way further than telling her beads, and running over a
hundred or two prayers for the soul of poor Sir Filbut, whom she was
sure was then suffering the pains of purgatory. The rest having different
ideas upon the subject, left her trembling where she stood, and hurried to
Horton's room. Here they, for some time, were at a loss how to explain
what they had heard, until, perceiving that the coverlid had been removed
from off the body, which the Bridge-shooter declared he had himself
carefully placed over it, they were convinced that some mortal hand had
been employed; and of this they were soon made certain, by discovering
the dark lantern which Horton in his fright had let fall. The window,
too, was open; so they at once made up their minds that another
attempt to rob the house had been meditated, and that, in all probability, the unexpected finding of the murdered knight had so alarmed
the thief, that being taken off his guard, he had uttered the ejaculation
they had heard, and consequently felt it necessary for his own safety
to make a precipitate retreat. The window was soon strongly secured,
and the whole dwelling having been strictly searched, even Flora retired
to rest with a tolerable feeling of security.
 </p><p> The investigation which took place concerning the death of Sir Filbut
Fussy, ended exactly as had been predicted by Spikely. The absence
of every valuable from the body of Sir Filbut was deemed proof conclusive that he had met with his death at the hands of common robbers.
The Abbess had, also, proved a correct prophetess, for the tale she told
met with perfect credence from the merchant, the only person who had a
right, or felt any inclination, to enter upon the subject. Indeed, so
plausibly had the Abbess framed her tale, that the merchant not only
thanked her in words for her care of his afflicted wife, but bestowed a
large sum towards the rebuilding of the part of the Convent which had
been destroyed. The mind of Alyce, which appeared to be paralyzed,
showed no symptoms of recovery; her whole day was ever passed in
silence. The only slight alteration which took place in the expression of
her eyes, was upon the approach of her dog, who never seemed happy
but when lying at his mistress' feet.
 </p><p> Horton, finding it would be impossible to dissolve the marriage between
Eoline and the Cripple of the Bridge, consented to desist from further
persecution, upon condition that the Abbess still kept fast his secret.

 This she undertook to do; Horton promising to protect her and her nuns
 against the powers that were now rising up against them.
  </p><p> Having brought this epoch of our tale to a conclusion, we must here
 give our pen a rest, and for a few years bid farewell to all our friends on
 OLD LONDON BRIDGE.</p>

</p><p> NEVER had the sun been known to shine more brightly, nor the sky to
 look clearer or serener, than it did towards the latter end of August,
 <date value="1539">1539</date>. Could it have been the beauty of the day, for fine weather ever
 has a powerful influence upon the spirits of poor mortals, or some other
 cause, which had thrown the inhabitants of Old London Bridge into such
 a happy vein ?  No doubt the glorious sun had its usual share in adding
 to the delight felt upon this occasion; but there was a second, and a most
 powerful reason for being merry, which we shall very soon explain.
 There was one odd circumstance about the doings of the good folks of the
 Bridge, which to a stranger would have conveyed the idea that the whole
 of the inhabitants were, in a body, about to emigrate. Not a door was
 to be seen without a cart, or truck, or porter, standing near it, each being
 loaded with the various articles brought from the different shops; but, perhaps, from none came forth greater quantities, nor more valuable commodities, than issued out of the dwelling of Master William Hewet, clothworker and merchant.  The fact is, the 24th of August was near, and
 whom, we should like to know, was there then living in London, not
 aware that that day was the one dedicated to St. Bartholomew ?  Now,
 it so happened, that some good four hundred years before our tale
 began, a certain King Henry the First, of England, had a certain jester,
 named Rahere.    Rahere thinking he could do something better for
 himself than to be laughed at all his life, turned monk, and built a most
 magnificent priory with other people's money.  The King gave him the
 ground, which at that time was a most unpromising spot on one side of
 Smithfield, the only dry part of which is said to have been ornamented
 by a gallows, on which thieves were hanged. But a few pretended miracles soon produced a real one; for we find that, ere long, this penniless
 monk managed to raise a structure which, for grandeur and riches, could
 be surpassed but by few in all the land.  This magnificent edifice he dedicated to St. Bartholomew. Every privilege the King could bestow upon
 this Prioryhe did bestow, and many indeed were the privileges a crowned
 head then possessed; some of them have odd-sounding names to our modern
 ears, such as soccage and saccage, and thol and theme, and infangtheof,
 fordwit, hengwit, ward-penny, ave-penny, bloodwite, fightwite, and
childwite, thring-penny, manbratre, and mischinige, schewinge, frithsoke,






<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>               .

 and westgeilteof, not forgetting forefenge and whitfonge!  All
taxes were remitted, for, strange as it may appear, the monks in their
days disliked paying taxes quite as much as the laity does in our
own.
  </p><p> Now, there was another peculiarity about the monks of old, and that
was, that whilst there was a chance of getting anything more, they were
never satisfied with what they had; so the Prior of St. Bartholomew,
being perfectly aware that the greater the number of persons he could
get to visit the Monastery on St. Bartholomew's day, the more would
his shrine be loaded by offerings, hit upon the expedient of asking from
the King the permission to establish a FAIR in and about his holy
dwelling. The grant was obtained from Henry the Second, and thus
was established the well-known Bartholomew, or, as it is vulgarly called,
Bartlemy Fair, which continued to be holden for more than seven hundred years; indeed, until within these last few years.
  </p><p> A fair in the olden time was a very different thing to that which the
present generation has witnessed. Now, it is a mere collection of gingerbread stalls, and here and there a locomotive playhouse; but some
hundred years ago, a great portion of the mercantile wealth of the kingdom found its way, en grosse, or, as we should say now, wholesale, to
'these receptacles of every useful article, and thence was distributed in
small parcels, or retail, east, west, north, and south.  The two main objects of this fair, after the one of bringing crowds to the shrine of St.
Bartholomew, were for the collection and disposal of woollen cloths and
cattle.  The first grant was for three days-the eve of the Saint's day,
the day itself, and the morrow; but, notwithstanding all the efforts made
by the city authorities, for the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs possessed great
power over this fair, the worthy traders and showmen found so much
profit, and the citizens so much amusement, and pleasant opportunities
for spending their money, that the three days were soon extended to
fourteen.
 </p><p> As nearly all the clothworkers and drapers of the kingdom congregated at Bartlemy Fair, it was but natural to suppose that one of the
principal shearmen, as clothworkers were called, until joined to the trade
or mystery of the fullers, which happened in <date value="1528">1528</date>, such an one as
honest Master William Hewet, would not be found wanting; consequently,
we find the largest stall or standing in the Churchyard of the Priory,
adorned not only by that worthy name, but also by the identical sign of
the Golden Fleece and the Bag of Wool, which had been brought from
the merchant's house on the Bridge, and fixed over his stall.  This was
done to show the country trader that it was the same honest merchant
and no impostor, who now offered to their notice his costly wares.
 </p><p> Having said thus much as a sort of preface to the fair, the reader will
no longer wonder what could have been the cause of such a seeming
general removal from Old London Bridge. Masters Catchemayde, Silkworm, Checklocke, and the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker, had entered
into partnership, and built a stall with four sides, so that their four
several trades, or mysteries, were combined under one roof, and yet kept
separate.
 </p><p> So extensive had Bartlemy Fair become at the period of which we are








                                            <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>

writing, that it stood in no less than four parishes-Christ Church, Great
St. Bartholomew, Little St. Bartholomew, and St. Sepulchre's.  Busy
indeed were all the traders of London, as well as those of the Bridge,
removing their most tempting commodities to their stalls in Smithfield.
The artists and picture-dealers hurried towards the cloisters of Christ
Church, for these were the galleries appropriated to the pictorial exhibition. Several times, during the day we are speaking of, had the Bridge
been completely choked up by the numberless shows, each professing, by
external decoration, that that one was the greatest wonder in the whole
world. On they passed, and on posted multitudes of country people, all
laden with baskets filled with butter, cheese, fruits, and poultry; but
the last was a rare and dear article; but then it was coming to a market
where there would be plenty of rich customers, so it was sure to be disposed of. A few droves of cattle, too, wended their way across the
Bridge; but the greater portion of this sort of merchandise came from the
north, so the Bridge was not greatly troubled by them.
 </p><p> A little incident occurred exactly opposite the merchant's dwelling,
which raised the Bridge-shooter's indignation; but being alone in charge
of the house, he could not leave it to interfere. This was, that as one of
the most splendidly-adorned caravans was passing the Golden Fleece, on
which was written in letters of gold, " THE GREATEST WONDERS IN THE
WORLD!     The   Real WOOD      MONSTER      and  the  INFANT
VENUS," a violent screaming of a girl who was suffering from blows
that could be distinctly heard, issued from the said caravan; and these
words were uttered by the woman who might be supposed to be inflicting
the chastisement :-" I'll teach you, you blue-eyed minx, to look out of
the window: who do you think will pay to see your ugly face, if you
show it for nothing "  Then came more abuse, more blows, and more
screaming, as the caravan passed on its way towards the fair.
 </p><p> All this happened on the day previous to the eve of St. Bartholomew's
day. Just before twelve o'clock at night, crowds of the lower orders
hastened towards Cloth Fair, a name that has descended to our own time,
and may be found attached to a very dirty little street, or lane, adjacent
to Bartholomew Close, for here it was that as the hour struck which killed
the night and straight gave birth to a new-born day, out rushed from a
house of entertainment a number of tailors, shears in hand; the leader,
addressing the crowd, proclaimed the opening of the fair. Having done
this, the whole party of tailors snapped their shears, and with a loud shout
retraced their steps to the drinking-house.  The rabble, also shouting,
now scampered off towards Smithfield, knocking and ringing at every
house door in their road, to the great discomfiture and alarm of the sober-
minded inmates. When arrived in Smithfield, here the rabble in their
turn proclaimed the fair duly opened, and then passed several hours in
riot and disorder.  The lawful proclamation did not take place until the
afternoon, and this was done with much state and splendour, according
to the following order:-
 </p><p> " The Aldermen meete the Lord Maior and the Sheriffes at the Guildhall Chappel, at two of the clocke after dinner, having on their violet
gowns lined, and their horses, but without their cloakes, and there they
heare evening prayer. Which being done, they mount on their horses, and,








<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>                   .

riding to Newgate, passe forth of the gate. Then entering into the Clothfayre, there they make a proclamation, which proclamation being ended,
they ride thorow the Cloth-fayre, and so returne backe againe thorow the
Churchyard of great Saint Bartholomewes to Aldersgate: and then ride
home againe to the Lord Maior's house."
 </p><p>  The proclamation above referred to was read by the Lord Mayor's
attorney, at the great gate going into Cloth Fair, Smithfield, and commanded that " all persons, of whatsoever estate, degree, or condition they
be, should keep the peace of their sovereign Lord the King;" and then forbad any one from selling " wine, ale, or beer, but in measures ensealed, as
by gallon, pottle, quart, or pint, upon pain that will fall thereof."  No
bread was to be sold, but such as was "good and wholesome for Man's
Body."   No cook, pie-maker, nor huckster, was to sell any " victual,
unless it be good and wholesome for Man's Body," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; and
concluded by informing all who might feel aggrieved during the continuance of the fair, they could meet with redress at the Court of Pie Powder."
This was a temporary court of record, properly then called Pepoudres, or
Pedes Pulverisati, meaning that justice was there as quickly done, as
dust can fly from the feet. The proclamation being ended, the fair began
in right earnest. Every conceivable voice that the ingenuity of man, woman, or child could invent, was brought into requisition. Gongs, cymbals, trumpets, drums, whistles, rattles, bawlings, cryings, screamings,
laughings, shoutings, all burst forth, as if let loose by the spell of silence
being broken by the cessation of the proclamation. The whole space of
Smithfield was surrounded, first by a row of small stalls, filled with
thousands of various articles; here a line ofjewellers' stalls, there a row
of those appropriated to toys for children. Cake stalls were innumerable
-but oh, what a glorious sight was to be witnessed at Pasty-nooke,
or Pie-corner! It was there you could find at one view some hundreds
of smoking, savoury-smelling, little roasted pigs-always hot, always
ready, always delicious, and always disappearing into stomachs whose
dimensions seemed to increase upon every coming mouthful. It was at
this corner that the great fire of London terminated; and some of the
very houses which witnessed the preparation of these delicious little
pigs. were standing within these last forty years.
  </p><p> At the backs of these smaller stalls stood the grand exhibitions and
shows, their fronts towards the open space of Smithfield cattle market;
but the cattle caused but little inconvenience to the gay throng, for be it
remembered that much less meat was consumed at that time, for London
was then not quite so big as it is at this day, and Smithfield was a great
deal bigger. It may not be out of place here to mention, that the term
" Smithfield " comes not, as many have supposed, from  the name of
Smith, but is really a corruption of "SMOOTH-FIELD," that place having
been kept as smooth as possible, on account of the jousts and tournaments
and other exhibitions requiring a clear smooth field of action. Many of
the shows would, in these our days, produce an odd effect-for instance,
a representation of the " Old Creation of the World new Revived,
containing the creation of Adam and Eve; the intrigues of Lucifer in
the garden of Eden; King Herod's cruelty, his men's spears laden with
children; Rich Dives in hell, and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom;"








                                            <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>

  mixed up with "figures dancing jigs, sarabands, antics and country
  dances, with Spendall and Punchinello ;" an odd mixture of subjects for
  a show at a fair. But the monks of old had prepared the public for such
  sights in their churches, so they were now looked upon as matters of course
  everywhere, and relished highly. A live hare beating a tabour while
  standing on his hinder legs, was a favourite exhibition, and remained so for
  many hundreds of years; as did the same thing we see at this day in the
  streets, namely, a man throwing up three or four balls, and as many
knives, and catching them in all manner of directions.
 </p><p>   Edward Osborne and his master were too busily employed in the
  close-yard of the Priory, attending to their numerous country connection,
  who came now to lay in their stock of goods for the ensuing year, to take
  much notice of the fooleries of the outward fair.  Not so Flora Gray and
  the Bridge-shooter; their very hearts, as much as love had left them of
  such commodities, seemed wrapped up in the delights of Bartlemy Fair.
  Every moment they could spare was devoted to that fascinating spot;
  and as the only pleasure the afflicted Alyce seemed to feel, was that of
  wandering about, Flora made the amusement of her mistress a sort of
  innocent excuse for being out in the fair from morning till night. Alyce's
  fancy, as well as they could guess from the very few words she ever
  spoke, was that her's was a body walking the earth without a soul, but
  that her soul would again be her own, if she could but discover something
  that was lost. What that something might be, no persuasion on their
  parts could ever tempt her to name; if they tried to lead her to that
  subject, she would invariably place her finger upon her lip, and smiling
  for a moment, sink suddenly into a deep reverie, and mutter to herself,
  "Oh, my poor lost soul! but time-time-time; yes, it shall yet be
  found."  Then for hours after not a syllable would pass her lips. She
  never appeared to have the least command over her memory. The names
  of all around her she knew, but invariably applied them to the wrong
  persons.  Often would she address Edward as though he were her husband, and speak of her husband by the name of Horton. It was strange,
  but there were three names she never uttered-those of her child, Sir
  Filbut, and the saintly Father Brassinjaw.  Once, the good merchant,
  thinking that perhaps the pious converse of the priest of St. Thomas of
  the Bridge, much as he himself disliked him, might bring comfort to his
  adored wife, pressed Father Brassinjaw to try his power.  The priest
  would have gladly been excused, but not being able to form any plausible
  excuse, reluctantly attended.  The moment he appeared before Alyce,
  and she caught the sound of his voice, she was seized with raging madness, rushed into the darkest corner of the room, and there crouched
  down, trembling in every limb, and exclaiming that the fiend who had
  her soul was still standing behind her. This had occurred soon after her
  restoration to her home, and having been tried a second time with exactly
  similar effects, the experiment was never again repeated. She, after a
  time, became again composed, but never ceased to be, as it were, searching for something she had lost.  When she fancied she was perfectly
  alone and unseen, then she would steal about on tiptoe, and look into
  every corner of the place. Nothing that she could open was left unexamined. At the slightest sound, she would hurry back to her seat, and

smile with delight at having, as she seemed to imagine, cheated those
who would keep her from finding what she desired.  The fair gave her
great happiness, for here there was an endless opportunity of searching.
The good merchant, seeing this, gave Flora ample means to gratify his
Alyce, who, protected by the Bridge-shooter, passed her whole time there.
At night she would return home worn out with fatigue, but the fatigue
always produced a sound sleep, which appeared to benefit her strength
of body, if not her mind.  Every morning she was the first ready to
sally forth on her beloved search. One day, towards the close of the
fair, they were stopped by a crowd, dragging along some one towards the
Court of the Pye-Powder, to answer for an alleged impropriety of conduct,
and whom should this turn out to be but our friend, the Cripple of the
Bridge-gate Tower. The Bridge-shooter, seeing him in custody, could
not think of leaving a friend in such a plight; so quitting Alyce and
Flora for a time, he accompanied the Cripple to the Court.  It appeared that the complainant was the manager of the exhibition of the
"REAL WOOD MONSTER       and the   INFANT VENUS;" and as the
Wood Monster (so ran the man's account) had the night before overeaten himself, at his evening repast of sawdust and the bark of trees
(the real truth was, the man had been so dead drunk, that he was
scarcely living at that moment) he could not appear before the public.
In order that his audience should have a monster of some sort, he had
applied to the Cripple of the Bridge to come and act for a day or two at
an enormous salary; but this offer had so insulted the Cripple, that he at
once broke the head of the complainant, and would, in all likelihood, have
murdered him outright, had the crowd not interfered.  Now, the Court
of the Pye--Powder, as we have before remarked, made short work or
justice, so at once fined the poor fellow with the broken head, for daring
to insult any one holding an official situation.  The man with the broken
head could not quite understand the justness of this decision, but well
knowing how useless remonstrance would prove, and might very likely
add the stocks to his other sufferings, paid the fine and left the Court,
rubbing his head and grumbling like a bear.
 </p><p> After the Bridge-shooter had left Flora, she led her mistress, who was
as docile as an infant, towards the very show of the Monster and the
Venus. Here Alyce gazed with childish delight at the gay dresses of the
paraders in front of the show, and Flora was debating in her own mind
which exhibition she should patronise first, that which gave her mistress
such pleasure, or the next one, into which crowds were flocking.  The
show next to the Monster was a most extraordinary one to be at a fair,
and one that could never have been thought of but in this year of the
persecution of all the religious orders in the kingdom.  The exterior of the
building was painted to represent a monastery, and here, it was announced, a "mystery" would be enacted by "real monks and real
nuns," showing the world how jollily they used to live before their
houses were suppressed, and explaining all the deceits they had practised
to delude the world." Such extraordinary stories had been told of late,
for the purpose of setting the public against the poor nuns and monks,
that this novel speculation proved an enormous "hit."  These poor
creatures had been doubtless what they professed, for at this time

 thousands of the various orders were wandering about in a state of abject
 want and starvation, so that a designing speculator need not have looked
 far to have found as many as ever he might have required. At this
 moment, Edward Osborne happened to pass, and stopped for an instant
 to gaze with sorrow upon his dear mistress, who was quite absorbed
 with the gay sights she beheld. She took no notice of Edward, but exclaimed, "There, there," and pointed towards a man who now advanced to the front of the Monster show.  This man was splendidly
 dressed in green velvet and gold; and on his head he wore a richly
trimmed hat, with a superb and lofty plume of feathers; his face was
tolerably handsome, what with the paint upon his cheeks, and the neatly
trimmed beard, and elegant moustache. He was just about to address
the crowd, when a clown, jumping upon his shoulders, popped his hand
before his mouth-this caused a roar of laughter; as this told so admirably with the audience, it was repeated several times; at last as the people
appeared to cease laughing, the clown, the last time he jumped up,
tumbled over the head of the gentleman in green, and in doing so, caught
hold of his beard and moustache, and pulled them off; then ran about,
pursued by the gentleman, who ordered the clown to be placed in the
stocks at the end of the platform, and then began to re-adjust his beard,
&amp;c., amidst the laughter of the people.
   </p><p> While lie was doing this, young Osborne said to Flora, "It's very
 strange, but that face, without the beard, reminds me strongly of one I
 have seen before, but where, or when, or under what circumstances, I
 cannot bring to mind; but I am certain we have met before." The
 gentleman in green and gold, having replaced his moustache, began to
 address the company.  The moment the moustache and beard were
 on, the resemblance which had appeared to Osborne, vanished; so, advising Flora not to go to the exhibition of the nuns, but rather to enter
 the one before them, he pursued his way to rejoin his master at his stall
 in the Priory Churchyard.
   </p><p> The man in green said, "My right worshipful and dearly-beloved
 friends, on most occasions, when I come forward to proclaim a disappointment, I do it with exquisite pain; but now I do so with unutterable delight, because the disappointment will be no disappointment, but
 a wonderful gain to you.  You are doubtless fully aware of the unlooked-for misfortune that has befallen the greatest wonder in the world
 -the REAL WOOD MONSTER ?    But I see you are, so I will touch upon
 that painful subject no further, but tell you what I have done for you.
 When your pleasures are in the scale, what care I for trouble-what
 care I for money ?  I would starve rather than you, my patrons, should
 be disappointed; so I have engaged-ha ! ha! ha ! he ! he ! he !"-
 here he pretended to go into a most violent fit of laughter-" oh, dear!
 oh, dear! how can I pronounce that wonderful name! But it must
 out-yes, it must out, though I burst in the effort"-here he once more
 pretended to become speechless from laughing, and did it so well, that
 the laugh became infectious, and an universal roar was the consequence;
 then wiping the tears from his eyes, the man in green and gold went on
 -" Yes, I have engaged him; I have, indeed; but my mouth is too
 small to pronounce so great a name. Oh, ye spirits of magic, that obey







<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>                   .

my commands, aid me-aid me !"     The words were scarcely uttered,
when a gigantic placard flew up to the top of the show, and on it appeared the words DIDDLE'EM      DOWNY!!!       Never, during the
present fair, had been heard such a shout of applause and laughter as
this placard produced. The man in green proved himself green in nothing
but his dress, for he had been working up to this point to introduce his
newly engaged "star"; so, now the enthusiasm seeming to be at the
highest, up drew a canvass curtain, and sure enough, there was the far-
famed ' DIDDLE'EM DOWNY," seated upon his travelling jackass.  Need
we say that the roar and applause now became redoubled, or that the
steps were instantly besieged by crowds of anxious people, ready to pay
their last penny rather than not witness the performance of one of whom
fame spoke so highly ?
 </p><p> This Diddle'em Downy was, in truth, no other than our old acquaintance Knowy, the flying newsman. It may be remembered that poor
Knowy had, when we last saw him, entered upon the SCANDAL TRADE,
which, like most scandal merchants, he found, for a time, a very lucrative employment; but by degrees becoming bolder and bolder, he began
to take liberties with those who not only had the will, but the power to
resent his insults; so that scarcely a week passed without witnessing
Master Knowy in the stocks, or with his back as black as his own ink,
from sundry good cudgellings. Now, this he might have put up with, for
what will not those scamps, we mean all who live by pandering to the
vilest feelings of their readers, not do for money? But Knowy,
on one unlucky day, happening to touch upon the irregularities of his
Grace the King, found himself whipped within, we may say, half an inch
of his life, at the cart's tail, and the pleasing intimation given to him, that
if he meddled with scandal again, he would discover a cravat round his
neck, that he would find rather difficult to untie; so he determined to
alter his course of life, and thenceforth became a celebrated comic singer.
He had been fortunate enough to make an enormous hit, with the first
song he wrote and sang; he henceforward was known only by the name
mentioned in that song; and as this ditty was called " London Rogueries,
or the Life and Adventures of Diddle 'em Downy," we may presume
that of many of the rogueries therein rehearsed, he could vouch for the
truth, for we suspect he had been the principal actor himself.
</p><p>  So widely had the fame of this song, "Diddle 'em Downy," flown,
that the arrival in Bartlemy Fair of the celebrated singer thereof, was
hailed with acclamations. He knew full well that a little eccentricity
in any way, always has a powerful effect in fixing the remembrance of
any one, in others minds, so he invariably travelled upon an ass; wore a
coat of a fashion quite his own, which was profusely ornamented with
imitation gold and jewels; but the greatest point of attraction, was his
originality in wearing a blue wig, with a pink tail! This was, doubtless,
intended as a satire upon the introduction of wigs; for this article of
adornment, which, in the time of the Charleses became universal, was
unknown in England until the reign of Henry the Eighth. The curtain
was allowed to remain up but a very few minutes, for the sight of such
a brilliant star as Diddle 'em Downy, was not to be viewed for nothing.
 </p><p> Bong-gingle-bong-gingle-bong-gingle went the gong and cymbals,







                                            <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>

 trumpets sounded, fifes played; the man in green and gold walked
 proudly backwards and forwards, flourishing a long cane, and ever and
 anon pointed with exultation up to the placard; then placing his hand
 to the side of his mouth bawled out, in a voice that seemed to be passing
 fiom a throat lined with sand-paper-" Just going to begin! just going
 to begin ! all in ! all in ! all in !"-The clown was released from the
 stocks--the band of musicians vanished through a slit in the canvass--
 the man in green and gold heading his troop of actors, passed once along
 the platform in great state, and then entered the show through another
slit in the canvass-the clown was the last, who, pretending to cry
bitterly, swore to the people that he was now utterly ruinated, for his
master had found a greater fool than himself.
  </p><p> So great had been the rush, that the common expedient of making two
 or three false entries, as if going to begin," in order to tempt the
 audience to enter, was not called into requisition; for indeed, the master
 of the show soon discovered, that the more frequently he could really
 begin, the more considerable would be his gains.
 </p><p>  It was not to be expected that Flora Gray should resist the temptation
 of taking her mistress into such a delightful show. Alyce appeared very
 pleased at being taken in, as indeed she did to any new place.  As they
 entered there were two money-takers, one on each side of the opening-
 a woman sat in one box, a man in the other; there being less crowd at
 the man's side than at the opposite, they here paid their money for two
 of the highest priced seats, and soon found themselves comfortably seated,
 to witness the wonderful performance of Diddle 'em Downy, and the no
 less extraordinary, but certainly more classical representation, of the
 rising of Venus from the sea, and her adornment by the three graces.
 </p><p>  The entertainment began with a "motion" performed by puppets;
 puppet-shows were called motions, representing Noah's Ark, the flood,
 the rising sun, and the sinking of the waters ; this was an every day
 sort of exhibition, so elicited but slight applause, as did the clown's dance
 upon his own head; no, no, Diddle 'em was the attraction in the comic
 line, the Venus in that of beauty.
  </p><p> At last Diddle 'em Downy appeared; but here our pen blushes at its
 own want of power to express even in a faint degree, the wonderful performance.  What words have ever been found to give any just idea of
 the peculiar excellence of a Betterton, a Garrick, a Liston, or a Kean ?
 No! an actor's genius cannot be set down in words; the wonderful
 expression of the eye, the varied intonation of the voice-the features'
 electric movement, speaking without a tongue-are things that must be
 seen or heard, to be comprehended.  If this be the case, it were useless
 to attempt a description of Downy's excellence. It is true, that we could
 say, how at the end of every verse he twisted his celebrated wig into a
 new position; but what position ? there's the point-what position !
 Any one could twist a wig, but no one could twist a wig as Downy did.
 Another misfortune under which we labour, is to find that his celebrated
 song was never printed; and although we have searched through every
 MS. in the British Museum, as well as in more than one foreign library
 --for Downy's fame, and himself too, visited foreign parts (ill-natured
 people say at the government expence), we have never been able to meet








<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>                   .

with it. All we know is, and this is merely traditional, that each verse
expressed a peculiar roguery, and ended with these emphatic words-
       </p><p>   <quote rend="blockquote"><l>   "* * * be they black, white, fair, or browny,
             </l><l>And tho' they got up with the lark in the morn,
                </l><l>Yet none could be up to Diddle'em Downy."</l></quote>
</p><p>
and then, as was usual with ancient lyric poetry, the words were repeal  again and again--
    </p><p>   <quote rend="blockquote"><l>        " Diddle 'em Downy, Diddle 'em Downy-
                 </l><l>None could be up to Diddle 'em Downy."</l></quote>
 </p><p> Three times was the song called for, and three times did Downy
vary the Rogueries, until the hearers began to think that the world was
made of nothing else.
 </p><p> After a pause, to allow the audience to sober down their feelings,
slow sweet music was heard, and again drew aside the curtain. All the
platform, or stage, appeared in mist, but this gradually cleared away, and
discovered the representation of a calm sunlit sea.  Presently, and this
part was very ingeniously contrived, dolphins and sea Gods rose from the
waves, and swam about to the great solace and delight of the audience.
So beautiful was all this preparation, that the beholders naturally expected the appearance of Venus to out do all they had yet seen; and so it
did; for now a splendid shell began to rise, all glittering with gold,
silver, and pearls, in which stood the youthful Venus, attended by the
Graces.
 </p><p> The girl who personated the Goddess of Beauty, was famed for the
splendour of her hair, so in order to show that off to the greatest advantage, she first appeared with it in loose ringlets, so luxuriant in their
growth, that they completely covered her whole figure, lower than her
waist.
  </p><p>Poor Alyce gazed at this scene with almost conscious interest; her
eyes were riveted upon the beautiful vision. As the music played a soft
and dulcet measure, the Graces throwing themselves into most picturesque
and elegant attitudes, began to part the golden tresses to display the
beautiful face of Venus. Flora was so taken up in watching the countenance of her mistress, whom she had never yet seen to evince such fixed
attention upon any one thing, forgot for a moment all about the show;
when suddenly Alyce uttered a shriek that paralyzed every heart, and
then franticly exclaimed-" Saved, saved! my soul is saved!" and
fell to the ground in a death-like swoon.
 </p><p>  All was now consternation-the audience rose in alarm-the curtain
was closed suddenly; so piercing had been the shriek of Alyce, that
other ladies in their fright began to scream too, and some even fainted.
The more brutal part of the assembly began to swear at having their
enjoyment interrupted, and said it was " only Hewet's mad wife at one
of her freaks."
 </p><p>  As Alyce was being conveyed out, the woman from the money-box,
came to offer her assistance, but the instant she met Flora's eyes, she
started back, and, after a moment's hesitation, vanished through the







                                             <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>

  crowd.  When they were in the open fair, Flora espied the Bridge-
  shooter searching for her; him she sent off to acquaint the merchant
  with what had taken place, and to beg of him to hasten to the Bridge.
  Alyce was soon conveyed home, where the merchant, with Edward and
  the Bridge-shooter had already arrived.
   </p><p> Alyce sat very still for a time, as if endeavouring to collect some
  wandering thoughts; she muttered "saved, saved! my soul is saved !"
  then she looked minutely at the features of every one present, examining
them again and again; then she passed her fair hand, in the manner of
  a blind person, gently over the face of her husband, as if to ascertain
  whether he were a vision, or a corporeal being; when who can paint the
  feeling of rapture that flew through the merchant's heart, as he heard
  her, who, for so long had seemed walking the earth unconsciously, as in
  a living death, say, " William, I have found it, I have found it !"
  </p><p> The poor merchant feared to speak; he dreaded to break the spell,
  which seemed to make his Alyce thus conscious for a moment, that he
  was present. At last he said, " Dear Alyce, tell me, tell me, what it
  is you have been ever seeking, and now say you have found ?"
  </p><p>  " You know," she replied, smiling faintly, and then almost whispering
  she continued, " I have found the salvation of my soul ?"
   </p><p> " In what ?" exclaimed the merchant.
   </p><p> Alyce first looked up to heaven, then flinging her arms around his neck,
  and bursting into a violent flood of tears, exclaimed " My child, my
  child !".
   </p><p> Nature seemed by some powerful effort, suddenly to have burst the
  barriers, that had so long pent up in Alyce's breast those floods of the
  heart's relief; fit after fit of weeping followed each other, in an almost
  uninterrupted succession.  The poor merchant's hopes again sank, as
  he fancied he heard but the outpourings of his wife's now hopeless
  madness.
   </p><p> " Good Heavens !" exclaimed Flora, " it may-it must be so. Master,"
  she continued, "there is more than madness in her words.  I believe,
  sincerely believe, that she has seen her child."  Flora then explained to
  Master Hewet all that had passed at the fair; that being so intent upon
  watching her mistress, she had scarcely looked at the stage, but what
  confirmed her in her belief was, the woman whom she had seen at the
  doorway, and whom she now felt certain was the same who had stolen
  away the child.
   </p><p> Not a moment was to be lost.     The Bridge-shooter, with Alice
  Vaughan, from the opposite dwelling, who had ever been most kind in
  her attentions to Alyce Hewet since her dreadful affliction, were left
  with the merchant's wife, while Hewet, with Flora and Edward Osborne,
  for Edward now said that he too had his suspicions that the mountebank in green and gold, would prove to be one of the wretches who had
  formerly attempted his murder, started again for the fair. As they went
  along they obtained the requisite assistance from the authorities, at the
  Court of Pye-Powder, to enable them to search the show for the lost child,
  and thus armed, they hastened to the booth.
  </p><p>  When they arrived there, "Diddle' em Downy," was once more in the
  middle of his song, but seeing officers of justice coming on to the stage,








<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>                  .

for reasons best known to Downy, he imagined that they could want no
one but himself, so jumped into the middle of the pit, and escaped by the
front of the show. When the woman wearing the dress as described by
Flora was produced, great was her disappointment to find a person in no
respect, but the dress, resembling the one who had taken the child. This
she declared was not the woman she had before seen so recently, but in
answer to this, everybody belonging to the booth swore that no other had
taken money at the door that day, and indeed no other ever had.  The
girl, too, that was now brought forward, as the youthful Venus, was but
very scantily entitled to bear the name; she was a rather plain bandylegged girl, and much older than Anne could have been. The poor
merchant's heart sank within his breast as he turned away. Edward
Osborne was doomed, also, to disappointment, for the man in green and
gold, when he had removed his moustache and beard, was very, very
unlike what he had fancied him to be, when, as he supposed, he had last
seen him.
 </p><p> They all returned in a most dejected state. The only one who seemed
to feel happier at the events of the day, was Alyce. A wonderful
change had taken place in her mind; which, although still unsettled and
wandering, was less frequently entirely lost. There was evidently
something in her own thoughts which brought a degree of comfort to her,
and even the merchant could not quite banish the hope that still she
might be restored to reason. It could not be denied that she now recognised every one who approached her; but could not be made to understand
why they kept her child from her; formerly she had never named it,
now she would scarcely speak of anything else. Once after a long silence
she took them all by surprise, by saying, " How wonderful she is grown
-and how beautiful she is-I wish she would come home."
 </p><p> The merchant gave up all hope of ever again seeing his child. Not
so Flora; nothing, she declared, " should ever make her doubt her own
eyes; that was the woman, she was certain; only, as they were conjurors, perhaps they had changed her for a time, but she should find her
out yet-and her dear little Anne too, or there was no truth in dreams,
or in cards neither."
 </p><p> The next day was the last of the fair, but Diddle 'em Downy having
absconded from fear, and the lack of beauty in the Venus being blown,
and for other reasons, easily to be guessed at, the monster show packed
up all its goods and chattels, and that very day left the ground.
 </p><p> The merchant had been more than usually fortunate; what with sales
and orders, this had proved the greatest year he had ever known; so
while he is busily counting up his gains, and preparing for the next day's
removal of the few remaining goods, not forgetting the celebrated sign of
the Golden Fleece and Bag of Wool, we will introduce the reader to a
new scene in man's chequered life.</p>

 "I WISH the devil had you, or you had longer legs; tramp on, I say !
 tramp, tramp !" This gentle exhortation was addressed to a poor child
 of some ten or twelve years of age, who was lagging behind a woman
 shabbily attired. This woman was rather past the middle age, but still
 retained the remains of much beauty, of the masculine kind; the girl
 appeared dejected, and from her limping gait, one might easily imagine
 her to be sadly fatigued, or that her naked feet were grievously pained
 by the sharp sand and stones of the ground over which she was
 travelling.
  </p><p> " Mother," said the girl, " I can't, indeed I can't walk faster, unless
you let me have my shoes; my feet are bleeding now, and the stones are
so sharp I can scarcely stand."
 </p><p>  " Just now," replied the woman, "you said your shoes hurt you;
you're always full of one fancy or the other: there, take'em," she said
brutishly throwing them down right upon the feet of the girl, who cried
out with pain as they struck against her ancles, " take 'em, and tramp
on quickly, or I'll-- "
  </p><p> "I will, I will !" replied the girl, rubbing the tears from her eyes with
the back or one hand, as she hurriedly pulled on the shoes with the other,
" I will try to do everything you wish, if you will but be kinder to me."
 </p><p>  " Kinder indeed ! a pretty deal I have to be kinder to you for," exclaimed the woman; " why, you've caused me more trouble, than all the
six husbands I have had put together.  One's generally trouble enough
for a woman; but all mine, excepting the last, were what husbands
ought to be, early croakers, and died off like gentlemen; no waiting to
be told to go. I buried three in one year;" then speaking to herself, she
said, "Bel's a tough 'un, but I shall see him out yet; it won't be long before
he calls here, at the half-way-house to the other world." As she said this,
she turned her head significantly towards a large venerable looking pile
-it was the Hospital of St. Giles's in the Fields, where the condemned
always took their last drink, on their way to execution at Tybourne.
 </p><p> It is strange to observe, how the march of refinement in London, has
followed in the wake of the gallows. The elms, or gallows of Smithfield,
was surrounded by all the pomp and grandeur of chivalry and regal
state. As the gallows journeyed westward, and settled at St. Giles's, the
court and high nobility travelled westward too; the last fixed home the
gallows found was at Tybourne, and here, has now sprung up an extensive city, as we may say, literally formed of palaces. The gallows may
at this instant be regarded as a homeless wanderer; true, it now and
then peeps out at Newgate, but as if ashamed of its very self, it quickly
vanishes again, and as its visits are now " few, and far between," let us







<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>.                 .

hope, ere long, to be able to view it only through the long glass of
memory, and talk of it as one of the barbarous things that were.
  </p><p>Having passeed the Hospital, or Religious house of St. Giles, the travellers soon found themselves in the way to Uxbridge, now called
Oxford Street. Along the whole mile and a quarter, the length of this
part of the road, there was not a house to be seen, with perhaps the
exception of a hedge ale-house, for the accommodation of thieves, as
much as for wayfarers. The road was but ill defined, for in many
parts it was entirely open to the fields, so that in bad weather, when
the part called the road became impassable, the horsemen and waggons
turned into the fields and made a road for themselves.
 </p><p> The woman and the girl pursued their way until they arrived at a
spot, fatal to many of their friends, the far-famed Tybourne Tree. Here
stood, amongst others, one enormous tree, and near it the three-sided
gallows.  The woman looking up at it, said-' I could fill those three
sides with jewels, that would hang there and be real ornaments to it;
and perhaps I may yet, who knows ?"  It was an odd locality for such
people to fix their camp in, but at some distance up the road, might be
perceived through the trees, an old worn out caravan or two, that had
seen better days, for on many parts small portions of gold still sparkled
in the sun, and had evidently been most attractive-looking articles at
fairs, many years before.
</p><p>  " I'm glad we're at home," said the woman, as they approached a
very old man, who was sitting upon the steps of one of the vans enjoying
the rays of the setting sun, who, starting at her voice, looked up, evidently
astonished at seeing her.
 </p><p> "What in the name of all the saints has brought you here to-day?'
he said; to which the woman replied-
 </p><p> " Rather enquire in the name or all the devils, for there's no good in
our visit, I can tell you ! it's all along with that girl there."
 </p><p> The girl looked at the woman imploringly, as if, although unconscious
of having done anything wrong, she feared a severe chastisement.
 </p><p> " Don't stand looking like a fool," said the woman to the girl, " I'm
too tired to beat you now: take off your shoes, there's no need of wearing
expensive articles when there's nothing to be got by it, and then to
your shed, and mind you go to sleep, for sleepers can do well enough
without eating.  The girl left them, and doing as she was told, crept
into the little gipsy sort of tent, where she began to cry and bewail her
wretched fate.
 </p><p> " But what's gone wrong ?" said the old man; " I had not looked for
you until to-morrow night at soonest."
 </p><p> " Plenty has gone wrong, but don't bother now," replied the woman;
"get something to eat, for we've had a long walk, and a hot one."
</p><p>  The old man ascended into the room of the caravan, and soon returned
with a couple of wooden trenchers, on which was some cold poultry, for,
as they took it wherever they found it, it did not signify to them it
being a dear commodity  this, added to a large flask of wine, made a
tolerably tasty repast, and to it they both sat down upon the grass, and
enjoyed it exceedingly. Being on an elevated part of the ground, their
view extended a long way up the road towards London; the woman







                                                <pb id="p.153" n="153"/>

casting a glance in that direction, rose from her seat, and placing her
hand over her eyes to shelter them from the glare of the sun, exclaimed,
" There is more wrong yet, for yonder I see one coming, who never to
my knowledge, left his platter while there was anything to be scraped
off it."
</p><p>  She was right, for presently afterwards that oddest of all odd figures,
Downy, was seen approaching, riding upon his jackass.  It being terribly
warm, he was fanning himself with his hat, an odd shaped thing, something like the three cornered cocked hat of the last century; a feather
stuck out horizontally from each point, and the sides were richly ornamented with gold studs; his head was quite bald, for he had removed his
celebrated blue wig, which now dangled down, the pink tail being tied
to one of the large gilt buttons of his coat.  He soon related the cause
of his flight, for which he got heartily laughed at, and the woman exclaimed, " Why, Downy, you are a greater coward than you are a rogue,
and that's saying something.  Why, man, it was not for you the search
was made, but better birds; but they moulted their plumage, and the
hawks were all at fault."
 </p><p> Diddle 'em  Downy did not exactly understand the meaning of her
words, but felt that he had not only disgraced his name by being done,
but had by his precipitate retreat lost a good day's engagement.  It was
too late now to grumble, and he was ashamed to go back, so letting his
lovely steed loose, he sat down and partook plentifully of the refreshments
offered. They conversed for a time most affably upon the chances of
success at the coming Uxbridge fair; and the woman, having plied
Diddle 'em Downy plentifully with strong drinks, tried all her power of
fascination and persuasion, to tempt him to break his engagement
with their rival, with whom he was to perform at Uxbridge; but Downy
for reasons best known to himself, and really to his own absolute
astonishment, proved honest, and positively refused every o r the
woman tendered, who, upon finding she could not make it worth her
while, thought it useless to throw away her breath, so was henceforth
silent.
 </p><p> Diddle'em having got all he wanted, shut his eyes, and became as
silent as herself; thus the three sat for some time, each absorbed by
their own peculiar thoughts.
 </p><p> The sun had now descended below the horizon-the western sky was
begining to doff its splendid livery of red and gold, and assume a far more
modest, but scarcely less lovely gear of grayish blue, studded with stars
of silver. At every step the glorious sun proceeded in his god-like march
to drive night round the world, and shower his daily blessings on far
distant climes; the timid moon came bolder forth, and then like a weak,
but presumptuous queen, usurped for a brief space the throne of night.
The last sounds of the feathered choir's evening hymn had died away;
the little choristers had sought their leafy homes, and all around was
still. At last the old man and his daughter, seeing that Downy had
fallen fast asleep, and not caring for him further, arose and left him where
he lay, and retired into the van.
</p><p>  It was sometime before Downy awoke; when he did, he turned himself over on his hands and knees, and then began to get up, somewhat

<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>

after the fashion of a cat, that is, he first bent his back into the segment
of an arch. When he did get upon his legs, he shook himself once or
twice, to call up the energies of his gigantic mind, then perceiving that
his friends had deserted him, he determined to take advantage of
the cool of the night, and the bright light of the harvest moon, to pursue
his journey towards the next fair, which was to be at Uxbridge.
 </p><p> Amongst that class of persons there was no need of much ceremony,
so without disturbing any one to bid them adieu, he caught his donkey,
fastened the saddle upon its back, and then wrapping up his wig very
carefully-for that wig he regarded as his greatest treasure-he tied a
dirty kerchief over his head, and mounting his dapple steed, started at a
moderate pace towards Uxbridge.
</p><p>  He had not been gone long before the woman, coming from the van, said,
as she descended the steps-" Father, keep a look out till I return; I grow
more anxious every minute. I'll walk and meet him-the Clipper's
not the punctual chap he used to be; he's either got drunk, or there's more
mischief in the wind." Having said this she sauntered along towards
London, muttering all the way she went.
 </p><p> As her form vanished in the imperfect light of the moon, the girl crept
from her tent, and having anxiously watched the woman's departure,
approached the van, and ascending to the door, knocked gently, and
whispered, "Grandfather, mother's gone."  The door opened, and the
old man appearing, said half kindly, half pettishly, " Child, child, you'll
get me into sad trouble one of these days.'
 </p><p> " Oh, Grandfather," replied the girl, " you are the only being on earth
now, who is kind to me; and I am so hungry, mother has not given me
a morsel to-day."
 </p><p> " Your mother says," replied the old man, " that if she overfeeds you
she shall make you fat, and spoil your beauty."
 </p><p> " I often pray to heaven that I could myself spoil what you call my
beauty, for then I think mother would turn me adrift, and-and-but
I have my own thoughts what I would do then."
  The old man not having attended to the latter part of the girl's words,
he having turned into the caravan, made no remark upon what she had said,
but bringing out some little dainty bits he had really kept aside purposely
for her, unknown to any one, he said, smiling and kissing her with real
kindness, " There, child, you see I had not forgotten you; come up and
sit on the top step, and then we shall see more easily when your mother
is returning."
 </p><p> The girl did not require to be told twice, so running up the steps and
sitting down beside the old man, for a moment forgot all her troubles and
seemed quite happy.
 </p><p> The old man watched the child with great attention, and sighing, said
to himself, " Poor thing, were I not so old, so feeble, so dependent, you
should not want a friend to save you; but were I to-- they would
murder me-no, no."
 </p><p> The girl having very speedily finished her meal, looked up in the old
man's face with anxiety, and said, " Why are you so serious, grandfather?
you are seldom thus when we are alone."
 </p><p> The old man, arousing himself from his thoughtful mood, replied, " Oh,








                          <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

child, I fear there's plenty of cause for our all being serious-doyou know
what has happened ?"
 </p><p> " All I know," said the girl, " is, that to-day just as I was being
  shown dressed in all my finery, as Venus, there was a frightful screaming
  in our booth, and such a confusion created, that the curtain was closed,
  and every one was running about in alarm. Presently, mother came
  hurrying up to me; she was biting her lips and looking as white as ashes,
  and taking hold of my clothes began to pull them off; she told Sarah,
the tight rope girl, to put them on; and then she herself changed dresses
with Slopsy Sal; and Ray, the Clipper, too, was at the same time
   slipping off his beautiful green and gold dress, in which he thinks he
   looks so fine, and as mother dragged me out the backway, I saw him
   putting the green and gold on ugly Tom. We hurried away on our road
here, and that's all I know about it, grandfather-but there must be
   something wrong."
  </p><p>   " There has been very little right, child, since the night you were
 brought to us. You have forgotten that time, I suppose ?"
  </p><p>   " No, no, no !" said the girl, beginning to cry bitterly, ' I shall never,
   never, forget it. And oh, mother did beat me so, the other day; she beat
   me till she thought she had killed me, only because as we were coming
 from Rochester, I peeped from the window of the van, to try and see the
 house in which, when I was a very little child, I was so happy. Oh,
 grandfather, how cruel it was of that fine lady on the Bridge to turn
 me away, when she found her own child. She always told me I was her
  own, and I loved her as my life, and she used to say she loved me; and
then there was the gentleman I called my father, I loved him too; and
then there was Edward-oh, I shall die, grandfather, I shall die if I
   think of it."
  </p><p>   The poor girl cast her head in despair upon the bosom of the old man,
and wept as though her young heart were bursting. The old man wept too,
   and was working himself up to have courage to tell the child all he knew,
   when he sawhis daughter returning. A word was enough to stop the child's
   tears, as if by a spell, and make her fly to her retreat beneath the shed,
   or rather the old covering of a tilt cart, that formed her tent, the old man
 at the same time retiring with equal precipitation into the van.
 </p><p>    The woman came on in no very good humour; she mumbled, and
  grumbled, and growled, and then approached the girl's tent, into which she
  peeped; but the child was so far schooled in dissimulation, that the
  sleep she feigned quite satisfied the woman that she was safe and at rest.
  Presently she heard a sort of ploughman's whistle in the distance, and
  soon afterwards a countryman came jogging along the road; of him she
  asked if, as he had come that way, he had seen a man answering
  the description she gave him.
  </p><p>   "What shou'd I want to see a mon for ?" said the countryman; "I
   seed no mon, not holy !" and again beginning to whistle a rustic air, he
   moved on. He had scarcely gone a dozen paces, ere he turned round,
   and bursting into a loud laugh, called out, " What, Nan, girl-not know
   your Clipper ?-then I must be well disguised, i'faith."
   </p><p>  "Is it really you, Ray ?" said the woman; " but I'd swear it was by that
   laugh.  I think you would joke if you were going to be hanged, as old Sir

  Thomas More did when he had his head cut off-but why this disguise ?"
  </p><p>  " Why ? I should think you could guess. It wasn't likely I should
 wish to be recognised by young Osborne as one of his dear friends of the
 marsh, was it ?"
   </p><p> Just as he had uttered these words, a very slight portion of the
 woolen covering of the gipsy tent, under which the girl lay, was slowly
 raised, the part was in the shade, but still something might be dimly
 perceived-the shadow of a face. It was the girl endeavouring to catch
 the words they spoke.
  </p><p>  " There are not many out of our clan," replied the woman, " you
 would like to be recognised by. But tell me how matters have sped since
 the morning-it was my anxiety about that which has kept me up here
 half the night."
  </p><p> " Well, then, Nan, sit down here, and I can rest my back against this
 trunk of a tree ; for I've that to tell you that will take a little time."
   Between the spot where they then stood and the girl's tent, lay the
 trunk of a large tree; they both sat down upon the ground, and resting
 against it, were now very close to the spot whence the child was watching;
 their backs being turned towards her, she listened in comparative safety.
 She had caught the name of Osborne, and her heart was throbbing with
 the thoughts of days now gone; every succeeding word they uttered,
 created in her breast an interest more and more intense.
  </p><p> "Well, you know," said Ray, "you were, as you always are, right
 to a tittle.  You should have been a queen, Nan, for damn me, if any
 rascally ministers, or bamboozling ambassadors, would have thrown dust
 in your eyes."
   </p><p>" Pshaw !" said the woman, in a tone of contempt, " go on !"
  </p><p> "Not an hour, not half an hour elapsed, before, sure enough, all the
Hewets were upon us, armed to the teeth with law and mighty authority,
as they thought it. I am not one to trust to others' eyes, so had popped
on this innocent disguise, that if they did come, as you said they would,
I might look 'em boldly in the face, and see myself which way the cat
might jump.  Talking of jumping, you should have seen Downy jump
off the stage, when he saw the officers-but of that anon. In came
Master Hewet and Osborne, and their principal witness, as they thought
her, that minx Flora Gray. I've marked her, for her share in the
business, I can tell her. Oh, you would have split your sides, had you
seen the falling of their chops, when bandy-legged Sarah, the rope girl,
stood forth as Venus. Oh, it was a glorious hit of yours; but I must
own I did not feel very much flattered, when Osborne actually, as he
looked at ugly Tom, in my green and gold, seemed to have great doubts
whether that ugly rascal was not myself. Flora was the only one not easily
to be done; with half an eye she saw that Slopsy Sal was not my beautiful
Nan; and the go wouldn't have ended as it did, had not all our troop,
man, woman, and child, sworn her out of countenance: for better safety,
I ordered the show to be struck at once-it will be here soon But,
Nan, although what is past may be a joke, what's to come may not be one.
I have seen him to-day, that I would I had never seen. I have seen
your husband."
</p><p>  "Spikely !" exclaimed the woman, in a whisper so low that the child







                                           <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>

lost the sound, for she was really Beltham Spikely's wife; " did he see
you ?" she said in a louder tone.
 </p><p> " No, and I hope he never may; the brute's like the dog in the
manger; he won't love you himself, and he won't let any one else do so
for him. It's my belief that if he did not so thoroughly hate Hewet
himself, and could fix the stealing of the child entirely on your shoulders,
without confessing his own share as the planner of the scheme, he'd blow
the whole affair to revenge himself on you. They tell me it was the
child's real mother who screamed out so lustily, and had nearly ruined
us all, but they believe her mad, so it may blow over, and we hear no
more about it."
 </p><p> "We must have been mad ourselves, I think," said the woman, "to
have gone so near the lion's den; but who would have guessed that
after so long a time, and under such circumstances, the girl Anne Hewet
could have been recognised-a mother's eyes alone could have had the
sharpness to penetrate such a blinding mist as we had thrown around her:
but we must show her no more; her beauty must be turned to a different
account; my uncle, the smuggler from Antwerp, is in the river; he shall
take her abroad; she'll be worth her weight in gold there, and we be
safer by her absence."
 </p><p> The distant jingling of bells was now heard, which put a stop to the
discourse. Spikely's wife and her admirer rose, and looking in the
direction whence the sound proceeded, saw, creeping slowly towards
them the carts and vans containing the remainder of the troop and all
their worldly treasures.
 </p><p> The first van was drawn by two old horses, whose noses hung down
so near to the ground, that they seemed as if looking for something they
had lost the last time they had been that way; around their necks were
hung a few cracked bells, no doubt to keep the poor old things awake.
This was the van in which Anne Hewet had been so unmercifully beaten
for endeavouring to look once more upon her former happy home. The man
who walked at the side, with a large carter's whip over his shoulder, seemed
almost as much asleep as the horses. This man was Ugly Tom, and
ugly enough he certainly did look, now he had moulted the green and
gold, and the beautiful plume of feathers. Behind him came a waggon
containing all the poles, platforms and ropes, and enormous bundles of
canvass, with which they constructed the principal building of their show.
On the top of this sat Slopsy Sal, with her lovely family of six children,
the oldest not being more than five years of age, seemed to indicate that
four of them, in all probability, formed two pair of twins.  There was
no necessity to have bells to keep the horses of this waggon awake, for
the unceasing crying of the children answered the purpose admirably.
This waggon was conducted by one of the most miserable looking creatures
ever seen-he did nothing but groan and sigh, and moan, and we might
almost say weep. Now, who could this melancholy man be ? Who ? why,
Master Merriman, the clown ! When the poor fellow's spirits had sunk
quite down into his boots, the only way he could shake them up again,
was by a little " ground and lofty tumbling;" so whenever he found the
tears coming into his eyes, he flung his heels up into the air, and walked
alongside the waggon on his hands; this always had the effect of throwing








<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>                       .

his blood into such a charming glow, that he could be quite funny for
at least ten minutes afterwards. The last vehicle was the one more
richly laden than any, for in it was deposited the whole splendid ward
robe of the company, including the green and gold; but there were
greater treasures in that four-wheeled cart than mere outward finery,
for here reposed the beauties of the troop, the three graces, and Sarah,
the bandy-legged tight rope dancer: there was one rather odd passenger
in this cart, which, in a small degree, destroyed the elegance of the party,
this passenger was a little donkey of about five weeks old; the fact
was, this little donkey could not be trusted in the road, for it was always
getting under the wheels, because it would not let its mother, a fine fat
old jenny ass in the shafts, alone.
 </p><p> By the side, to use a modern technicality, walked the " walking
gentleman" of the company; he was a youth, who would doubtless have
been very handsome, but having fallen flat on his face when a baby, he
now appeared to have no nose at all; his profile could therefore, not be
regarded as quite perfect. This youth was about sixteen years of age,
and about two yards and a quarter in length; he was the son of a
deceased giant, but so miserably thin, that he went by the name of
" Walking-stick."  In their little ballets he always played the lover,
and he was now playing it in earnest to Sarah. Sarah had just become
wonderfully sentimental, and was whispering to her heart the very words
that Shakspere afterwards wrote, and took the credit for-she was just
saying in her thoughts, that she " wished Heaven had made her such a
man"-when, Master Merriman, who had been walking upon his hands
further than usual, and was, thereby, thrown into unusually high spirits,
destroyed all the romance, by calling out facetiously to her lover, " I
say, Walking-stick, just lend me yourself to beat my horses with, for I
have no whip."
</p><p>  Young Walking-stick would have turned his nose up at him, but for
the accident we have before mentioned, so as he could not do that, instead of lending the clown himself, he was about to lend him a kick
par derriere, but downy was too much accustomed to practical jokes to
be taken off his guard, so tossing his hand up behind him, he caught the
heel of the young giant, who immediately found himself flat on his back.
 </p><p> Sarah screamed of course, and the graces said it was a disgrace; then
Sarah protested that "if her lover did love her, he should shew his love
by coining into the cart, for if he took the little donkey on his lap, there
mould be plenty of room ;" this being done, and the clown sinking into
his usual melancholy, they trudged on quietly enough, until they came
to where they found their mistress and her admirer awaiting them.
 </p><p> Instead of pitching their tents for the night where they then were, it was
thought advisable, in consequence of information brought by Ugly Tom,
that they should, as speedily as possible, move as far as they could from
the vicinity of London. All was now bustle and preparation for the continuance of their midnight journey. Young Walking-stick's legs being
the longest in the company, he was sent off in quest of the blind mare;
Master Merriman was employed in harnessing the mule that was to drag
the tilt cart; and while this was doing, the remainder of the troop alighted
for a while, just to stretch their limbs and take a sup.







                                           <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>

   The old blind mare being found, and attached to the sleeping van-
 all was ready, except the top being put to the cart.
  </p><p> " Come, Venus, jump up," said Ugly Tom, giving the tent a kick
with his foot to wake her, " get up, or you'll perhaps have your beauty
spoilt, by getting one of the ribs of the tilt stuck in your eye."
  </p><p> " And serve her right too," said one of the graces, who always thought
 she herself ought to have been the Venus. " If you stuck 'em in both
 her eyes it would be no great matter, for they are not much to boast of-
 they're not bigger than peas." Now the young lady who spoke, no
 doubt preferred eyes a little larger, her own being some trifle smaller than
 decent sized lemons-rather of their tint, too, and certainly looking quite
 as sour.
 </p><p>  " Up with it," said Ray the Clipper, to the men who were holding
the tilt ready to lift it, the moment the girl was from underneath, " up
with it, and if she will keep her eyes shut, damn me, but I'll open 'em
with a cut or two of this whip!" As he said these words he snatched
the carter's whip from Ugly Tom. The men lifted the tilt, when to
their utter amazement they found the girl was gone!
 </p><p>  "What," exclaimed Nan, "gone, impossible !- I saw her lying
there not an hour ago, sound asleep. Anne ! Anne !" she called out,
" hither instantly, or I'll flay you alive, if you come any of your tricks
on me."
 </p><p> They all listened, but no sound fell upon their expectant ears. Now
a general hunt began, for they thought she must be close at hand-
but nowhere could they find her. Wider and wider became the circuit
of their search. The moon's last rays had faded as the bright lamp of
night sank majestically beneath the horizon.
  </p><p>Spikeley's wife became more and more alarmed, for as the darkness
increased, their powers to discover the lost one diminished; every lantern
they could muster was brought into use, and strange indeed was the
effect these flickering lights produced, as they were seen far and near,
dancing about, as it were, like goblin spirits of the heath. Every tree and
bush was examined, but all to no purpose. One by one they all returned
with the same announcement of ill-success; the last who came in was
the old man; he trembled from head to foot, and pale was his visage as
he told them a rambling story about his having, he was sure, seen a ghost
-he said, "he had strayed on and on, until he found himself standing
exactly in the centre of the three-sided gallows at Tybourne Tree-it
was there, while he stood trembling at the thoughts of the unhallowed
spot he stood in, that he had seen a figure flit by, and vanish into the
road that led to Edgware."
 </p><p> " Fool !" exclaimed his daughter, " you should have told us that at
once-ghost indeed, it was the girl herself. Ray, mount and after her !
if she escapes-but you know her value."
 </p><p> The Clipper and Ugly Tom took the two best horses of their stud,
and mounting them, hurried away as fast as such steeds could carry them,
diagonally across the country, so that by coming out some way up the
Edgware-road, they might cut off her escape. No great kindness was
avinced by either of the equestrians towards their poor beasts-no blow
was hard enough-no oath was bad enough to be bestowed upon them.







<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>                     .

After having split their hedge-sticks into shreds by beating the poor
animals, and exhausting every oath their tongues could utter, they at
last found themselves in the main way, or road; here they halted, when
having taken a little breath, and allowed their panting steeds to do the
like, they placed themselves on either side of the road, and then slowly
and as quietly as they could, they crept along towards Tybourne, expecting every moment to meet the surprised and affrighted fugitive.
Wherever they came to a bush or tree, they invariably passed behind it,
in case the runaway might take alarm at the sound of their horses' feet,
and hide herself till they had passed.
  </p><p> Careful as they were not to leave a chance neglected, still they proved
unsuccessful; at one time they believed they had found the treasure
they sought; they fancied they saw a female form approaching them;
they placed themselves in the deepest shade, then pouncing upon the
comer, frightened her into fits, for she thought them thieves, upon which
they discovered her to be a poor old woman hurrying to the nearest village
for a doctor to attend her dying daughter. Not a few oaths fell from off
their tongues as they bade her go on her way. When they had come
down the road as far as Tybourne Tree they again halted, uncertain
what to do, neither of them liking to face the tigress, Nan, now they had
proved unsuccessful.-" I wish the fiends had swallowed the girl," said
Ray, savagely, " before she had found her way among us: I was ever
against it."
 </p><p> "Against what ?" enquired ugly Tom; "there's always been some
mystery hanging about that girl, that makes one more than half suspect
she's not Nan's child at all. Come Ray, speak out; isn't she the merchant's daughter? you can surely trust Tom  Blink-the-gulls, or the
devil's in it. Come, tell us who, and what she is ?"
 </p><p> "Ask Nan yourself," replied the Clipper, who, we may here mention,
gained that honourable title in consequence of his wonderful dexterity at
clipping the strings by which the pouches, or pendant pockets were hung
at people's sides; the more common name was " cut-purse ;" from this
distinguished stock has descended our modern pickpockets.  "Ask Nan
yourself, an' you dare !"
  </p><p>" Yes !" said the other, " and be answered by her teeth instead of her
tongue.  Not I, i'faith."
 </p><p> They stood beneath the tree for a few minutes, and looked around as
far as the darkness of the night or rather morning would allow, and
then, with reluctant steps, made their way to their companions.
 </p><p> Nan and the Clipper went some distance from  the rest, and argued
the best course to pursue.  As the girl knew their intention to visit
Uxbridge Fair, it was settled, that they should immediately alter their
rout, and push on to St. Albans in the way to Dunstable, and so on
by short journeys, exhibiting a day here, and a day there, fill up
the time until the great fair at Bedford. The instant the plan was
determined upon, the whole camp, as it might be called, broke up,
and forming the line, began to retrace their way to Tybourne Tree,
round which they passed, and turning sharply to the left, entered
the Edgware Road, where we will now leave them to pursue their
weary way.</p>

EXACTLY at the time we are writing of, there were two men, the one
in London, the other in Westminster, whose minds were equally torn to
shreds by perplexities and doubts, as to what would be the best, that is
the most agreeable, manner in which they should each employ his future
life; both were now their own masters; both had the world before them;
both had a peculiar love for self-the one was King Henry the Eighth,
the other the Saintly Father Brassinjaw.
 </p><p> Henry was at this time confined to his palace by growing infirmities,
occasioned by an unconquerable ulcerous disease, which gave him ample
time, but not much temper, for reflection.  Brassinjaw, in like manner,
had equal time, and quite as little temper, for reflection, by being confined
in the cage on London Bridge. This cage was a sort of sentry-box-
shaped building, near one of the archways on the Bridge, close to an
opening that looked upon the water; by it stood the stocks-there was
no door to the cage, but a large cross of wood stood in the way. The
cage being elevated upon several stone steps, the passers-by had a good
view of the prisoners within, and the prisoners within had a good bantering from the people without.
  </p><p>Henry, who was now so corpulent, that obesity became quite a fashion,
was reclining upon a low couch, supported by cushions of amber satin,
listening to his favourite, Cromwell, as he descanted upon two of the
most pleasing subjects that ever fell upon the ear of Henry the Eighth-
MONEY and MARRIAGE.
 </p><p> With respect to the first of these, he was relating with what success
his two commissioners, Spikely and Horton, had assisted in despoiling
the shrine of Thomas a Becket at Canterbury; two immense coffers
had been filled with gold and jewels, each of them so heavy that it took
no less than eight strong men to lift.
 </p><p> It is notorious that Henry was a great stickler for the forms of law,
so before he would have the name of Thomas a Becket degraded from
the list of Saints, the great lawyers of the day were compelled to enact
the childish farce of citing a Becket, who had been dead some four
hundred years, to appear in court, and answer to the charges contained
in a criminal information that had been filed against him  Having
waited with due solemnity for thirty days, to allow the poor Saint time
to travel from wherever he might happen to be, and he not then appearing, sentence was pronounced, that Thomas a Becket was guilty of
"rebellion, treason, and contumacy," and all the riches of his shrine
were seized by the crown, as being the personal property of the traitor.
 </p><p> Is it possible that such men as Cromwell and Cranmer, and others
with minds as great, and holding stations almost as high, could have
ever become so degraded as to take part in such proceedings; but all men
           21







<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>                    .

had, from fear of the gibbet and the flame, so habituated themselves to
follow the will of the tyrant, that they were little better than puppets, to
be set in motion by the movement of his finger.
 </p><p> The King chuckled again, as he thought of the treasure the two coffers
from Canterbury would place at his immediate command; and when
Cromwell drew forth a list of suppressed Abbeys, and other religious
houses, and stated in detail that no less than six hundred and forty
four convents, ninety colleges, two thousand three hundred and seventy
four chantries and free chapels, with one hundred and ten hospitals,
were now annexed to the crown, his delight knew no bounds.  It was
at this moment the King first dropped a hint to Cromwell, that he saw
no reason why, one day or other, his trusty and well-beloved Privy-seal
should not become the Earl of Essex.
 </p><p> The King had now been a widower for nearly two years, Queen Jane
having died twelve days after the birth of her son Edward, in October
<date value="1537">1537</date>. It had not been his own fault, that he had thus long remained
single, but the difficulty was to fix upon a judicious choice. Ever since the
death of Jane, the Protestant party had been decidedly losing ground.
 </p><p> Bishop Gardiner, the fiery bishop as he was called, had wheedled
himself into the good graces of the King; it was he, with the King's
Highness, it is believed, who drew up the celebrated "Six articles," or
bloody statute, as it was commonly denominated.
 </p><p>  Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, was the most zealous of all the Papists, and consequently the sworn enemy of Cromwell. Both were equally
deep, both equally unscrupulous, as to the means employed to render
their party triumphant.  Each knowing how great was the influence a
wife ever possessed over their master, as long as he liked her, they were
both anxious that he should again marry; the one sought for a Roman
Catholic Princess, the other a Princess of the reformed religion; and it
was to this subject, of vital importance to himself, that Cromwell now
led the conversation.
 </p><p> It appears that very soon after the death of Queen Jane, the King
proposed to the Duchess Dowager of Milan, who replied, " that if she
had two heads she might think of the match; but that as she had but
one, she would rather decline the honour."
 </p><p>  The Princess Mary of Guise was then thought of, but she was already
engaged to the King of Scots. Henry then begged of the French King
to bring the two sisters of Mary of Guise to Calais, that he might there,
as if at a market, choose which he liked best; but this, French gallantry
forbade, so the French King very properly declined. Cromwell had artfully led the King on to absolute despair, in not being able to find a
Princess in every way worthy of receiving so great a blessing as himself;
for a husband; he then told the King that he had just received the miniature of one of the greatest beauties in the world, the lovely Ann of
Cleves, sister of the reigning Duke of Cleves, a Protestant, and that her
"education, sobriety, and morals were excellent."  Then drawing forth
the miniature, by Lucas, the court painter of Cleves, he presented it to
the enraptured eyes of his Grace.
 </p><p> Henry could always fall in love in five minutes, if he wished to do so,
and feeling that way inclined at this moment, he at once looked upon the








                                           <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

fair face of Anne, as that of his future wife. Although, at this time no
great beauty himself, he was determined to have beauty in her whom he
married, so to be perfectly secure upon this point, it was settled, that Hans
Holbein should start immediately to the court of the Duke of Cleves,
and return with a correct portrait of the beautiful Anne.
 </p><p> Cromwell hugged himself at the success of his new scheme, for Anne
being sister to one of the Princes of the Protestant confederacy, he believed
by this match he should place the star of his own destiny so high in
the ascendant, that no cloud the opposing party could send forth, would
ever again be able to dim it.  How poor, how weak and uncertain,
are all the schemes built up by man! This, as he thought, well-laid plan-
this, apparently sure haven for all his hopes, proved to be the rocky strand
upon which his whole venture was wrecked and lost, for when the King
saw Anne of Cleves, which he did in secret, he being disguised, she was
so unlike the portraits he had received, that he at once took such a
loathing to her, that it is said, he had nearly fallen from sickness.
Cromwell, as may be supposed, received the whole weight of his indignation: the favourite attempted to excuse the act, by reminding Henry
that he had himself desired his minister to find him a " fine large woman."
"Yes," said the King, " a fine large woman, but I did not tell you to
bring me a Flanders mare."
 </p><p> We will now return to Father Brassinjaw, who still enjoyed the agreeable distinction of being laughed at by hundreds who passed and re-passed,
as going to or from the fair.  Brassinjaw turned his back upon the scoffers,
and leaning his back against the cross-post at the doorway, ruminated
seriously upon his future prospects.  It appeared that poor Brassinjaw
had been degraded from his office in the chapel upon the Bridge, for
having been discovered picking out the real diamond eyes from one of
the images; and then, in his anguish, having uttered some rather offensive
expressions against the most religious Henry, he had been surprised to
discover himself suddenly left for hours in the public cage.
  </p><p> " Once a priest, always a priest," said he to himself; " but of what use
is it, if we can no longer get anything by it ?  I've a great mind to be
revenged by changing my creed altogether; but what creed shall I take
to? that's a ticklish question." He first thought of the ANABAPTISTS,
who, at that time, besides their peculiar theological dogmas, acknowledged no judge or magistrate, no submission to civil law, no right of war,
or of capital punishment, except in so far as they were moved individually
by what they interpreted to be inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
  </p><p> "There are many points in this," he observed, " that would suit me
well. I like the idea of ' no submission to civil law'-that's good-very
good ! ' No capital punishment,' that's still better ; but-but-but-"
having said but two or three times, he turned his mind upon the " MEN OF
THE FAMILY OF LOVE," or Davidians, as they were called, from David
George, who sometimes represented himself as Christ, and sometimes as
the Holy Ghost. "Why shouldn't I become one of 'the Family ot
Love ?' I might then wear a silk liripoop, or any other sort of liripoop I
chose, and might let my hair grow as long as I pleased, and use a dagger
too if I liked."
  </p><p> The long hair, the dagger, and the liripoop, or hood of silk, were three







<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>                  .

things the Pope, in consequence of the growing dandyism of the English
priesthood, had found it necessary to forbid. "But-but-but-" he
continued, and having again said but several times, the PREDESTINARIANS came under his examination; these he rather liked, for they
affirmed that ' the elect could NOT sin, nor the regenerate fallfrom grace.'
Next he thought of the ARIANS, then the UNITARIANS; but of these he
seemed to think but very lightly: not so the next, THE LIBERTINES;
this sect caused him to hesitate for some time, and perhaps he might
have become a Libertine, but for the ANTINOMIANS, who maintained,
both by their teaching and their practice, that the ' chosen were at liberty
to help themselves to whatever food, raiment, goods, and chattels their necessities required; and no sin or abomination of the outward man was
of any significance, provided only that they sinned not in the inner man."
This appeared to Father Brassinjaw so comfortable, so charitable a creed
towards its own followers, that he had all but made up his mind, when
he was suddenly caused to turn round, by hearing a large bell ringing at
no great distance, and a man's voice exclaiming, "  yes ! 0 yes! 0 yes !"
It was one of the criers, or walking advertisers, who came to announce
that the late landlord of the Cardinal's Hat, there upon the Bridge,
having been hanged, the whole concern, including the goodwill of that
" highly respectable house," was to be sold " by the candle."
 </p><p>  The selling by the candle was an old style of auction, which is, we
believe, in some few places occasionally employed to this day.  The
method pursued was this: A piece of candle, about an inch, was lighted
when the sale began, and he whose bidding was the last before the
candle expired, was declared the purchaser.
 </p><p>  The moment Brassinjaw heard the announcement about the candle,
a sudden light broke in upon him. He remembered the happy hours he
had passed in that delightful spot; how happy then would the man be
who could call that spot his own! His mind became suddenly fixed.
" The prophecy," he exclaimed, "the prophecy shall be fulfilled ! It
was always foretold that one day I should possess a Cardinal's Hat, and
now, cost what it will, that Cardinal's Hat shall cover this virtuous
head; it shall be mine.  Yes," he continued in a tone of great determination, " yes, I will relinquish the SPIRITUAL, for a SPIRITUOUS calling.
I will become a publican and -- " he was just going to add " sinner,"
but seeming to feel that that would be understood without expressing it,
he said no more.
 </p><p> When the time came which was to permit of his being allowed to
descend from his unenviable exaltation, the two halberdiers, who acted as
a guard of dishonour, quietly marched away, and left him to do just as
he liked, either to remain or go; there being no door, Father Brassinjaw
crept from beneath the cross-beam before mentioned, and at once hurried
towards the Cardinal's Hat, to examine more minutely into his intended
purchase.
 </p><p> Not a nook or corner did he leave unexamined. There were some odd
things connected with this house, which, to any but one who had had
such a thorough schooling in the mysteries of deception, and underhand
proceedings as Father Brassinjaw, might have been overlooked, or passed
by heedlessly.  There was not a single room, in the partitions of which



<figure id="fig.00011" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.030.DO01.00011"><head>Father Brassinjaw in the Cage.</head> </figure>




                                           <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

there were not holes, through which those in the next apartment might
easily witness all that passed.
 </p><p> Brassinjaw, observing this, began to feel already quite at home, so
being alone at the time, he commenced examining every panel of the
wainscot, and sure enough, exactly as he began to guess would be the
case, so it proved, for more than one were made to slip aside, and leave
an opening large enough for a man to pass, and thus secretly enter, room
after room, all over the dwelling. Observing a trap-door near one of the
tables, indeed exactly under the seat upon which he himself had generally
sat, he took hold of the ring, and raising it, had nearly tumbled head
long through, from alarm, at finding it opened over the waters, which
were at that moment dashing madly down the falls beneath the Bridge.
Having steadied his nerves, he examined the trap-door, to see whether
it was strong enough to be left over such a dangerous outlet; in doing
this, he became quite surprised to find the hinges constructed in a manner,
that would allow them to bend equally well both ways, so that, but for
a couple of iron bolts protruding from the opposite side of the opening,
the trap would, when lowered, fall towards the roaring waters.  Upon
further examination, he discovered that these bolts too, were moveable,
and could be pushed back, although they were held forward by a
spring. He shut down the trap, and began to reflect upon the probable
use to which such a door might be put ; here his ecclesiastical education
was of use to him, and brought to his mind the strange resemblance
between this trap and the oubliettes of the Spanish Inquisition.
Having once caught the idea, he began to think that if these bolts were
made to move, there was, doubtless, some method by which their movement might be accomplished, without going beneath, and forcing them
back with the hand, a thing, considering their position, almost impossible to be done.  In looking along the floor in the direction the bolts lay,
and observing a portion of the boards rotten and rather broken away, he
stooped down, and endeavouring to make the small opening larger by
breaking away more of the rotten part, in giving a tolerably hard pull
at it, the whole plank came up, and there he discovered two ropes attached to the bolts, which, passing along beneath the floor, entered the
adjoining room. He carefully replaced the board, and going into the
next apartment, found an empty cupboard, at the bottom of which were
two round apertures, evidently through which the ropes had at one time
passed. In the back of this cupboard he also perceived chinks and holes,
so disposed, that a person shut in the cupboard could observe everything
that passed in the other room.
 </p><p> All these discoveries, far from alarming Brassinjaw, or making him
shudder at the thought of what dreadful scenes might perhaps have
taken place there, rather whetted his appetite for the acquisition of such
a strange abode. Other parties now appearing, Father Brassinjaw left
the Cardinal's Hat, more determined than ever to become its sure
possessor.
</p><p>  Having once made up his mind to revolutionize his mode of living, he
thought the first thing to be done was to change his outward man: this,
by the by, is a very common course; many a rogue believes himself
reformed, when he puts on the covering of honesty, forgetting that, unless








<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>                   .

the cancer of a vicious heart be thoroughly rooted out, the fruit that
heart brings forth will still be rotten at the core, however disguised in
outward form.
  </p><p>" First, I'll to the botcher," said Brassinjaw; "my present habiliments are but ill suited to the tapster's trade, though his and mine are
not so widely differing as silly people think; the business of both of us
is to intoxicate the mind, and make men fools." The more he worked
up his own mind to the change he intended to make, the more did he
try to believe that his new calling was the honester of the two; and
certainly as he, and, alas! thousands of others, had exercised his
miscalled holy power, perhaps, the publican would prove the lesser
sinner.
 </p><p> As Master Thomas Stow, of Aldgate, was a tailor of no mean repute,
our saintly father hied him thither, where, as Horton had formerly done,
he found the old man, spectacles on nose, his boy beside him, both hard
at work; and, as before, the elder Stow was soundly scolding the younger,
for thinking more of old musty tomes, than he ever did of jackets, jerkins,
slops, or hose.
 </p><p> The cause of Horton's visit had not more surprised the old tailor, than
did the announcement made by Brassinjaw, that he "lacked a comely
suit of newest cut," and, odd enough for an intended publican, he desired
it might be made "of some right sober colour"-we fear it would be
the only part about him that would remain sober, if once he took possession of the Cardinal's Hat.
 </p><p> The old tailor took off his spectacles, wiped them, and then put them
on again, and looking full in the face of Brassinjaw, he exclaimed with
surprise, " Why, holy father, I should have as much expected to have
seen Saint Thomas a Becket himself, rest his holy bones, walk in upon
such an errand, as Father Brassinjaw."
 </p><p> " And I should have as soon expected," replied Brassinjaw, "to have
seen so wise a tailor, as Master Stow is known to be, swallow his own
goose to cure an indigestion, as to have heard him call that rascally
rebel, a Becket, a saint! ,Why, know you not, man, that our most
religious King, the gentle-hearted Henry-" here Brassinjaw frowning
mumbled something to himself, which was no doubt an eulogistic expression, far too flattering to His Grace the King, to be uttered aloud-
Yes, the King in his great wisdom, has found out, what any other fool
-I mean any fool, might have done for the last four hundred years, that a
Becket was but a counterfeit Saint, otherwise, why didn't he, the other day,
fiace the lawyers, and answer for himself like a man; but no, he let the
action go by default, for he knew he could not deceive King Henry, though
he might all the world beside. And now, Master Stow, know that if you
would keep your ears to yourself, you had better keep your tongue so
too, and never call at Becket saint again."
  </p><p>" I never thought him one !" exclaimed the old tailor, falling in a
moment into the humour of the times, which made men call black white,
one day, and white black the next; this habit, brought on by fear, extended from the highest to the lowest in the land; " I never thought
him one, and it always went against my stomach, as I let the lie slip
off my tongue when I said he was. But now, Father Brassinjaw--  "








                                            <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>

 "Father! father me no more !" said Brassinjaw: 'when I put on
 thy new doublet, I put off the old priest. So father me no more; I am
 now no father, though perhaps I may be soon."
 " But, prithee, what in the name of the saints has wrought this
 wonderous change in thee ?" enquired the old tailor.
  </p><p> " The times, man, the times! the badness of the times!" replied
 Brassinjaw, sticking out his two arms quite straight, until he looked like
 a fat letter T.
  </p><p> As the old tailor began to measure him, he continued-" All trades,
 Master Stow, have their ups and downs; no firm ever lasted for ever,
 howsoever carefully, cleverly, deeply, it might have been conducted-
 let the sleeves be large and puffed-perhaps we, of our craft, ought not
 to complain, for we carried on a roaring trade for some hundreds of years,
 and he who has left off bankrupt now the market's stopped, has but himself to blame-there was no lack of pickings, Master Stow, there was no
 lack of pickings-let my money-pouch be wide and deep-and now,
 Master Stow," he said, as he found the old tailor upon both his knees,
 measuring his legs, " tell me, man, which think you, will best become my
 style of figure-the olden slops, and tight-drawn hose, or a neat pair of
 the new-fangled trousers ?"
  </p><p> By this observation, we may gather that trousers were beginning to be
 introduced in the time of Henry the Eighth.
 </p><p>"  With such a calf as thine," replied the old tailor, at the same time
 holding out about three-quarters of a yard of the measure, which he had
 just taken from around Brassinjaw's leg, " with such a calf as thine, it
 were a sin, a downright sin, to hide a morsel of your legs beneath those
 silly things called trousers, or 'neath ought beside."
  </p><p> "So Margery, my little housekeeper, has often said," replied Brassin-
jaw, "so let it be the slops and hose. And now good, Master Stow,
what's stirring in the world ?"
 </p><p>  " Stirring !" exclaimed the old tailor, suddenly becoming quite excited;
 " stirring! marry the whole world is stirring methinks, thanks to that
 villain, Cromwell-it's no use checking me-he is a villain, and there is
 but one still greater, and that is his minion, Harry Horton-he told me I
 should one day remember him, and I don't think it likely I shall ever
 forget either him or his master."
  </p><p> " But why this fury ?" enquired Brassinjaw; "what has Lord Cromwell done to thee ?"
  </p><p> "Done !" replied the other; "he has undone me. You know    my
 pretty house, and pretty garden, behind Throgmorton Street ? that house,
 abutted upon the palings of Lord Cromwell's grounds. He thought a tailor,
 I suppose, too mean a neighbour, to be so close to a dirty blacksmith's
 son, so coveted a portion of my land; but I loved my garden as my life.
 and swore I'd never part with it.  Now, would you believe it, or can
 you picture my surprise, when on reaching my home the other night, I
 found that Lord Cromwell had pulled down the pales, had undermined
 the foundations of my house, had placed it on huge rollers, and having
 wheeled it some two and twenty feet, there set it down again; a wall
 was then built up, and I was robbed of twenty and two feet of my own
 garden ground !"







<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>                  .

 </p><p> Strange as this circumstance may appear, it is no more strange than
true. The house was moved away on rollers, unknown to Stow, and
the ground added to Cromwell's garden, without the slightest remuneration being offered. Such was the tyranny of those times, that, notwithstanding the grossness of this outrage, " no man durst go to argue the the
matter ;" to add to the hardship, Stow  had still to pay his whole
rent, although one half of his garden had been taken from him; the
rent he paid will sound prodigious to a modern ear-it was no less a sum
than six and sixpence a year !
 </p><p> The tears quite came into the eyes of the old tailor, as he recounted
his wrongs, which he laid entirely to the spite of Horton, whom he said,
"he was sure had put the fancy into Lord Cromwell's mind."
</p><p>  " Oh ! then," said Brassinjaw, " you too have a small account to settle
with Horton, have ye ? I have one heavier perhaps than yours, but
leave it to me, Master Stow, leave it to me, and I'll get payment, with
interest too, for both of us. I never let my hawks fly until I am sure
they can strike their game-so be not in a hurry-but you shall be
paid to your heart's content; this I promise, and I'll keep my word.
And now, Master Stow, know ye any one deeply skilled in the mystery
of barbery ? Some cunning wight who can make a nostrum that shall
cause one's hair to grow both quick and thick ?"
  </p><p>The old tailor said he could not answer for the truth of what he had
heard, but that it was reported that, at that very moment there was to
be foundin the fair, the very man his new customer required-" Yes," he
said, " it is reported so wonderful is the power of this extraordinary pomade that an old lady mistaking it for lip salve, rubbed it over her upper
lip, when, in less than three days she had a pair of moustachios, of such
prolific growth, that she has been obliged to shave twice a-day ever since!
Having said this, the old man looked at Brassinjaw from under his
spectacles, as much as to say--" What do you think of that ?"
 </p><p> "That's my man!" exclaimed Brassinjaw, who having impressed
upon the old tailor's mind, that not a moment was to be lost in finishing
his new habiliments, at once hurried off to the fair.</p>

THE night on   which the fair closed, turned out wet and melancholy;
the wind whistled mournfully beneath the arches of the Bridge, and the
creaking sign-boards, as they swung slowly backwards and forwards,
sent forth a wailing sound, that to an imaginative mind, seemed like the
voices of weeping spirits, sighing o'er the dead.
  </p><p>Flora was sitting endeavouring to amuse her poor mistress, by telling
her fairy tales, and chanting the prettiest ditties of the day.  The one
she was now singing, was a prodigious favourite with the Bridge-shooter,




                       <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>

more perhaps on account of the fair writer, than for the merit of the
words-for be it known, it was written by Flora's self!  This attempt of
hers need scarcely be wondered at, for love makes all of us wonderfully
poetical.  Thus ran the lay:-</p><p>
               <quote rend="blockquote"><l> He says-" I'm like a nosegay rare,

  </p><p> When Flora ceased, the wind sighed its sad approval; it then became
 louder and  louder.   Alyce started-her countenance beaming with
 hope, for nothing could convince her but, that each sound she heard
 floating upon the night breeze, was the voice of her child.  Every few
 minutes Flora was compelled to open the casement and look out, and as
 the breezes rushed in, Alyce would exclaim, " There, there! I hear her
 plainly. Oh ! do, do let her come to me-the curse is taken from me
 now, and I may see her-indeed I may."
   </p><p>As the night advanced, the wind and rain increased, and anxiously
did Flora await the return of her master, with Edward and the Bridge-
shooter; for until the merchant came, she knew       it were useless to
endeavour to get Alyce to retire to rest. Her complaint had taken a perfectly new turn; instead of remaining for hours, nay days, without moving or speaking, she was now ever restless, ever talking;
this was regarded as a good sign, for no madness is so certainly incurable, as that of a fixed melancholy.
   </p><p>The bell of Saint Paul had struck ten--another hour passed-the
eleventh hour was heard, but still the merchant came not.   Flora, just
as the clock was striking the midnight hour, heard Master Hewet and
his companions entering the house. Alyce started, and running towards
the door of the apartment, would not believe but that her husband had
brought home her child.
  </p><p> "To-morrow, to-morrow, dear Alyce," said the merchant, to pacify
her, but he felt ashamed at deceiving one so dear to him, for he could







<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>                   .

not disguise from himself, how hopeless were his promises. He told
Flora, that from circumstances they had that day heard, there was really
some shadow of a chance of having at least their doubts resolved. The
sudden disappearance of the monster show, a day before the closing or
the fair, looked suspicious, it must be owned. Hewet had, he said, laid
a plan, by which the truth he hoped would be brought to light; he had
sent one of his most trusty men, one who had known the child from her
birth, to follow the show from place to place, as, in all probability, when
the parties, if they were really guilty of stealing away the child, were
far away from London, and off their guard, they would again employ
her as before. The mountebanks had gone, it was said, to Uxbridge, so
his spy had that night started upon their track.
 </p><p> As they were about to retire to rest, they all shuddered at hearing a
sound, the meaning of which they knew full well; it was that of some
poor drowning wretch, struggling against the pitiless waters of the
cataract beneath the Bridge-such accidents were almost of daily occurrence; they crossed themselves, and mentally offering up a prayer
for the soul of him, who had at that moment gone to another world, they
took their lamps, and retired to their various chambers.
  </p><p>Edward had just entered his own dormitory, when he remembered
that he had not secured the outer door, so once more descending, he
placed his hand upon the bolt, when he fancied he heard a moan! He
started; then looked around; but thinking it must have been merely
the sighing of the wind, he proceeded to finish his task, when the moan
again struck upon his ear, more sadly than before; he could not imagine
whence the sound proceeded.  He listened-all was still-again he
listened; when suddenly his doubts were doubts no longer; the person
in distress, he now felt sure, was lying near the door--he opened it-the
rush of the wind had nearly extinguished his lamp. In another moment,
those above were frightfully alarmed at hearing Edward calling aloud, as
if he had gone mad; they hurried down, where they saw Osborne kneeling by some helpless human being.
 </p><p> Hewet flew to lend his assistance, when who can paint the scene which
followed, for in another moment the merchant was holding in his arms
his own, his long lost child !
 </p><p> So suddenly, so unexpectedly had this happiness burst upon the merchant, that he gave himself no time for reflection, but at once hurried
with his precious load into the presence of his wife, exclaiming--" Alyce,
Alyce, God be thanked, for he has heard our prayer, she is here !"
 </p><p> Had Hewet thought for an instant of the overpowering effect, that
such an unprepared restoration of the child might have had upon his wife,
he would not have dared this venture; but it was done, and he now
trembled for the consequence.
 </p><p> So strangely had Alyce been working upon her own shattered mind,
that when she embraced her child, she did so, certainly with all the true
feeling of a doting mother, but without any approach to that overwhelming burst of joy and wonder, that might have been looked for in
ordinary cases; no, the coming of her soul's idol seemed to her as a
thing of course.
 </p><p> "I told you, William," she said, "I told you, she would return'









                                            <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

 often have I heard her gentle voice, whispering into my ear in the dead
 of night -' Weep not, mother, weep not for me-for I am safe; I will
 return; I will conquer the evil fiend, and then I will come again;' did
 you not say so, Anne ? did you not whisper those words of hope into
 your mother's ear ? But for that hope, I had gone mad-I had gone mad."
  </p><p> The child was so overcome with fatigue and suffering, with fear,
 hope, wonder, joy, that for a time she neither saw nor heard what passed
 around her. All she did was to cling round the neck of her mother, and
 sobbing, repeat again and again-" Are you not my mother ?-my real,
 real, mother ? Oh, tell me you are, or kill me-kill me !"
  </p><p> Flora did not hesitate for a moment to give way to her feelings, so
supporting herself in a corner of the room, she roared out lustily.
 </p><p>  Edward and the Bridge-shooter stood looking at each other very
 stoically, as much as to say, " Will you cry ? I wont, if you don't ?"
 But in spite of all their contortions of visage, and sundry little gulps, a
 vast deal more of the heart's dew would hang about their eyelids, than
 they were willing, or would have allowed, to be seen there.
 </p><p>  Again and again did the child cling, first to the neck of her mother,
then to that of the merchant; when presently, turning and seeing Flora
standing with open arms, she quite screamed with joy, and flew into
them; their embrace was mutually loving and sincere. She laughed
and cried both, as she embraced her childhood's playmate, Edward, but
checked herself suddenly, as she was going to bestow the same endearment upon Flora's lover, in whom she fancied she saw a perfect stranger;
the Bridge-shooter she only remembered in his rags and tatters.
 </p><p>  Poor William felt quite hurt that he should not be recognised, so
blubbered out-" Why, don't you know me, Mistress Anne ? and have
you quite forgotten poor ragged Billy-the-bridge-shooter ?"
  </p><p> " No, no ! indeed I have not !" said Anne running to him, " it was
you who taught dear Edward how to save my life-bless you, bless
you !"
  </p><p> William was so delighted, that he seized up the child and completely
swung her round, as he kissed her. When he put her down again, he
said, " Mother is a witch-upon my life I'm afraid she is-she has
always said that little Anne, for that's what she calls Mistress Anne,
would start up when we least expected it, and I'm sure we least expected it such an awful night as this. I hope she may prove a witch in
everything;" then whispering to Flora, he said "for she tells me
that our dear mistress, there, will yet be wiser than ever, now she has no
holy father near her; that's wicked though, isn't it?"
  </p><p>" I'm not quite sure," replied Flora, in a like whisper; the truth was,
Flora had become a little tainted with the coming protestantism of the
day, and therefore eyed the old-fashioned priestcraft with a rather doubting glance.
 </p><p>  When the first burst of joy and astonishment had in a degree subsided,
they began to turn their thoughts to the arrangements for the night. It
was at once settled, that until the morning, no questions should be put
to little Anne, as they still called her, concerning what had happened to
her since her abduction, three years before. This was a sore trial to all,
for all were burning with curiosity. But the-child's care-worn look, and







<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>                   .

the state of her feet, which they now, for the first time, perceived were
partially bandaged up in rags, and other parts bare, and torn by wandering over the rough and rugged roads, induced them to conclude that
the sooner she could be consigned to sleep's soothing care the better.
  </p><p> As Anne was to pass that night with her mother, the first for three
long years, it was arranged that Edward should resign his room to the
merchant, and himself take up his quarters in Horton's former dormitory.
 </p><p>  We will not attempt to describe the varied feelings of this now happy
party, as they, laughing and crying, and hugging the child again and
again in their arms, took their leave of each other for the night.
 </p><p>  What appeared to amuse Flora most, was her own perplexity in not
knowing where she should find proper clothes for her young mistress ; for,
as she said, " I'm sure it's no use bringing her own old things, for she's
grown out of all knowledge, and is really quite a woman !"
 </p><p> It was certainly true that Anne had grown, even more than is usually
the case, in a like space of time; and from the life of care which she
had lately passed, her countenance had all the thoughtful expression of
one far older; she had, in fact, become a woman in her childhood.
 </p><p> Although the weather continued as stormy, and the wind howled
as sadly, as it passed along the Bridge, yet the inmates of the merchant's
dwelling heeded them not; there was a bright sun shining in all their
hearts, that seemed to light up every object with its own golden rays.
Edward Osborne hummed a cheerful air as he descended towards the sleeping room of his former fellow-apprentice; and the Bridge-shooter, so
far forgot himself in his feelings of content, that for some time after he
had ascended to the top of the house, he could be heard whistling in
high glee; and there was a peculiar sound, as if he were dancing to his
own music.
 </p><p> Horton's old room had, in a certain degree, changed its appearance
very much since he had last seen it; in fact, it had been made the
magazine of warlike arms, belonging to the peaceful garrison of Hewet's
citadel of the Golden Fleece!
 </p><p> The truth was, that ever since the Pope's bull of excommunication
against Henry had been promulgated, which bull had been long before
prepared, but had been kept back in terrorem, until his Holiness should
be quite convinced that Henry was an incorrigible and disobedient son
of Rome-warlike preparations had been going on throughout the King's
dominions. As many of our readers may have often heard of excommunications, without perhaps being aware of the gentle, charitable,
wording of such works, we will give an extract, and leave it to their own
minds to decide, whether such document was not more beseeming the
invention of a fiend, then becoming the Christian feelings of Heaven's
Vicegerent, as the Pope professed himself to be.
 </p><p> The Bishop being clothed in white, and accompanied by other priests
belonging to the church, with uplifted cross and candles burning, stood
up in the pulpit, and said, " By the authority of God the Father Almighty,
and of the blessed Virgin Mary and all the Saints, we excommunicate,
and anathematise, and deliver over to the devil all the aforesaid malefactors, that excommunicated, anathematised, and delivered over to the
devil they may be;" the following surely must have been penned by







                      <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

Beelzebub himself:-" Accursed be they in towns, in fields, in highways,
in footpaths, under roofs, out of doors, and in all other places, standing,
sitting, lying down, rising up, walking, running, awake, asleep, eating
drinking, and doing whatsoever other thing; from all illumination, and
all other good things of the church we debar them; to the devil we condemn them ; and in the pains of hell-fire we extinguish their souls-unless
they repent and make SATISFACTION, even as this candle is extinguished."
And so having said, to strike the more terror, amidst the sounding of
bells he put out the light.
  </p><p>Although Henry the Eighth lived in an age which had become sufficiently enlightened to allow kings to smile at such impotent blasphemy,
there had been times when such denunciations would bring the mightiest
potentates crouching bare-headed, bare-footed, on their hands and knees,
to supplicate at the foot of the Pope, his intercession with Heaven, to
remove such a weighty curse.
 </p><p> Although excommunication was one of the most powerful weapons
wielded by the once-resistless head of the Romish Church, and was by that
head so frequently employed for political as well as religious purposes,
yet it was not, and is not confined exclusively to the Pope; nor, if such
anathema could really send man's soul to perdition, is the Pope himself quite safe; for in the Greek Church, the Patriarch of Jerusalem
annually excommunicated, not only the Pope, but the whole Church of
Rome! There are one or two oddities connected with the Greek excommunication; for it condemns the body of offenders after death to
remain " as hard as a flint, or piece of steel."  And, as the Greeks believe, that if a person die excommunicated, the devil immediately enters
into the lifeless corpse, the relatives, to prevent him, cut the body in
pieces, and boil them in wine. Now, for ourselves, we had always
imagined that wine was far more likely to bring the evil spirit, than to
keep him away; but it appears we are never too old to learn.
 </p><p> It is true that Henry had the courage to set the Pope and all his
Bulls at defiance; but as the kingdom was still a Roman Catholic
kingdom, and remained so until the death of Henry-for, as it has been
correctly stated, Henry did not object to the Pope nor his power, but to
the person-in short, in his own kingdom he wished to be himself the
Pope-and in his capacity of "supreme head of the church," he exercised quite as great a system of tyranny as ever did the Bishop of Rome
-the title by which the Pope was henceforth to be known in England.
  </p><p>The Bishop of Rome now being convinced that further attempts to
reclaim Henry, and bring him back to " holy obedience" would prove
abortive, set seriously to work in uniting in one bond the Catholic princes
of the continent.  He made strenuous efforts, which, at last, were
crowned with success, to bring about a reconciliation between the two
great enemies, Charles the Fifth, Emperor of Germany, and Francis the
First, King of France.  A truce for ten years was concluded between
these two powerful sovereigns, which circumstance not only alarmed
Henry, but the whole kingdom; for it was currently reported, and
believed too, that Francis and Charles were to head a league against
this land.
 </p><p> So ill prepared was Henry for war, that he was in a continued state







<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>                   .

of fear and alarm  He now, too, began to be suspicious of his own
subjects. So many cruelties had been inflicted upon all sects and parties, who, in any way dared to differ from him, that people began to get
tired of such atrocities; and it may be doubted, but for the mutual hatred
of the now rising Reformists, and the champions of the old religion, whether
or not Henry the Eighth might not have been driven from his throne.
 </p><p> To allay the King's fears was a most troublesome task for Cromwell,
who, in order to obtain all the secret information he could from abroad,
kept spies "in Rome, Naples, Milan, Genoa, Venice, Madrid, Paris,
Brussels, Frankfort, and in almost every corner of Europe."  We need
scarcely say that Horton and Spikely had been more than once employed
upon this service. To raise a feeling of security in the minds of the citizens
of London, and give an appearance of preparation to enemies abroad, all
the males between sixteen and sixty years of age were once more
enrolled, and exercised in the discipline of war.
 </p><p> This circumstance accounts for Horton's old room being, as we have
before remarked, greatly changed in appearance; for the walls were
everywhere hung with accoutrements of one sort or another.
 </p><p> The merchant Hewet was a captain of archers; and Edward, with
William-the-bridge-shooter, two of his men; and very proud the two
latter were, when they appeared in public armed to their teeth.
 </p><p> Before Edward retired to his couch, he amused himself for some time
in examining the various arms. He greatly admired his master's sword,
which was adorned after the Asiatic fashion, that is, damasquin&#x00E9;e, or
inlaid with gold-an adornment lately introduced into Europe by Benvenuto Cellini. In examining his own dag, or tacke, or, in other words,
a pistol-the only difference between a pistol and a tacke was, that
the former had a knob at the end, whilst the butt of the latter was
merely cut in a slanting direction-in pretending to go through the
practice of loading these fire-arms, Edward discovered that one of the
dags was still charged.
 </p><p> " How thoughtless of William," said he, "to leave his arms in this
dangerous condition."
 </p><p> He said William, but had he looked a little closer at the weapon, he
would have found his own name upon it; but, as is usual with most
people, it never struck him that he himself could be so silly, therefore
the blame naturally was thrown upon some other person's shoulders.
 </p><p> "Well," said he, as he approached the window with the intention
of discharging the dag, but checking himself, laid the weapon down on a
chest near his bed, "well, it must remain so, I suppose, until the morning, for if I fire it from the window, it may alarm, not only our house,
but the neighbours too."
  </p><p>So, now, turning his mind upon the strange reappearance of his former darling little playmate, Anne, he prepared to go to rest.
 </p><p> " Poor child !" he said, "what a miserable plight was she in. Hers
will be a marvellous tale, I suspect. I'm longing for to-morrow."
 </p><p> Having extinguished his lamp, he went to the little window, and
casting his eyes towards the heavens-" Come," said he, " the clouds
are breaking fast, and the strong wind will soon disperse them. I love
to see the moon shining upon the water.   Every silver ripple seems








.                        <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

to me like a row of tiny spirits, dancing in their own light.  The
moon is at the full, and even now is labouring hard to get a peep at
our dark and sleeping world. Good night, fair queen !" he continued,
nodding to the moon, as it for an instant became visible between two
dark rolling clouds, "good night! I am too tired to wait until you
have subdued your black and vaporous enemies."
  </p><p> Edward threw himself upon his couch, where he lay for some time,
 turning over and over in his mind all the strange events of the last
 three years: as he became more and more drowsy, the dreadful night of
 the marsh came, in all the vivid colouring of a dream, before his mind's
 eye: he started wide awake, for he had experienced that very peculiar
 sensation, not uncommon between waking and sleeping, of suddenly falling from a great height. The light of the moon was now beginning to
 shine, although faintly, in at the little window. Feeling quite unnerved
 by the impression his dreamy thoughts had made upon his mind, he
 covered his head up with the bed clothes, and tried to compose his
 nerves in the forgetfulness of sleep. He had been lying thus for some
 time, and counting over and over again numbers from one up to a thousand, to try to bring on slumber: this failing, he shut his eyes, and endeavoured to fancy he saw long lines of sheep wandering along the edge
 of a mountain, and by counting them one by one, keep unpleasant
 thoughts away, and thus at last unconsciously sink into the realms of
 Morpheus. Just when forgetfulness was exerting her power over memory, he was startled by a strange sort of creaking, wrenching noise;
 he listened; then raising the clothes more from off his head, he felt convinced it came from that part of the room in which the window was
 placed. He now recollected the former attempt at robbery which had
 actually been made in that very room; he slowly raised his head until
 he could see the window; the night was still hazy, but sufficient light
 was in the heavens to render the window very apparent: presently he
 saw a hand holding a wrenching-tool rise up; the tool was applied to
 the casement, which had, ever since the former attempt, been kept securely fastened. Osborne blessed the chance which had left him the
 loaded weapon; he seized it firmly in his grasp, and remained quietly
 watching the progress the robber was making, determined not to stir until he could take his aim with certainty and effect: he was not long kept
 in anxious suspense, for the thief appeared to be so thoroughly a master of
 his trade, that in a very few minutes the casement gave way, and turned
 back upon its hinges. Osborne now trembled, not with fear, but from
 a strange feeling that in another minute, perhaps, he should have sent
 an erring human being to his dread account; a moment more, and he
 would have started up to alarm the robber, and thus enable him to
 escape, but ere he could determine upon which course to pursue, the
 head of a man was seen above the sill of the window; bang went the
 pistol; one cry was heard; and then the heavy dash of some one falling
 into the flood beneath.
  </p><p> Edward sprang from his bed, intending to fly to the casement, but
 was suddenly checked by striking his foot against something sharp in
 the floor, which cut his foot severely. As soon as the first shock of
 pain was past, he limped to the window; but nothing could he there







<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>                  .

discover, excepting the rope which Horton so long before had placed
there for his own purposes. He drew that into the room; then hastened
to the door, intending to acquaint his master with what had happened;
and whom, with the other inmates of the dwelling, he doubted not must
be already alarmed.
 </p><p> Not hearing the least noise in the house, he believed, which was the
truth, that all but himself still slept; so he determined not to disturb
them. He again closed his door-barred up the window in the strongest
way he could; and having not only loaded his own brace of dags, he
loaded those belonging to William as well. He placed them in a row
before him on the bed; then, resting his back against the wall at the
head of his couch, passed the remainder of the night in watching.

FLORA and the Bridge-shooter were up by times, and never did two
lovers-for they now no longer disguised their affections from each other
-go to work with such happy hearts as they did while preparing for
the family breakfast.  William himself gave the last polish to the pewter platters; for the return of the child was an occasion too joyous to be
treated but as a fete, therefore Flora had, unbidden, brought out some
of the best things in the house.
 </p><p> The silver tankards were all displayed on a side buffet. William had
knocked up at least half a dozen of their neighbours to procure sundry
dainties, such as sea-gulls, served up in cold jelly; reys and ruffs, and
delicious venison pasty, too, were procured; and conger eels, in a rich
sauce of cream. Then there were fruits, among which were plums
that had been introduced from Italy by Cromwell himself in <date value="1510">1510</date>. A
great addition to our fruits had been lately made; for instance, the pale
gooseberry, the apricot, and the musk-melon from the Netherlands, had
not been known in England twenty years before; and cherries were
only just brought into notice. To the Netherlands we also owe our
salads and our cabbages, which were first brought over about <date value="1524">1524</date>.
Pippins came about a year after; and artichokes were not cultivated
until this reign. Currants, which afterwards came from Zante, were
not yet known-not indeed until <date value="1555">1555</date>.
 </p><p> The superb breakfast now being laid out, was rendered complete
by several flagons of Cromwell's sweetest ale. All the flower vases,
containing the hop plant-for hops were as yet regarded in scarcely
any other light than that of a garden plant-were brought into the
breakfast room; so that when the merchant, who was the next to
make his appearance, entered, he was quite struck and delighted







                                          <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>

at Flora's forethought and taste. The merchant's countenance beamed
with joy, as he thanked them both for their kindness, and thought of the
blessed occasion, for which these preparations had been made.
  </p><p>" So happily had I gone to rest last night," observed the merchant,
"that I had scarcely placed my head upon the pillow, ere I was lost
in profound slumber, and- I fear me, I have overslept myself this morning.
Where's Edward ?"
  </p><p> They said " no doubt that he too had slept soundly, and not believing
that any would that morning be inclined to very early rising, he played
the sluggard."  Scarcely had they said this, when Edward entered, and
surprised them greatly by his limping gait; but they were far more
astonished, when he related what had passed during the night. On
speaking of his lameness, he held forth a sharp piece of steel, which he
said he had discovered stuck deeply into the floor of Horton's room; it
was evidently the point of a knife or dagger, and was stained with rust,
or something that looked more like blood.
  </p><p> Osborne was about to throw it into the river, when William said it
would do capitally for him to scratch out the blots he was always making
in his copy books; so taking it from Edward, he carefully placed it in
his pouch.
  </p><p> Flora now went to call her mistress, but soon returned with her and
the child; they had been up before any in the house, and Anne had
been so industriously at work, that she had cut and contrived the things
her mother had given her, so judiciously, that she appeared quite a " lady
again," as Flora said.
  </p><p> The moment the child saw the merchant, she run to him, and throwing
her arms round his neck, exclaimed-" Then you are indeed my father,
and you will never again give me to that wicked woman, who used to
beat me so; will you, father ?"
 </p><p>  "No, no, dear child," said Hewet, kissing her tenderly, " you have
nothing more to fear from any mortal living; having once regained our
treasure, we will guard it as our lives."
 </p><p>  Anne evinced great anxiety at observing Edward's lameness, but he
passed it off as a mere trifling hurt in his foot, and not worth a thought.
Not a word was said about the attempted robbery, fearing that it might
alarm Alyce and the child. They now sat down to the morning meal;
William alone acted as carver and waiter, for in consequence of Edward's
hurt, he did not act this morning in his usual capacity of assistant
to his master and mistress.
 </p><p>  Every moment Anne's eyes were wandering from one spot to another, as
 she recalled to her memory the various objects, that had so often recurred
 to her mind, in the mysterious visions of sleep  " Ah," she said, "how
 often used I to dream of this dear room, and then awake with my eyes
 streaming with tears: how I used to pray that I might one day, only
 for one day, be here again as I used to be; and now to think that I am
 really, really here !-or, perhaps, I am dreaming now-oh, Heaven, grant
 that it be not a dream !"  As she said this, she looked round imploringly; anxiety was depicted on her beautiful countenance-"Oh, do
 speak," she said, " and tell me it is not a dream !"
 "No, love," replied the merchant, "only look upon the misery you






<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>                   .

have just escaped from, as a dream; all the happiness you see here is
real. But what meant you by praying of me not again to give you to
that wicked woman? Did you not know that you had been stolen
away ?"
 </p><p> "     Oh, no! I was made to believe," replied Anne, " that I was really
the child of that cruel woman, Nan."
 </p><p> " Nan !" exclaimed every one present.
  </p><p>"Yes," said the child, " Nan; she was always called Nan; I never
heard any other name; but she had had a good many, for she had
been married six times."
 </p><p> This assertion caused Flora to lift up her eyes in horror, as the child
went on.
 </p><p> "Her present husband is called Ray-Ray the Clipper."
 </p><p> "And what's a clipper ?" enquired Flora, in astonishment.
 </p><p> "What, don't you know that ?" said the child, quite innocently; "oh,
a clipper is any one who gets his living by cutting people's purses; Ray
was once quite celebrated, but left off that business when he married my
mother-no, no, I don't mean that-I don't mean my own dear mother
here-I mean Nan."
</p><p>  " But who is Nan, dear ?" enquired the merchant.
 </p><p> " You remember," said the child, turning towards Flora and Edward,
" the woman who came here on that dreadful day, three years ago?
Oh, that day ! never, never shall I forget that day !" Anne shuddering
cast a glance round the room, as if almost expecting to see the wretch lurking in some comer, ready to seize her-" That woman was Nan. She
told you that she was to take me to my mother. You recollect how
joyously I left the house with her, for I thought she had then told me
the truth. My father, you know, was away with Horton-how strange
I should never think of him, and yet I used always to be thinking of
Edward-but where is Horton ?"
 </p><p> The merchant placed his finger upon his lips. Alyce had fortunately not heard the name, and the child had for so long been schooled
to understand the merest glance, that she felt that that was a name, for
some reason or other, not to be spoken, so continued-" I sang and
danced along across the Bridge, the woman holding fast by my hand.
The moment we had quitted the Bridge, she turned suddenly down to
the Bank-side, and along some miserable and dirty lanes. I began to cry
with fear; she dragged me on violently, and with horrid oaths, declared
she would murder me, if I did not instantly cease my howling. We
went on and on, through places I had never seen before, to one more
dark and horrible than any I had yet passed through-it was called the
black arch of the Clink."
 </p><p> " I know it well," exclaimed William, " and a viler spot is not in this
great kingdom. Why, none but thieves and murderers ever dwell there
-it's the rogues' sanctuary, and woe betide the honest foot that treads
that path."
  </p><p>"At that black arch," continued Anne Hewet, "there are three
miserable dwellings; the entrance to one of them was by a vast flight of
rugged stone steps; she dragged me up the whole of them on my back, for
I had become so frightened, that I screamed, and struggled to get away;







                                          <pb id="p.179" n="179"/>

but I was very little then, and she dragged me up as easily as if I had
been a feather, for Nan was wonderfully strong  When she had me
securely in the room above, she gave me a violent blow on the side of
the head, and said, 'Now, mark me, if you cease not your bellowing
I'll strip your skin off as quickly as I do these clothes;' saying this she,
began to tear off my things.
  </p><p>" Where, where is my mother ?' I screamed out. 'Here,' she said,
there-I am your mother-the only mother that you will ever know.'
'No,' I said, ' you are not my mother; she's all goodness and kindness,
she --' ' She has done with you,' she replied; ' and now know the
truth-you were never Dame Hewet's child-but mine. I lent you to
her when she had lost her own; she paid me for the loan; but she has
found her real daughter, and has returned you upon my hands; so now
you know they have turned you off, you will learn to obey me, as a
child should do, or--but you know the weight of my hand already, so
dread it and be silent."
</p><p>  The poor girl here began to weep, and indeed there were more tear-
filled eyes than her own.
  </p><p>"Oh, mother !" she exclaimed, as she kissed her passionately, " think
what I suffered upon hearing that cruel woman say I had lost you for
ever, and that you had found another child, and cared no more for the
little thing you used to caress so fondly, and seem so proud of! But I
won't cry any more-no, no, indeed I won't; so dry your eyes, dear
mother, and I'll tell you all the rest some other time."
  </p><p>" No, dear-now, now !" said Alyce, appearing quite to understand
all that her child was saying.
 </p><p> " Well then, I will; but if anybody cries I shall stop; it was all my
fault; I had no business to cry, now I am so happy; and it seems strange,
that I, who but yesterday could have checked my tears in an instant,
had Nan but looked at me, should now find it so difficult."
 </p><p> Edward took one of her hands and held it kindly within his own, as
Anne proceeded. "The woman soon stripped off all my good clothes,
and replaced them with complete rags; then making a fire, she burnt
everything that had belonged to me. As she sat over the fire, I crept
into a dark corner, and crouching down, wept myself fast asleep. When
I awoke, I found myself quite alone; the room was large and dark; for
a time I knew not where I was. I listened for the falling of the waters;
that well-known sound was gone--all seemed in death-like silence; a
few rays of the moon stole in at the broken window, which caused such
strange forms on the walls and floor, that I screamed with fear. I found the
door; it was fastened securely on the outside. Oh ! I tremble now whenever I think of that horrid night. All sorts of dreadful fancies came into my
mind: I thought, perhaps, I was to be shut up there, and starved to death.
I went to the casement; it was very high from the ground-not a sound
was to be heard. I watched the moon; it must have been for hours; at last
that sank, and I was in total darkness. Presently I fancied I heard
a footstep approaching. I cared not who it might be, for it was so
dreadful to be alone, that even the presence of my cruel mother, as I was
now to believe that woman, seemed a blessing to be coveted; the door
opened, and Nan came in.







<pb id="p.180" n="180"/>                  .
 </p><p> Has no one been ?' she said; ' I expected them, long ere this.' Nan
then lighting a lamp, took out some food from a basket she had brought
with her, and placing it on the table gave me some, and desired me to
take it with me to my bed, and after eating it, to go to sleep as speedily
as I could She pointed out a place under the stairs, that led to an
upper room, in which was a little hay and straw-this was my bed.
How I ever lived over that dreadful night seems to me now a wonder,
nay, a miracle. Oh! how I thought of my own dear, dear little room;
and then I fancied all that you might then be doing; and then I pictured
to myself the kind looks that used to be lavished upon me, when we
parted for the night, but that were now to be bestowed upon another,
and I to be left in that horrid place : with that cruel thought, my heart
felt sick with grief. How little did I imagine the trouble you were all
in on my account. But why should that woman have stolen me away ?
can you, dear father, tell the cause ?"
 </p><p> " No," said her father; " if you, my dear child, have not been able to
discover the reason for that wicked act, it must still remain a mystery.
I have never, to my knowledge, wronged a human being."
 </p><p> " That I am sure of, father; but there was one amongst them, when I
first was taken away, that appeared to have a dreadful hatred to all in
this house."
 </p><p> " And who was he ?" enquired the merchant, astonished.
 </p><p> " I never knew his name-but he came to the Clink in the middle of
the night with two others; one was Ray the Clipper; the other was
wet through and through, as though he had been thrown into the river.
I couldn't then understand what they said, for they spoke in a language
quite new to my ears-they used the strangest words-but strange as
they were, I dare say I could understand them now, for I have had plenty
of practice in odd-sounding jargons, only known to those who use them.
I watched them from the dark place in which I lay beneath the stairs;
now and then I caught some sound that was familiar to me. I heard
your name, father, and Edward's; and the tallest of the men seemed
delighted when Nan pointed to the spot wherein I lay. And then the
tall man kissed Nan, and Ray looked savage. At last they all ascended
to the rooms above, and I, worn out with grief, at last fell into a deep
slumber.
 </p><p> " The men remained there for some days, but from their anxious looks,
and incessant watchings from the casement, it seemed to me that they were
fearful of being surprised. There were always mysterious nods and winks,
and signs going on between Nan and the Clipper. On the last day I was
in that dreadful place, I heard above my head the whole four quarrelling
and fighting-oh, it was dreadful to listen to ! Presently Ray rushed
down the stairs, his face covered with blood; he was pursued by the tall
man, who, seizing him just as he had reached the door, hurled him
headlong down the long steps, up which I had been so cruelly dragged.
I knew how hard they were, and I shuddered as I heard him strike
against them in his fall.  The woman who was screaming above,
and evidently endeavouring to overcome the other man, at last rushed
down, frantic, and foaming with rage. 'Have you murdered him ?' she
exclaimed.' 'I hope I have,' was the tall man's reply; 'go to him, wretch,








.                          <pb id="p.181" n="181"/>

and if his neck be not broken, no doubt the charm of your fair arms,
if flung around it, will soon make all right again.' The woman looked at
him as if she could have struck him dead with her eyes-for Nan had
the eyes of a tiger when she was in a rage; but this fearful look only
caused the man, who seemed to have the strength of a giant, to burst
into a violent laugh, and snapping his fingers at Nan, he again ascended
to the upper floor."
</p><p>At this pause, the whole party drew a long breath, but so interested
had they become, that as the Bridge-shooter appeared about to speak,
the others, as if actuated by a single feeling, placed their fingers
upon their lips, fearful of breaking the thread of the child's exciting
narrative.
  </p><p>Anne, appearing to comprehend their feelings, continued-" The
  woman bit her lips, until I saw the blood come from them; then striking
  her forehead two or three times with her clenched hand, she turned
  suddenly to where I was crouching in fear; she seized me by the hand,
  and said, ' Come, come with me-this day shall end my slavery; my
  heart is now fixed, fixed as a rock-and he shall find it as hard as one,
  or I will tear it from out my breast, and-- But come, come; life or
death may hang upon my speed.' I felt relieved at the chance of any
change, and as I then thought she was, in truth, my mother, I had
already seen enough to know how useless it would be to oppose her, be
her commands whate'er they might. I started up, and with her hurried
from the place. As we descended, we found the stones were spotted
all down with blood; this sight seemed to add speed to her steps. We
entered beneath the black arch; no one was there; we proceeded further
on, when she soon found the object she sought. Ray was seated upon a
stone, stanching the blood which flowed from a dreadful wound in his
head. 'Ray,' said the woman,' I have determined; your plans now are
mine; this day's work has settled all between us. But tarry not here-
he will soon discover my intentions, and then woe to us both if we are
overtaken in this vile place.' The rest of my story is soon told," said
Anne. " Ray had just bought a show that went from fair to fair. I was
made to dance, to sing, to do anything. At last the idea struck Ray,
that as a contrast to the monster he had engaged, I should be exhibited
as the youthful Venus: they dressed me up in all sorts of finery, and
tried to persuade the people (and you have no idea, until you try it, how
easily people are persuaded), that my hair was the most beautiful that
had ever grown upon mortal head-that my face was the fairest that had
ever been placed on mortal shoulders-that my eyes--but you know
what stories they tell at fairs; and I was proclaimed to be a perfect
angel."
 </p><p> " And so you are, my dear child," said Alyce, kissing her, "you are
an angel, for you have been the salvation of my soul."
</p><p>  The poor merchant sighed, as he heard his beloved wife still touching
  upon that theme, the one on which he knew all her intellect had been
  wrecked, if not for ever lost.
</p><p>  Then it was you we saw at the monster show ?" exclaimed Flora;
"and that was the wretch of a woman who stole you away ?  I knew it
was--I knew it was !"







<pb id="p.182" n="182"/>                    .

 </p><p>  "And Ray," said Edward, "the Clipper, as you call him, was no
 doubt the monster I suspected him to be."
  </p><p> "And, oh, gracious !" said the Bridge-shooter, " then it might have
 been you I heard screaming, as the van passed the house, in its way
 across the Bridge ?"
  </p><p> "It was," replied Anne, in a tone of horror, as she remembered the
 dreadful beating she had received upon that occasion.
 </p><p>  Not one who heard her relate the cruelty she had endured, for having
 tried to look, but for a moment, at her once-happy home, could stifle
 their indignation. All were violent in execrating the wretch, Nan.
 </p><p>  The merchant, striking the table with his clenched hand, exclaimed,
 "If I but live, there is not a wretch amongst them that shall not be
 hunted down, and brought to justice: no, not one of them shall escape
 my vengeance."
  </p><p> " Oh, yes," said Anne, clinging to her father's arm, " yes, yes, there's
 one-one who has ever been kind to the poor child, when she thought
 she had no other friend on earth."
  </p><p> " Kind to you?" said the merchant, "to you, Anne-to you, my
 poor child? then God's blessing light upon him !-he shall never want
 again; he shall be rich-he shall be happy, if wealth can make him so
 -quickly tell me who it was."
   </p><p>" I never heard his real name," replied Anne; "amongst us he was
 always called the Old Devil."
   </p><p>"The what !" exclaimed every one who heard her.
   </p><p>"The Old Devil," repeated the child, as though there had been no
 more meaning in the name, than there is in Jack, or Tom, or Bill, or
 Joe; and indeed as it passed through her lips it seemed to be sanctified,
 and to lose all its original wicked import.
  </p><p> "And what was the old--gentleman ?" said Flora, not possessing
courage sufficient to let her lips pronounce such a wicked name.
  </p><p> " Oh, the Old Devil," repeated Anne, " oh, he was Nan's father."
  </p><p> "I thought so," said the Bridge-shooter. "Egad, no one, but the
Old Devil, could have had such a child."
   </p><p>"But he was so kind to me," continued Anne; " often and often used
he to starve himself, that I might not be hungered. They used to treat
him much worse than they did me, for he was old and worn out; and
even his daughter, at times, would strike him, and ask him why he did
not die-oh, they were very cruel to him! But when we got alone-
together, and he was not afraid," said the child, quite warming with the
subject, and seeming to look back with pleasure to those moments, "he
used to make me forget all my misery, and then would he tell me the
strange chances of his early life: but he was not bad-indeed he was not,
though he used to think he had been; and then he'd teach me to
read-"
 </p><p> Here she hesitated for some time, and she then continued-" Yes, I
may tell you-he had an old copy, I mean one torn and worn, for he told-
me that there were none yet really old in all England. Yes, he had a
tattered copy of the New Testament in our own language, and we used
to read it together,. and it was so beautiful; and it used to make me






                                            <pb id="p.183" n="183"/>

hope and feel so happy whilst we read it. He used to hide it from
everybody but from me; for he told me that he was what they called a
heretic, and that if that were known they would tie him to a stake and
burn him alive in Smithfield.  Now, can you tell me, father, why they
should wish to burn the poor old man for being good, and reading the
best book, as he said, that ever come upon earth !"
 </p><p>  This was a question rather difficult to answer; so each looked at the
other, and all held their peace.
  </p><p>" He told me too," she continued, " that there was a wonderful man
beyond the seas, called Luther, who was fighting against the Pope, and
that our King Henry had been, I mean in books, fighting against him,
and that how God was making Henry, in spite of himself, work like a
slave to build up the towers of true faith upon the foundations laid by
the very man he professed to despise-the good, the unanswerable
Luther. I am still too much of a child to understand exactly what he
meant; but this I understand, that all he said was kind, was charitable,
was good."
 </p><p> " Ah, me !" sighed Alyce; " would that I could bring him back from
the error of his ways !"
 </p><p> It is true that this ejaculation emanated from a poor soul partially
deprived of sense, otherwise those who heard her might have wondered
wherein " the error of a man's ways lay, who was kind, was charitable,
and good ;" but in those days the name of a sect bore more weight,
than the acts of its members, whether good or evil. Alyce had caught
the word heretic, and that word, to her benighted mind, contained all
errors of the human heart.
 </p><p> Even the good merchant, being still a Roman Catholic, felt a doubt
creeping into his heart, like a cancer, to dry up its purest blood, and
eat away its vital part, CHARITY; for he could not yet comprehend how
it were possible a heretic could be good. 'Tis true, his sense of gratitude
knew no bounds towards the old man who had befriended his child in her
affliction; but then he sighed to think that her benefactor was not of the
creed to which he still so firmly, so undoubtingly adhered. His wavering thoughts were made firm, immoveably rooted in his heart, as he
learnt that but for that poor old man, he perhaps had never again beheld
his long-lost, his unceasingly-prayed-for child; for Anne now began to
detail the circumstances which led to her ultimate return to her dear
loved home.
 </p><p> She told them of all that had passed after her mother had so alarmed
the people in the show; all about the changing of the dresses, which at
that time she had not been able at all to comprehend: then she described
to them how she had listened to Nan and the Clipper, as she peeped
from beneath her tent, and had, from their lips, discovered all the truth.
" And, oh," she said, " I thought my heart would have betrayed me to
them, it beat so loudly, as I heard them own that I was not Nan's child,
but yours. I had often before thought of running away, and coming
here to throw myself on my knees, and pray to be your servant, so that
might be near you all; but then, I knew that if that wicked woman
were indeed my mother, you could have no power to keep me from her,
and I should be used far worse when she got me back again; but now







<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>                   .

now I had learnt the truth, my heart bounded within my breast. I
could not rest an instant.  I silently tore away part of the covering of
my tent, and creeping out, crawled along on my hands and knees, as
close as I could to the ground, fearing, in the moonlight I might be seen,
and to have been detected at that moment would have cost me my life.
I knew that full well. When I believed myself out of their sight, I
arose to my feet, and sore and bleeding as they were, I flew across the
heath towards the Tybourne Tree; but before I reached it I was once more
obliged to hide, for the jingling of our horses' bells told me the rest of
our troop were coming. When they had passed, so much worse had my
feet become, that I was again compelled to crawl along; and when I
thought of the distance I must travel ere I should reach this spot,
all hope seemed dying within me.   Presently in looking back, my
alarm was redoubled, for I could see lights moving about in every direction:
my escape had evidently been discovered, and I so near them still. In
hopeless despair I threw myself upon the ground at the foot of Tybourne
Tree, and prayed to die before they should approach and find me.
Nearer and nearer some of them came-then all the lights seemed to
recede again towards the spot whence they had started-all but one,
and that one came on, and on, slowly, but steadily towards the very spot
on which I lay. I thought at that moment I should have gone mad
with fright, when suddenly I heard my name called in a feeble voice--
Anne, Anne, if you hear me, answer; I would save you.' So suddenly
had hope again revived, that for a moment I could not utter a word;
at last, rising upon my knees, I called as loudly as I could-' Grandfather, grandfather, I am here-here,' for it was my only friend, it
was the poor old man who had always been so kind to me. ' Heaven
be thanked,' he exclaimed, 'that it is I who have found you! Had
Nan discovered you, I verily believe she would have beaten you to
death.  The moment your flight was detected, I guessed at once that you
had overheard the very conversation, which I myself had been secretly
listening to; feeling that now you knew the truth, there was but one
direction you were likely to pursue, I started as swiftly as my wornout limbs would bear me, straight into the road to London. But you must
not lose a moment; yonder lies your way; here is a little money;' and
the poor old man put a few pence into my hand. 'Up child, up and
away,' he said, assisting me to rise. I was now forced to tell him
how impossible it was for me to proceed further.  ' Then you are lost,'
he said, ' for Nan will not give up the hunt so easily ; I know her too
well for that.  Yet there is a hope still-this tree.' It was Tybourne
Tree, a hopeless tree to most, but to me it was my all. I understood
him in a moment.  He took me in his arms, and as he helped me to his
shoulder, he kissed me, and calling upon Heaven to bless my ways,
hoped, for my sake, we might never meet again. I felt the tears fall
from the poor old man's eyes. I returned his kiss; then standing upon
his shoulders, as he supported himself against the trunk of the tree, I
exerted all the strength I had, and at last succeeded in reaching the
thickly-shading branches. 'On your life,' said the old man, 'stir not
until daylight shall show you that we have left the place. God bless
you, child! and sometimes think of your poor old friend-pray for him,








                                          <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>

for he needs your prayers. Bless thee, child, bless thee! Heaven be thy
guard this night !'
 </p><p> " I could not bid him good by. I saw by the wavering of his lantern
how tottering were his steps; more than once too, I saw him raise his
hand and pass it across his eyes; he hurried on, and I was left alone;
when he was quite gone, I endeavoured to ascend still higher into the
tree-the branches were thick and easy to mount, and I almost felt secure.
I had not been there any great length of time, when I was nearly falling
to the ground from alarm, for two horsemen came from the Edgeware
Road, and stopping beneath the tree, revealed to me by their voices that
they were the Clipper and another of the troop. I held my breath with
fear. I strained my nerves to hold my limbs from trembling, lest the
shaking of the boughs should attract their notice-they would doubtless
have thought it the wind, but you can little imagine, unless in such a
situation, what strange fancies fear will raise up in the mind. Presently
they moved on slowly towards our camp, and I felt for a moment relieved
and safe; but I was doomed to be yet more alarmed than ever, for ere
long I heard the horses' bells, the heavy rumble of the wheels, and soon
was made sensible that our whole company was journeying towards
the place of my concealment.    The line of vans, and carts, and
trampers, passed round close beneath the tree-I could hear their voices
-and between the leaves could just discern the various parties as they
passed. When I thought they had all gone, there was one still loitering
behind; it was the old man; I saw him turn his face up towards where
I lay concealed-I heard him whisper another blessing-and then again
move slowly on.
 </p><p> " I cannot describe to you all the feelings that passed through my
mind that night.  I knew  not whether hope or fear were stronger.
At last the daylight began to cast its gray tint all around.  I crept
lower down, and finding that no human being was near, I ventured to
descend to the earth. I tore off part of my dress, and tied the pieces
round my feet; this relieved them greatly, and remembering that as we
came along the road I had seen a lonely public, I managed, in time,
to reach it; the pence the old man had given me, procured for me food,
and permission to lie upon some straw in the loft of the stable. Here
I slept nearly the whole day-when night again came on I once more
began my journey; it seemed endless; every step I took appeared to
steal away my nerves; and oh, can I ever forget the painful joy that
burst upon my heart, as I first beheld our dear Old London Bridge.
So worn out had I become, from anxiety and fear lest I might never
reach my home again, that when I stood before the door, I could not
raise my hand to knock, nor my voice to cry for help.  I felt sick and
dizzy, all strength deserted my limbs, and I fell at the threshold of my
longed-for home. The rest you know.  Oh, mother, father! I am so
happy,'that I feel I could die with joy."
 </p><p> As she said this, she again threw her arms around the neck of her
parents, and hugged and kissed every one present, the Bridge shooter
not excepted.
 </p><p> The merchant now began to consider the best course to pursue, in
order, if possible, to bring justice home to those who had been guilty of







<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>                   .

stealing the child.  From what Anne had said, both the merchant and
Osborne no longer doubted but that the Clipper was the man whom
Edward had at first suspected him to be-namely, one of the three
wretches of the marsh; this gave them a further incentive for exertion,
and it was settled that not a moment should be lost in obtaining the
necessary powers to bring Nan and her paramour to punishment.
 </p><p> "Master," said the Bridge-shooter, who had been very thoughtful for
some time, "if I might venture to give an opinion, I should say
that where there is a jackal, there is most likely a lion skulking not far
behind."
 </p><p> "What mean you," said the merchant, " by such a figure of speech ?"
  </p><p>" What I means- mean, I mean," replied the Bridge-shooter,
correcting himself, and at the same time giving a sly look at Flora, as
much as to say, "come, you have not caught me tripping this time-I was
rather too quick for you there ;" then continuing, he said, " what I mean
is, that there's more in all this trying first to kill Edward, and then robbing
you of your child, and then so many thieves coming climbing up to that
-you know what I mean-than one would at first think, and so mother
thinks, and we've often talked about it; and depend upon it, though
she's no witch, she's no fool; I mean, sometimes, and it's she who says
the woman was the jackal, and we shall one day find the lion in his den
not far off: but says she, 'if ever Mistress Anne should be recovered,
let Master Hewet guard her well, for those who have done the wrong
once, won't be slow in repeating it if they can."
 </p><p> There is some reason in what you say," replied the merchant, " and
indeed I had already determined to keep the whole affair a secret, at
least for the present, in order to throw the perpetrators of the crime off
their guard, and  -"
 </p><p> The whole party were here made to start up, for through the open
casement flew something that fell clattering upon the table.
 </p><p> " Gracious ! what's that ?" exclaimed Flora, after a good scream; then
picking up the cause of her alarm, she said, " why, bless me, it's a stone,
and round it is tied a paper, and see, there's writing upon it."
  </p><p> The merchant took it from Flora, and untying the string, found the
paper was directed to Edward; the writing was in a female hand, and thus
it ran :-" The moment you have received this, hurry with all speed to
the Southwark end of the Bridge; as you quit the gateway, say, as if to
yourself, ' who can have sent it ?' the answer you will receive, will at
once convince you that nothing but good is intended: take no notice of
the speaker, be whom it may, but follow : I dare not say more; many
lives depend upon your speed."
 </p><p> The attempt on the marshes, at once recurred to all present, for that
had been brought about by an anonymous communication ; so to be on
the safe side, it was at once determined not to notice this mysterious
summons in any way.
 </p><p> The merchant being sent for to his shop descended, telling the Bridge-
shooter to go to the barber-surgeon, that he might attend to Edward's
wound.   In due course the barber arrived, dressed the cut, which he
declared, owing to his infillable balsam, would be perfectly healed by the
next day.








                                           <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>

  </p><p> As all the parties had gone about their various concerns, it was unnoticed for a long time that the Bridge-shooter had not returned.
Poor Flora was the first to remark the circumstance, and by degrees
became quite alarmed, for William never went any where without it
being known to her; she at last found it impossible to keep from the
window, where she remained straining her eyes first up the Bridge, then
down the Bridge, but still no William could she see. Presently she
exclaimed, " Oh, yes, here he comes, and running like a King's hound-
what can it mean ?"  She flew to meet him.
 </p><p>  " Where's our master ?" enquired William, as he entered the house,
quite out of breath.
  </p><p> " In yonder room," said Flora; " but what is the matter ?"
</p><p>   The Bridge-shooter, as he hurried to the room behind the shop, replied,
" Something that may turn to a serious matter for us all."
</p><p>  When the Bridge-shooter entered the back room he was glad to find
Edward with the merchant, so closing the door, that the men in the shop
might not hear what he said, " Master !" he exclaimed, " you have not
a moment to lose, you must fly."
</p><p>  " What mean you ?" ejaculated both the merchant and Edward, at the
same moment.
 </p><p> " I mean what I say. In two hours from this time it may be too late.
In a few words I can tell you all. You must know that when I had
been to Pole-squeeze, the surgeon, my curiosity was such that I could not
resist going to the Southwark gate, just to see if any suspicious-looking
person were lurking about; the only soul I saw was a poor nun begging,
as there is at the corner of every street and lane now.  But though
there was nobody else, I thought I'd try what charm there was in the
words Edward was told to repeat there, so I said, ' Who can have sent
it '  The words were scarcely out of my mouth, before the old nun
walking past me said softly, ' The Cripple !' she said no more, but at
once moved off. I stood for a moment doubtful what to do; but thinking
that if the summons really came from the Cripple, there was surely no
harm intended, but perhaps much good, I boldly started off after her. I
kept at a good distance, but I saw that at every corner she peeped slily
round to see that I was on her track.  And now where, of all places in
the world, think you she led me to ?" William did not wait for an answer
to his query, but said-" the very spot where Anne was taken-the
black arch of the Clink !"
  </p><p>"Good Heavens!" said the merchant, " are those wretches there
again ?"
 </p><p> " You shall hear," replied William and then went on. Before we arrived there, I began to look suspiciously about, for I liked not the quarters
we were in, and when she pushed open the door immediately under the
black arch, and entered, I made a dead stop, and was about to let my
heels save my throat, for I feared some treachery.  ' Do you not know
me ?' said the nun; ' have you forgotten the Abbess of St. Clair ?' She
threw back her hood, and then I saw it was she.
 </p><p> "Eoline and her husband are here,' she said; 'ascend; you'll find them
above; you will be as welcome as Edward would have been.' I groped







<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>                   .

my way up the ruined staircase, and there sure enough, in the room above
the archway, I found the Cripple of the Bridge seated on the floor,
supporting his blind wife in his arms-she was ill, and appeared almost
dying-not a bit of furniture was in the wretched place; no bed, no
couch, not even a stool. ' Why did not Edward come?' said the Cripple,
' I would have done as much for him.' I told him of your hurt, and
also of our doubting whether to notice the summons or not, for no name
being written, we all feared it was the scheming of an enemy, not the
wishes of a friend.  I enquired why he was there.  'Better to be here
and starve, than burning in the flames of Smithfield.  I forgot, dear
child,' he said, addressing Eoline, who clung closer to him as he spoke of
the fire, ' I forgot thee, dear one; but fear not, we are both safe here, if
Edward, or William, have courage to befriend a heretic ' He then told
me, what in a degree we already know, that ever since his marriage
with Eoline, Horton has been employing every artful scheme to bring
about his destruction, and now, as a last effort, he has accused him of
heresy, and of what in these days is worse, the denial of the king's
supremacy.  'But for the poor Abbess of St. Clair,' said the Cripple, ' I
had ere this have died upon the rack, for if once there, Horton will never
let me leave it but through the gates of death.  Were I dead, Eoline
would be completely in his power, and that is all he aims at."
 </p><p> "The fiend !" exclaimed the merchant; "were it but for the sake of
Eoline, I will save them both-to her I owe the life of my own dear
Alyce-but for Eoline, the burning ruins of the convent had been her
grave."
 </p><p> "Alas, master !" rejoined the Bridge-shooter, " I fear me much, that
all your power will be required to save yourself; the man now serving
Horton, was once a dependant of the Abbess; he owed her a deep debt
of gratitude, and knowing somewhat of the great interest she takes in all
that concerns the blind beauty of the Minories, he secretly divulged to
her the designs of Horton, not only regarding the intended destruction
of the Cripple, but also of a warrant of suspicion issued against you and
yours.  In two hours Horton himself, with his minions, will be here to
search the house for unlawful and heretical books."
</p><p>  "Horton !" exclaimed the merchant, "he dare not approach this roof;
but I will beard the villian, and  -"
 </p><p> " Not for worlds !" interrupted the Bridge-shooter: "no, no; in
these times a word may undo a man, and bring him to the flames. The
Cripple, who seems to know more than he chooses to divulge, has advised,
and his advice I am sure is best-particularly as it is your plan to keep the
restoration of your daughter for a time a secret; for her sake, for your
own, and for that of one who is more than all to you, your adored wife
yes, he advises that you should secretly leave this place, taking with-
you your wife and child. All is prepared; even the tide favours your
flight; it is now at the drain, so beneath the Bridge I have stationed a
covered barge, but light as a feather, with six right honest Southwark
lads, that I have known for many a day, and could trust my life with-
they will make the barge fly like an arrow through the flood. That
even the neighbours may not be aware of your departure, I have thought
of a plan by which you may leave your house unseen by any.  The








                               <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>

   next house, the Cardinal's Hat, will be closed till noon: I have sent the old
 woman who has the care of it, and who has been dreaming all night of
 money-bags, and gold, and such stuff, on a fortune-telling scheme up to
 my old mother; and while she is gone I promised to act the warder.
 I can open the trap-door on the roof-by that you can enter, and then
 descending to the lower room, by the flight of steps that is there, reach
 the sterling, and embark safely and secretly."
 The merchant paused for a moment ere he answered this strange, this
 unexpected proposition; when suddenly starting up he exclaimed--" It
 shall be so, for such a scheme will tally well with the plans I have now
idetermined on. Edward and you will guard all here-and for the sake
of Eoline, to whom I owe so much, I charge you neglect not to look to
her immediate welfare; consult with the Cripple, and without telling
him 'whence comes the aid, spare not my resources to save them."
As not a moment was to be lost, the reader may imagine the bustle
and excitement which now took place. Flora was here, there, and everywhere, and had not the sense of William checked her, she would have
collected together nearly the whole contents of the house; for like
most ladies when they are about to go a journey, if but for two days-
she kept saying--"But that's a thing we can't do without."   But
although poor Flora said it was impossible to do without this thing, and
that thing, and t'other thing, when they did leave the place, she found
herself in the possession of scarcely anything but what she stood upright
in. When all was prepared, Hewet placed a heavy purse of gold in
Edward's hand, bidding him employ it as he might best judge, according
to circumstances as they arose.
</p><p>Anne was the cleverest of all; her recent education had given her a
great superiority over every one there, in the art of making shift with,
or without almost anything.
 </p><p>  They ascended to the roof of their own dwelling, and easily passing
through that of the Cardinal's Hat soon found themselves in the lower
room. The Bridge-shooter lifted the trap-door, the very same through
which Horton had entered the place, in the beginning of our tale, and
carefully, with the aid of the merchant, succeeded in placing the three
females safely beneath the canopy of the barge; the merchant, as he
placed his foot upon the boat, whispered something in the ear of Edward,
and then entered the bark.
 </p><p>  The tide had by this time turned, and the now gentle fall, caused by
the rising of the waters, seemed like the childhood of the cataract, that a
few more hours' growth would bring to dread maturity.
  </p><p> The six Southwark lads, the moment the boat had drifted from beneath
the Bridge, lowered their oars with one dash into the flood, and then like
giants straining every nerve, made the frail bark quiver, as each stroke
bore them in triumph o'er the silver flood.
  </p><p> The moment the boat was gone, Edward and the Bridge-shooter
 returned to their own abode, and immediately began to make arrangements for the comfort of the Cripple and the blind Eoline.
  </p><p> "The first thing," said the Bridge-shooter, " that the poor souls want,
 is a bed of some sort, for the hard boards make but a sorry couch for a
 dying girl to lie on, and Eoline, I fear me, is dying."







<pb id="p.190" n="190"/>                      .

 </p><p> " True," replied Edward, " and the one that can be best spared, is
that on which I last night slept, in Horton's old room. Make it up in
the shape of a bale of cloth, and then no one will wonder at your load."
 </p><p> Not many minutes had elapsed after this arrangement, before the
Bridge-shooter might have been seen, carrying a huge bale from his
master's shop, and wending his way towards Southwark.
 </p><p> He had not been gone an hour before great excitement was caused,
not only in the merchant's shop, but in all that part of the Bridge where
Hewet resided, for it was soon bruited from door to door, that officers
belonging to the ecclesiastical courts of enquiry had taken possession of
the Golden Fleece; and that Horton, who was so well known as being
the unscrupulous tool of Cromwell, was come to ferret out heresy, if such
a wicked thing could there be found.
 </p><p> When Horton entered, he acted as though he had never seen Edward
in all his life before. "Where is your master ?" he inquired, in a tone
of insolent authority.
 </p><p> Edward was for a moment almost thrown off his guard, for he had not
yet arranged any excuse that was likely to be received as a good and
sufficient reason for the absence of his master-" Gone", he said, " gone-
I know my place too well, to be inquisitive about the movements of the
good merchant; he may have gone, and very likely has, to Flanders, for
he has a high commission from the King to fulfil, connected with his
Grace's intended marriage with the Princess Anne of Cleves."
</p><p>  " Indeed !" replied Horton; and then addressing the officers who accompanied him-" Let not this young man stir from the spot he is in,
while I with the searchers commence our duties."
 </p><p> The cause of Horton procuring the warrants of search may easily
be guessed at, when we find that the first room he entered was not with
the officials, but alone; it was his own old dormitory. The moment
he cast his eyes around it-" The furies seize them, I am foiled !" he
exclaimed, for he saw at once that all he cared to find was gone; it was
the bed, in which was secreted the costly diamond, and those deeds that
alone could bring Eoline her rights.  Hoping that it might still be found
in some other room, he flew over the whole house, the ways of which he
knew so well, but failing to discover the lost treasure, he descended to
the room in which Edward sat, still guarded; and changing his whole
behaviour in the hopes of discovering in what way the old mattress had
been disposed of, he ordered his men to leave the place; then turning
to his former brother apprentice, he said smilingly, " Edward, I suppose
you scarcely knew me when I first came in, for times have wonderfully
changed with me since last I entered this abode; and the most painful
part of that great change lies in the necessity arising out of my official
duties, which compel me to appear harsh and ungrateful to my oldest and
dearest friends. I need not tell you how happy I feel, at finding nothing
of a dangerous nature here; I have but slightly searched, for I knew it
would be so; but yet I was obliged to appear to those about me, that
even to such old friends as our good master and yourself, I would shew
no undue favour."
 </p><p> Edward felt so disgusted with what he knew to be hypocrisy, that he
disdained to make reply.







                                             <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>

   </p><p> Horton, who felt this coldness, but not having yet gained his end,
would not shew he did so, continued-" Why, Edward, you are lame;
no serious accident, I trust ?"
</p><p>" A mere slight cut," replied Edward; "I slept last night in your old
  room; a thief attempted to enter by the window."
 </p><p>   " Last night ?" exclaimed Horton, with unfeigned surprise.
 </p><p>   " Yes," replied Edward; " but he will not trouble us again, for I
  suspect I shot him through the brain, and as I ran towards the little
  casement, I cut my foot against something sharp, which, upon examination turned out to be a piece of knife that was sticking in the floor, and
  that seemed stained with blood."
  </p><p>  Horton turned away, as he felt his own blood flying from his face, for
  at that instant every dreadful act that had occurred in that room, flew on
  the wings of conscience, like a dagger into his heart.
   </p><p> " I was fortunately well provided with arms, for you see we have
  made that room our armory."
 </p><p> "Yes," said Horton, recovering himself, " you have greatly changed
the place, even the old bed is gone; it was a great favourite of mine;
  I passed many a happy night upon it; where is it now ?"
  </p><p>  This was a very awkward question for Edward to answer; but before
he could make a reply, the Bridge-shooter entered.
  </p><p>  "Have you left the bale as directed ?" enquired Osborne, with a look
of meaning, as he glanced towards Horton.
   </p><p> "Yes, Master Edward," replied William, "and it arrived just in
time."
  </p><p>  Horton continued, not deigning to notice the Bridge-shooter--" Yes,
 would not mind a trifle to obtain that old memento of my happiest
 days:" here he put on a very sentimental look.
 </p><p>   Edward, again giving William a peculiar glance, said, "Master Horton
 is enquiring after the bed that used to be in his little room below."
  </p><p>  "Oh!" said the Bridge-shooter, "that has been burnt I don't know
 how long-indeed I can't tell when. You see, that superstitious people
 sometimes don't fancy using a bed again on which a murdered body has
 been placed, so after Sir Filbut--"
   </p><p> " Pshaw" ejaculated Horton rising, but his lips were white and
quivering, notwithstanding his efforts to appear unconcerned-- ' Pshaw !
if the thing be burnt, why, there's an end of it; and I hardly know why
I lost my breath in enquiring about it at all. Osborne, when you communicate with our good master, for I still love to call him such, tell him as
gently as you may of this my visit; necessity of duty alone impelled it,
but if I can, for his good sake, prevent a further examination into the
reports that now are current against him, he may depend upon all my
power to shield him."  Saying this, Horton with his crew departed from
the Bridge.
   </p><p> We must now, for an instant, take a glance at the black arch of the
 Clink, for here a strange incident occurred, a few nights after the day
 of which we have  been writing. The reader has already been informed
 that close to the black arch there stood three old dilapidated dwellings;
 in that over the archway, the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-tower, but now
 the guardian of that tower and its ghastly heads no longer, had








<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>                   .

taken refuge; the other two, when he first took up his abode in
that locality, so dangerous to the honest, so safe for the rogue, were
empty.  The night after he had arrived, as he sat watching the sleeping
form of his beloved Eoline, as she lay in a feverish slumber, he thought
he heard the sound of voices in the street, or lane below; he peeped from
the window, whence he perceived a man and woman with a lantern
ascending the large flight of steps before mentioned; they entered the
house, and all was still and dark.  Two nights after this, the moon had
risen with unusual splendour, and in consequence of the aid, stealthily
but kindly sent from Edward by the Bridge-shooter, Eoline had so
rallied that she with her darling husband was at the casement. He was
endeavouring to explain to her the idea of moonlight. The poor Cripple
was just about to give up the hopeless task, when suddenly he checked
his speech, for Eoline, clinging fearfully to his arm, whispered, " Hush,
my soul's love, hush-there are footsteps near!"
  </p><p>The Cripple listened, but no sound could he distinguish.
 </p><p> " Yes, yes," she said, " there are, six-seven--eight feet moving;
four of them fall heavier upon the earth than do the others."
  </p><p>The Cripple who, from experience, knew how seldom the blind are
deceived regarding sounds, was dumb; presently he too felt convinced
that footsteps were approaching. He went to the head of the stairs, and
enquired softly of the Abbess, whether the door below was well secured;
this question alarming her, she rose from the couch upon which she had
lain down for the night, and ascended to their room, where, with the
Cripple, she watched from the casement, to learn if possible the reason
of the approaching sound; they feared they had been betrayed.
 </p><p> Presently they saw issuing from the arch beneath them four men; the
one who seemed the leader of the party appeared to have his head
covered with thick bandages of some sort; he was tall and heavily built;
the other three bore between them something that resembled the body of
a man. Not a word was spoken, but the tall man, who ever and anon
placed one hand to his head as if suffering from pain, pointed his commands with the other
 </p><p> The three men raised their load upright, and it was then evident to
the Cripple that what they had brought was a dead body. At the foot
of the long flight of steps stood a massive, tall wooden post; to this they
tied the corse, in an upright position; the head fell deathlike upon the
shoulder; and now the Cripple could discern that from around the dead
man's neck hung down the two ends of a rope, as telling the fearful tale
of murder by strangulation. While the three men were thus employed,
the fourth, he with the bandaged head, was fumbling with an old key
in the rusty lock of the door of the house, opposite to that of the steps.
When the horrid work performing by the trio was ended, the tall man
approaching the dead body, gazed for a moment in its face-then laughed
aloud, and spitting at it, he with the other wretches entered the third
dwelling, and all again was still.

</p><p>NEVER had been seen such crowds of gaily-dressed Southwark lads,
and Southwark lasses--Southwark old men, and Southwark dames of
antique gait, as ran, or walked, or hobbled over Old London Bridge towards the city on the morning of the nineteenth of February <date value="1547">1547</date>.
 </p><p> By this date, the reader will perceive that our pen has used its plume
to good purpose; and, instead of merely running on as fast as hand
could drive it, it has actually flown-ay, flown over no less a space of
time than eight years, since the closing of our last chapter.
 </p><p>  But, before we enter upon the cause of all this gaiety of face and
fanciful attire-for, be it known, that every face was smiling, and every
dress was new, or newly turned or trimmed, or in some way adorned to
fit it for so joyful an occasion-we must, for a moment, reverse our
glass, and look back upon events which, although diminished to the eye
of the reader as it were to mere specks, may still possess some interest;
and, indeed, as connecting links in the chain of our romance, are absolutely necessary to be regarded, if but for a moment.
  </p><p> During these eight years extraordinary changes had taken place, not
only in the characters of our tale, but in the historical transactions of
our land. Cromwell, as the reader may remember, had fondly hugged
himself upon his success in bringing about the marriage of Henry with
the protestant princess, Anne of Cleves; but this union was his ruin;
for, when Henry beheld her, which he did in the first instance secretly
and in disguise, he was so overcome by disappointment at her want, in
his eyes, of personal attraction, that it is said he had nearly fallen.
 </p><p>  We may easily picture to ourselves the agony Cromwell must have
endured upon being summoned into the presence of the king after he
had seen the wife his minister had provided him, and when he heard
the king's reply, upon his reminding his majesty that he had desired his
servants to find him "a fine large woman:" "Yes," said the king,
bitterly, "a fine large woman; but I did not tell you to bring me a
Flanders mare."
  </p><p> Great had been the exultation of Gardiner, the Roman Catholic
Bishop of Winchester, and all his adherents, at this signal failure on the
part of their enemy-Cromwell.
 </p><p>  Gardiner, who knew his master well, at once set to work; and, although matters had gone too far for him to prevent the marriage with
Anne of Cleves, he hoped soon to bring about a dissolution of that marriage, and to raise one of his own sect to be partaker of the throne.
The method he pursued was, to invite the king to his banquets, whereat
he placed near him, not a " Flanders mare"-not a " fine large woman;"
but one of the smallest, and at the same time, prettiest creatures in
England, Catherine Howard.








 <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>
  </p><p> Poor Henry, like a foolish moth, flew at once to the light which shone
from the brilliant eyes of the artful beauty, and again found the wings
of his heart most terribly singed.
  </p><p> Cromwell was now commanded to cause the same parliament, which
had no great length of time before, "prayed" the king to take to himself for a wife Anne of Cleves, now to "pray" of him to put her aside;
which these upright honest members of parliament accordingly did.
  </p><p> The Roman Catholics were now exulting at Cromwell's expected fall,
but had their hopes for a time greatly damped by finding the king not
only continue to trust his former favourite, but actually bestowing upon
him, with his own hands, the order of the garter, and then creating him
Earl of Essex.
 </p><p>  Henry, as in the case of his marriage with Anne Boleyn, wedded
Catherine Howard privately; and it is supposed, the marriage took place
on the very same day on which he ordered his faithful servant, Cromwell, to have his head struck off. This execution took place on Tower
Hill, on the twenty-eighth of July <date value="1540">1540</date>. Many a poor man's eye
dropped a tear to his memory; for twice a day were no less than two
hundred beggars fed at his door in Throgmorton Street.
 </p><p> The death of their patron caused Harry Horton, and his former coadjutor, Spikely, to fly beyond the seas; for they had been too active
against the Romanists to feel in safety now the tide seemed setting
against the Protestants, so that for some years we lose sight of them entirely.
</p><p>  In <date value="1541">1541</date>, Henry caused himself to be proclaimed King of Ireland,
thus becoming the first English king of that country.  Before this date,
his title was merely Lord of Ireland.
 </p><p> King Henry appeared to be particularly unfortunate in his numerous
matrimonial speculations; for we find pretty little Catherine Howard,
in February <date value="1542">1542</date>, undergoing the same fate on the same spot within the
walls of the tower, that had terminated the short and miserable regal
career of Anne Boleyn.
 </p><p> It seemed that neither a Romish wife, nor one of the Protestant faith, had
sufficient power over her bloodthirsty spouse, to make either side of the
balance waver a hair's breadth; for so nicely, as the historian says, did
he trim the scales, that if Dr. Barnes, a celebrated preacher and leader
of the Protestant party, " was committed to the torments of the merciless fire," and burnt alive in Smithfield, with Garret and Jerome, as a
heretic-in the other scale were to be found Powell, Abel, and Featherston, to be hanged and quartered for denying the king's supremacy.
If anything could be done to make these executions more revolting
to both sects, it was the fact of their being coupled-a Protestant with
a Catholic on the same hurdle-and thus drawn to the scene of death.
Upon this occasion, it is said that a Frenchman exclaimed, "Good
God ! how do people make a shift to live here, where Papists are hanged
and Anti-Papists are burnt ?"
</p><p>  We have, fortunately, but few more lines to write concerning the
monster, Henry the Eighth.
 </p><p> Some time before he died, he had married his sixth wife, Catherine
Parr, who miraculously escaped destruction, although often on its very







                <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>

brink.  Henry had now grown so enormously fat, that it is said he
could not pass through any ordinary door, and that machinery was employed, or numerous attendants called in, to aid him in moving from
room to room: so diseased had he become, that it was dangerous to
approach him. A law had been passed, making it treason, and several
persons had been executed, for even supposing the king's death; so that
at the last, when all around knew that he was dying, no one dared tell
him-the fatal truth. So determined did he appear to be, that even his
death-bed should be sprinkled with blood, that, perhaps the last act he
ever performed was sanctioning the execution of the Duke of Norfolk,
uncle of his second wife, Anne Boleyn, as well as of his fifth, Catherine
Howard. He was ordered for execution, but was saved by the king
dying a few hours before the time appointed for him to have laid his
head upon the block.
 </p><p> We will now look back upon the occurrences which took place in the
Clink, after the Cripple had witnessed the horrid scene of tying the dead
body to the post at the foot of the long flight of steps. His eyes seemed
riveted to the horrid spectre. What could be the meaning of such an
act ? He now began to feel the danger of his own position increasing a
hundredfold; for he knew full well, that if the body were found there by
the authorities, a searching investigation mightperhaps take place, and his
own concealment be betrayed. How should he act ? what could he do ?
The murderers he knew were close at hand; but even if he had the
power to denounce them, his own life, and that of one who was more to
him than life, would, at the same moment, be sacrificed. As he was
thus musing, "Hush!" again said Eoline, "there is another footstep
approaching. Should it be the watch, we are lost: oh, Heaven save us!"
 </p><p> The footstepbecame louder as it approached beneath the black arch. The
Cripple now saw plainly that the four men were watching from the
windows of the house they had entered. He was not long kept in suspense, for the scene which followed at once revealed the whole to him.
The person who issued from the archway was the same woman whom
he had seen with the lantern ascending the steps in company with a
man. As she approached the body, she suddenly started; then looking
closer-" Heavens and earth !" she said, "'tis the body of a man! what
can this mean ?" Then raising her lantern towards the face, she uttered a
shriek, and exclaimed with anguish, "'Tis he! 'tis he! they have murdered him !"  She again was made to start by hearing a shout of laughter behind her; and turning, she saw the four men: he with the bandaged
head exclaimed-" We have murdered him, your beautiful Ray, the
Clipper! And did you think your husband, because he did not shew his
teeth before he knew he could bite, never intended to open his mouth ?
Ha! ha! Spikely never yet remained unrevenged.   Bind her to the
same stake," he said, turning to the men; but before they could advance a foot, she had flown up the steps, entered the house, and secured
the door within.  When they found that she had given them the slip,
Spikely's rage became ungovernalle. He flew at the door like a bull;
but it resisted all his efforts to break it open. He then changed his
tone, and pretending to laugh, told her he meant her no harm; and that
if she would open the door, now he had been revenged on Ray the Clipper,








<pb id="p.196" n="196"/>                   .

 all should be forgiven and forgotten. He listened, but received no
reply. The Cripple now saw the woman come from the attic window, and
creeping along the gutters, pass over several ruinous houses; and then
turning round a corner, became hidden from view.
 </p><p> When Spikely had lost all patience at her obstinacy, as he called it,
in not opening the door, he began to swear; and vowed, that rather
than not reward her as she deserved, he'd fire the whole place, and burn
her like a rat. As he was saying this, a lad came hurrying from beneath the arch, and said something in a low quick tone which the Cripple could not distinguish; but, without a moment's delay, the body was
unfastened from the post, and as they conveyed it to the house whence
they had come, he fancied he heard one of the men say " they could
bury it in the cellar beneath the street."
</p><p>  Scarcely a minute had elapsed after they had disappeared before a
heavy tramping of feet was heard; and now the Cripple easily guessed
the cause of their precipitate retreat-it was the Watch, taking their
seldom-performed round.
 </p><p> The Cripple could not help reflecting what strange scenes are often
passing within a yard of us, that if we knew of would make our blood almost freeze in our veins. He dared not speak, and yet he saw the supposed
guardians of the laws unconsciously walking over the very spot beneath
which a murdered man was at that instant being buried by his assassins.
He felt as if he had been equally guilty with the actors in the deed,
because he held his peace. His eyes seemed to penetrate through the
earth, and look upon the bloody scene at that instant being enacted.
At one moment his lips actually moved to raise the alarm, but his eyes
falling upon the poor helpless creature at his side, he resisted the impulse and was dumb. The watch passed on; a short time sufficed for
the unhallowed sextons to fulfil their task, which, as he guessed, being
accomplished, the men again issued from the door; they carefully locked
it, and then silently disappeared beneath the black arch.
</p><p>  The next morning the Bridge-shooter brought the poor Cripple the
cheering news that Edward Osborne had prepared every thing for their
flight. One of his master's vessels was to sail that night for the Netherlands, and aboard which they would be conveyed to a land of safety.
It was settled that an hour before the moon should rise, a waggon should
be brought as close as safety would allow, to the black arch; that Eoline should be carried by the Bridge-shooter and the Cripple on the mattress as she lay, and being placed in the waggon, conveyed some distance on the road to Greenwich, where a boat would be in readiness to
bear them all to the merchant's vessel.
 </p><p> As the hour approached for carrying the scheme into execution, Edward and the Bridge-shooter were somewhat surprised by the Lord
Mayor appearing, mounted, in full harness; the Sheriffs too followed, and
behind them came some hundreds of armed men. The Southwark-gate
was closed; the towers were manned, as indeed were all the roofs of
the houses at that end of the Bridge. This warlike movement, which
was one of not infrequent occurrence, was now rendered necessary in
consequence of the report brought in by the watch which the Cripple had
seen the night before passing through the Clink.  It appeared that the








                                           <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>

 "Bishop of Winchester's birds," for that was the name by which the
 ruffians who, as it were, took sanctuary in the Clink or the Mint, were
 known, had fixed upon that night to make a foray into the city, for the
 purpose of robbery. Southwark and Lambeth had both, in former times,
 been the receptacles of the greater part of the vice and immorality of
 London. So little power had the Lord Mayor over this district, that,
 although to protect the city, he would, with his armed bands, watch for
 a whole night upon the Bridge, he seldom ventured to attack the thieves
 in their strong-hold. What a strange and lawless state of things does
 this picture present to view!
  </p><p> The one half of the Bridge being choked up with soldiers, and the
 gates closed, Edward and the Bridge-shooter were compelled to reach
 Southwark by a different route: fortunately their waggon had already
 passed over the Bridge; so, hurrying through the city to Paul's
 Wharf, they there took boat, and proceeded towards the opposite shore.
  </p><p> The night was gloomy; though not so dark but that they could see
quite enough to convince them that the " Bishop of Winchester's birds"
were not easily to be thwarted by any Lord Mayor, be he as cunning
as he might; for suddenly they found themselves surrounded by, at
least, fifty boats, all crowded with thieves.
 </p><p>  It was indeed a lucky thing for the safety of their project, as well as
their own, that the Bridge-shooter's early education had been attended
to by instructors not quite so respectable as Flora Gray, or they might
have been, in all probability, detained the whole night as prisoners; or,
perchance, robbed and murdered outright. More than a dozen times
were they called to in a manner, that, had Edward been alone, would
have proved unanswerable-at least by him.
</p><p>  " Fish or fowl ?" was the invariable question; to which the Bridge-
shooter, imitating his former vulgar tone of voice, replied--" Birds all!
birds all!"
 </p><p> "What can this mean ?" said Osborne in a whisper to William.
 </p><p> " You'll know to-morrow, Master Edward, depend upon that," said
the Bridge-shooter. "How this does remind one of old times, to be
sure. When I was a boy, I had no idea of there being any harm
in it."
 </p><p> ' In what ?" enquired Osborne.
 </p><p> " Vy, you see-- lord love me! if these beauties have not made me
forget all my gentility-did you hear my V ?  I'm glad Flora was not
here. Why, you see, Master Edward, that every one of these boats is
filled with thieves, who, finding their scheme upon London has been
blown, are now on their way, while the Lord Mayor is dozing on the
Bridge, just to go and open the eyes of the good folk of Westminster:
it's an old trick, but one that seldom fails: you'll hear of five hundred
robberies to-morrow, and many a Bird now chirping here, will be hung
up with his feathers on before the week's out: but what of that ? they're
so used to it, that if nine out of every ten fly off without their throats
getting the squeeze, they're as merry as larks."
The boats of their disreputable neighbours having left the way clear,
they soon effected a safe landing, and by the aid of the Bridge-shooter's
local knowledge, were in a few minutes at the door beneath the black








<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>                    .

arch. So much beyond the appointed time had been their arrival, that
the Cripple of the Bridge had nearly exhausted all the excuses he could
invent to appease the fears of Eoline, or as likely to have been the cause
of his friend's delay, when all alarm was set at rest by Osborne's entrance.
  </p><p> All had long been in readiness in that wretched abode.  The poor
Abbess had put on every piece of clothing she possessed, as being the
easier mode of carrying her now scanty wardrobe. Eoline had been
already brought from the room above, and was lying upon the mattress,
warmly wrapped in one of Merchant Hewet's furred gowns, which Edward had sent for the purpose.
  </p><p> There being no reason for delay, but every reason for immediate flight,
Eoline as she lay, was borne between them, and thus they left the place.
As they came out, the Bridge-shooter pointing to the house with the
steps, whispered to Edward, " that is the place-it was up those horrid
steps poor Anne was dragged, the night she was lost."
  </p><p> Osborne would gladly have waited a few moments to have examined
the spot more minutely, but as the moon began to send forth her feeble
rays, to announce her near approach, it was more prudent to push onwards
as speedily as possible. Not far from the arch they found the expected
waggon, and now all were fairly on their way; everything turned out
propitiously; and in an hour more, the Cripple with his Eoline and the
Abbess were safely on board the good merchant's vessel; the anchor was
weighed, the sails were set, and Eoline dropping tears of gratitude from
her poor sightless eyes upon the hand of Osborne, as she fervently pressed
it to her lips, breathed a heartfelt prayer for him and all he might ever
love. A minute more, and the last ' God speed you" was heard, and
the vessel began to move majestically upon its dangerous course.
  </p><p> While these incidents were performing, Master Hewet, with his Alyce
and his newly-found daughter, the lovely Anne, and Flora Gray, had
arrived safely at Putney.  Here, by the assistance of old Cromwell, he
was at once enabled to settle in a most beautiful retreat, and taking the
name of Allen, the better to throw his enemies off the scent, he began
to lay out his plans for the future happiness of those dependent upon him.
Innocent as he knew himself to have ever been regarding his religious
views, still, even the accusation of heresy, in such times, was a thing
not to be regarded with indifference; it was, therefore, with infinite satisfaction he heard Edward Osborne's account of the interview he had
had with Horton.
 </p><p> His principal anxiety now became to discover, if possible, some clue to
the secret enmity, which evidently was ever on the watch to injure him.
The exertions he had made, had been the cause of the celebrated monster
show dissolvingofitself; its elements were scattered here, there, and everywhere. Nothing could be heard of Nan, nor the Clipper, nor of one whom
lie would most kindly have protected, and have rewarded munificently-
the old man who had befriended his child. As there had been an educational establishment settled close at hand,the governants of which, formerly
nuns, but who had ever born a character of high repute, not only for virtue
and sanctity, but for great learning, he immediately determined to continue
his wife and child where they were, until Anne had finished her education;







                              <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>

and he was the more inclined to this arrangement, for he had every
wish that the strange incidents of Anne's late way of life, should be, if
possible, buried in oblivion.
</p><p>The next few years, proved to the merchant one uninterrupted course
  of prosperity and happiness.  Alyce's mind, day by day, became more
  fixed, and had indeed so apparently returned to its former tone, that
  unless it were shaken by touching upon one certain string, no indication
  of weakness would at all appear: there was another reason for the
  merchant not wishing to take his dear Alyce again to the Bridge, and
  that was, the fact of the ci-devant saintly Father Brassinjaw, having
  become the landlord of the next house, the Cardinal's Hat.  It is true,
  that Alyce might not have recognised her former confessor, now he had
  let his hair and whiskers grow, but she never could have gone to her
  window without her eyes being shocked by the sight of his well-known,
  but dreaded name; for he had most ostentatiously proclaimed his new
  calling, by having painted, in enormous letters, under the sign of the
  Cardinal's Hat, "BRASSINJAW, VINTNER;" to which was appended this exquisite distich:-
   </p><p>                    <quote rend="blockquote"><l>   " Come, come,
                          And taste my stum !"</l></quote>
 </p><p> Every Saturday afternoon, Edward and the Bridge-shooter rowed their
master, in a beautiful light barge he had had built on purpose, up to the
cottage of the heath-that is to say, to the ferry-for the cottage stood
at some distance inland. Here they were always met by Dame Allen,
as Alyce was now called, with her daughter and Flora, and never were
six more happy countenances to be met with, than those that now smiled
upon each other.
</p><p>As they strolled homewards, the party invariably divided into three
couples, admirably assorted.  The merchant, with his wife's arm through
his own, took the lead; then followed Edward and Anne, and last-
  at much greater-distance thanthe other four kept apart-followed William
  and Flora.  Notwithstanding the distance they were away, those before
  them more than once had heard Flora exclaim, "Don't he a fool,
  William, you'll make me cross if you do that again."  What William
  had been doing, or attempting to do, upon such occasions, has never been
  divulged, so we must be excused for not recording it.
  Early on the Monday mornings, the same little party were again seen
  on the same spot, their faces beaming with equal kindness, but lacking
  slightly the joyousness of the Saturday at eve, for now it was the
  merchant that followed his two trusty serviteurs into the barge; and
  each, and all, having bade adieu, was once more on his way to Old
  London Bridge.
 </p><p> The three females always remained on the shore, watching the receding
  bark, until a bend in the river was about to hide it from their view; at
  this point the merchant invariably stood up in the boat, and waved his cap
  to those whom he had left.  Edward and the Bridge-shooter took their
  oars from the flood, and raising them upright, moved them in the air as
  token of a last adieu; three scarves were now seen waving from the
  shore; the oars again descended to the flood, and they were gone.</p>

  <pb id="p.200" n="200"/>

  <p>Alyce then went upon her visits of charity; Anne to her studies; and Flora to think, we fear, much more of the Bridge-shooter than of her household affairs.
  </p><p>Have now explained how matters had sped during the years gone by, we will take up the thread
  of our narratibe from the nineteenth of
  Febrruary, 1547, far as we ahve before said, at the epoch we have now arrived.</p>

 <p>Yes, yes, merry and mad, and mad indeed , and merry, were the crowds
 that passed over Old London Bridge on the nineteenth of February, 1547.
 Was it because the great bell had already tolled the funeral knell  of the
 tyrant, King Henry the Eighth, and thus gave hope that the flames of
 Smithfield would at once be quenched ; and that ropes which had so long been
 used to hang up men, might now be made into bell-pulls, to ring
 out merry peals withal ?</p>
<p> This feeling no doubt had its weight with many minds, and might be
 said to be the first cause of the apparent jollity, for the death of Henry had
 placed another upon the throne, and that other was upon the morrow to be
 crowned. Yes, Edward the Sixth, although a boy scarcely past his ninth year of
 age, was now Ling of England.</p>
<p>  The coronation  being fixed for the twentieth of February, it was
arranged that on the nineteenth, the day we are writing about, Edward
should pass in grand procession from the Tower, through the city of
London, and sleep that night in his city of Westminster, preparatory to
his coronation in Westminster Abbey on the he following day. It was to
enjoy the magnificence of this procession, that the worthy citizens were
all astir betimes; and to do full honour to the young king, every scrap
of finery they could lay hands on was brought into requisition, and most
ostentatiously displayed , either on their own backs , or upon the
fronts of their own houses.</p>
<p>The roads, throughout the whole line of procession , were soon after
break of day being rendered bright and smooth, by hundreds of waggonloads
of fine gravel arriving from the country, and being strewn over the ground.</p>
<p>Busy indeed had been the carious handicrafts during the whole night;
some building up scaffolding before the houses, other decorating those
already built; windows were being removed, and soft cushions placed
on the sills, from which hung out, down the fronts of the dwellings, cloths
of the gayest colours; whilst the richer citizens decked their housed from
top to bottom with cloth of arras, gold, or silver. Evergreens were in endless profusion.

arrow-maker pretended, but it was mere pretence, that his nose had
been sharp enough to smell out a portion of the hidden wonder, but what

<p>From daybreak, which, this being February, was not very early - for
the goddess of the day being, like most people at this time of the year, rather
a sluggard, could not be tempted to upon her bright blue eyes, until the
clock had sounded no less than seven times since midnight - yes, from break of day, had Checklocke been anxiously watching from one of the three openings on the Bridge, for the arrival of some vessel. At last
turning triumphantly to his anxious friends , he exclaimed , "come along,
lads! come along, for now - you'll see."</p>
<p> The four at once left the Bridge, and hurried down to the Steel Yard
-the great wharf belonging to the foreign merchants, where all sorts
of things were landed or shipped, and where the government bought there
gunpowder, for as year that destructive article was not manufactured in
England; nor indeed were those dread instruments for its use - the iron -throated
cannon, yet made here. It was not until some time after Edward
came to the throne, that the first iron cannon was founded in this country, and that
was by a Frenchman, the English field ordinance being previously constructed of leather, or wood hooped round with iron.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Steel Yard, Checklocke's friends were still
kept  in as much doubt as ever. The people belonging to the wharf
were soon busy in harnessing some strong Flanders horses to a clumsy
four wheeled low sort of truck . By the  time this was done, a heavy
boat, or lighter, shot through the Bridge , and was soon after safely
secured to the wharf.  A part of the mystery was now solved; for,
from this boat the cranes began to slowly raise an enormous anchor,
which , being brought to a proper height, the crones were turned inwards;
the anchor began again to descend, and was soon resting safely upon the
truck.</p>
<p>"Come, Master Checklocke," said Catchemayde, rather pettishly,
"tell us, man, tell us at once what you are about! for what you can
possibly want to do with that huge anchor, I think would puzzle old
Sharp-nose there to divine: so divulge-divulge, friend Checke."</p>
<p>The only reply he received was, "You'll see;" which reply was, of
course once more echoed by the little arrow-maker.</p>
<p>Creak went the solid wheels-slash went the carters whip-a few long oaths were added to each cut; and the vehicle, with its mysterious load,
began to move away.</p>
<p> The place to which the anchor was taken, appeared to be about the

  <pb id="p.202" n="202"/>

last in England where one would have thought such a machine could
possibly be put to any use-this was St. Paul's Church--yard! Catchemayde became more pettish and cross at every step; and when they
had arrived just before the door of the dean's dwelling, he burst out in
a perfect rage--" He was not going to be treated so-he was not a child,
and he'd be d--d if he'd stand it."  Now, whether it was a punishment for his swearing, or a mere accident, we know not; but certainly
he suited the " action to the word;" for, instead of standing it, he fell
headlong into a large hole that had been dug close to the dean's door.
Out of this hole poor Catchemayde was soon dragged; and into that
hole the anchor was soon lowered, and embedded firmly in the earth.
  </p><p> For what purpose this emblem of hope had been there placed, the
reader, by and by, will be made acquainted.
  </p><p> Now began all over London, the ringing of bells; but the bells, to
hear which, crowds upon crowds were seen hurrying, were those of
Shoreditch: these bells long maintained their celebrity, and were such
great favourites with Queen Elizabeth, that she never passed them
without making a long halt to listen to their music-the people, all bareheaded, kneeling round her.
  </p><p> Few of our readers are, perhaps, aware of the sacred honours that
bells had, in our Roman Catholic times, conferred upon them. Can it
scarcely now be believed, that, before a bell could be hung up in a
steeple, it had to be first subjected to the holy rite of baptism ? But such
really was the case. The baptism was performed either by the bishop
or his deputy. Most of the forms prescribed for the baptism of a child,
were gone through in giving a name to the bell.
  </p><p>The bishop and priests washed it in water, anointed it in the name of
the Holy Trinity; it had Godfathers, who were persons of high rank.
Holy water, oil, salt, and cream were used, and tapers burnt. The
bell was crossed by the Bishop, and even more psalms were read at this
performance, than there were at the christening of an infant.
 </p><p> Bells were supposed to possess, after being duly christened, an
enormous power over evil spirits; also over the elements; thunder and
lightning were dreadfully afraid of bells: but the following prayer, which
was offered up for the bell, will let the reader understand at once what
was hoped and expected from it; thus ran the prayer:-
 </p><p> "Lord, grant that wheresoever this holy bell, thus washed and blessed,
shall sound, all deceits of Satan, all dangers of whirlwind, thunders,
lightnings, and tempests, may be driven away, and that devotion may
increase in Christian men when they hear it. 0 Lord, sanctify it by thy
Holy Spirit; that when it sounds in thy people's ears they may adore
Thee! May their faith and devotion increase, the devil be afraid, and
tremble, and fly, at the sound of it. O Lord, pour upon it thy heavenly
blessing! that the fiery darts of the devil may be made to fly backwards
at the sound thereof-that it may deliver from danger of wind and
thunder. And grant, Lord, that all that come to the church at the
sound of it, may be free from all temptations of the devil. O Lord,
infuse into it the heavenly dew of thy Holy Ghost, that the devil may
always fly away before the sound of it, &amp;c., &amp;c."
 </p><p> Henry the Eighth, appears to have had as little respect for holy







                                        <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

bells, as he had for the Pope, for we find that the four largest in
England, called Jesus's bells, which hung in the Clock-house near St.
Paul's, were staked by him against one hundred pounds, and lost to
Sir Miles Partridge, at a cast of dice.
  </p><p> We are not very much astonished at evil spirits, supposing them to have
ears, being frightened at the sound, for even now there are in the city
one or two peals of bells, that, when they ring their loudest all at once,
are enough to frighten old Nick himself.
  </p><p> But on the occasion we are recording, bad spirits were not even thought
of; oh, no! the ringings were to put people into good spirits, and merry
peals, indeed, now sounded from every steeple.
 </p><p>  The Shoreditch youths, for be it known that bell-ringers, like postboys, always retain their cognomen of juvenility, no matter what their
real age may be-yes, the Shoreditch youths, upon this occasion, were to
outdo all their former outdoings, and so they did, for they executed a
complete peal of grandsire triples!-yes, grandsire triples, in which
peal there were no less than five thousand and forty changes.
 </p><p>  We must confess we are happy that we were not there to hear them,
for, notwithstanding, that each of the eight old youths worked away like
a steam engine, the performance took three hours and six minutes.
 </p><p> The sound of cannon now boomed from the Tower walls; this was the
signal for all who were to participate in the gorgeous procession, to
hasten to their respective stations. The city crafts took their position
behind the rails before mentioned, and with their heads uncovered, stood
like so many statues awaiting the kingly spirit to come and conjure them
into moving beings. Their flat caps, for out of compliment to the young
King, who had always worn a cap of this description, the like of which
may be seen in these days, generally under the arms, not on the heads,
of our blue-coat boys, had been substituted for those of older fashion, and
now hung by a string on their backs like so many large muffins.
</p><p>  On the opposite side of the way were lines of priests and clerks, with
their crosses and censors; they wore their richest vestments, and splendid
indeed was the effect they produced. Streamers and banners floated in
the breeze, as they hung down from lines stretched across the streets.
 </p><p> Exactly at one of the clock, an enormous roaring of cannon was heard,
which told the anxious expectants that the procession had commenced.
Bands of trumpeters, and drum-slades, and indeed of almost every musical instrument then known, were placed at stated distances, so that as
the procession moved onwards, there was music heard throughout the
whole line.
</p><p>  First came the King's messengers, two and two; then followed bands of
gentlemen, and Ambassadors' retainers, all two and two. Next came
whole crowds of chaplains, but these were as yet without dignity; and
next to them, gaily prancing upon richly-caparisoned steeds, came the
sons of gentlemen and noblemen.  Then advanced the great Barons, all
arranged after their estate  The Bishops followed, attired in all their
gorgeous vestments; then the younger sons of Earls, Marquises, and
Dukes, succeeded by the Earls, Marquises and Dukes themselves. The
Comptroller of the household, with the secretary of Venice. The Treasurer of the King's house, with one of the Ambassadors of the Protestants.








<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>                  .

The King's Almoner, with another of the Ambassadors of the Protestants.
These were followed by Sir William Paget, Secretary of State, with
Duke Philip of Almaine. The Lord Admiral accompanied one of the
Scotch Ambassadors; the Lord Privy Seal another. The Lord Great
Master of the Household (Sir William Poulet, Lord St. John, soon after
Lord Chancellor, and subsequently the first Marquis of Winchester), did
honour to Poley, Baron de le Garde, of France.  The Lord Chancellor,
with the French King's Ambassador, and the Archbishop of Canterbury,
with the Emperor's Ambassador, came next; these were followed by Sir
Percival Hart, Knight Harbinger, bearing the King's cloak and hat. The
next that came were two Gentlemen Ushers, John Norrys, and William
Rainsford, representing the two estates of Normandy and Guienne,
clothed in robes of scarlet furred with minever, wearing caps of state on
their heads, and carrying about them, in baudrick-wise, two mantles of
scarlet velvet: Garter, in the king's coat of arms on the right hand, and
the Mayor of London carrying a mace, on the left. Sergeants at arms,
with their maces, going on either side of the way. Then followed the Lord
Marquis of Dorset, the Constable of England, bearing the sword; on his
right hand was the Earl of Warwick, Lord Great Chamberlain of England, and on his left, the Earl of Arundel, the Lord Chamberlain, supplying the room of Earl Marshal; in lieu of the Lord Protector, the Duke
of Somerset, who came next attending upon Edward.
 </p><p> The populace set up a shout of delight that rent the air: the incense was waving in every direction, and scenting the breeze with holy
perfume.
 </p><p> The King had now left the Tower Gate. In order that his loving
subjects might the better view  his person, he rode a step or two in
advance of the sumptuous square canopy. His Highness was richly
apparelled in a gown of cloth of silver, all over embroidered with damask
gold ; he wore a girdle of white velvet, wrought with Venice silver and
precious stones, such as rubies and diamonds, with true-love knots of
pearls, and a doublet of white velvet according to the same, embroidered
with Venice silver, and garnished in like manner with precious stones
and pearls; his cap and buskins were also of white velvet, and in like
manner adorned. His horse was caparisoned with crimson satin, richly
ornamented with pearls and damask gold. His Highness's footmen, in
rich coats, going about His Grace, on either side of the canopy, which
was borne by six knights, who had certain assistants really to bear the
load. Behind the King came Sir Anthony Brown, Master of the Horse,
leading a goodly courser of honour, very richly trapped.
  </p><p> Nine henchmen now came prancing on, mounted on sturdy steeds,
with saddles of state, riding bare-headed, and appareled in cassocks, parted
in the midst, one half cloth of gold, the other cloth of silver, and their
horses adorned with trappings of the same. Then Sir Francis Bryant,
master of the henchmen came riding alone; next the gentlemen and
grooms of the Privy Chamber, on horseback two and two; the pensioners and men at arms, with their pole-axes, going on either side
of the way, on foot, with their halberts in their hands.
 </p><p>  All the servants belonging to noblemen and gentlemen now followed
in order, after the degrees and estates of their masters.

   </p><p> As the King's Highness entered Mark Lane, a tremendous peal of
 ordnance was shot at the Tower. In Fenchurch Street, was a scaffolding,
 richly hung with cloth of arras, and therein divers singing men and
 children, singing and playing upon the regalls as the King's Highness
 came by.
  </p><p> At the Conduit on Cornhill was a pageant, hung and garnished with
 arras, whereon was put a proper conduit, which continually ran with
 sweet wine.   On the same pageant were divers instruments and goodly
 singing; and two children pronounced to the King's Highness two poetical
 Speeches; and then was sung the following stanzas, the God Save the
 King of those days:
  </p><p>            <quote rend="blockquote"><l>  King Edward, King Edward,
                </l><l>God save King Edward,

                </l><l>To have the sword,

   </l><l>His enemies to put down

   </l><l>Whom God preserve in peace and werre,
            </l><l>And safely keep from all danger.</l></quote>
</p><p>This song gave infinite delight to the public, who shouted the last
two lines in full chorus.
 </p><p> The boy-king was next greatly amused by two persons at the entrance
    the conduit in Cheap, representing the still well-known characters of
 Valentine and Orson.  The one was dressed in full harness, that is,
 armour; the other was entirely covered with moss.   These two worthies also addressed the king.  At the same conduit was a sumptuous
 fountain, upon which rested an imperial crown.   The whole was garnished with roses (we presume, artificial), and juliflowers.  From  this
 fountain descended through various pipes, sweet wine and claret, which
 man plenteously for six hours.
 </p><p>Ah, how busily employed had been the saintly Father, we mean,
 Master Brassinjaw, for the greater part of that long time!  What a
blessing for mine host of the Cardinal's Hat! At some little distance,
so that he might not attract too much notice, he had prepared large barrels upon wheels, and here he himself remained, while all the little boys
  could engage in his service by a few farthings and promises of pence,
were continually running from the fountain with pots of wine, which he
emptied into the said barrels; and then, with a virtuous exhortation to








<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>                  .

  the " little dears to be diligent," he sent the bearers with their empty
  jugs, back to the fountain.
   </p><p> The few persons who were remaining at home on the Bridge were
 astonished to see the enormous stock of wine Master Brassinjaw was
 laying in, never dreaming for a moment that the king's royal grace was
 the wine merchant with whom Brassinjaw was dealing so largely.
   </p><p> "Ah !" said Brassinjaw, as he chalked up another score, which meant
 another barrel, against the wall of the dark court wherein he had ensconced
 himself, " Ah ! by pretty St. Afra, but we have a king at last-a real
 king-a noble king-a virtuous king-a Protestant king !" or something
 like it.
  </p><p>  Poor Brassinjaw had actually slipped into protestantism, he knew not
 how, when, or wherefore; nor did he seem to think it worth the trouble
 of asking himself the question; but why he should have called upon
 the Romish Saint Afra at such a moment, it were difficult to divine,
 unless, indeed, he being a vintner, it was because she had been suffocated by the smoke from vine leaves.
  </p><p> St. Afra was an abandoned woman; but having refused to sacrifice
 to the heathen deities at Augsburg, in the time of Dioclesian, she,
 with several of her companions, were tied to a stake and destroyed by
 suffocation, as above stated.
  </p><p> Brassinjaw's exertions were for a time put a stop to by the approach
 of the King, who halted near this fountain to hear the short addresses
 from four children, richly adorned, representing Grace, Nature, Fortune,
 and Charity.  He then listened to others who personified Sapience, and
 the seven liberal Sciences-Grammar, Logic, Arithmetic, Rhetoric,
 Geometry, Music, and Astronomy.   A little further on was a most
 splendid dumb show, which is thus described-
 </p><p>  " A double scaffold was hung with cloth of gold and silk, besides rich
arras. In the upper stage was devised an element of heaven, with sun,
stars, and clouds, very naturally. From this part there was spread
abroad another lesser cloud of white sarcenet, fringed with silk, powdered with stars and beams of gold, out of which there descended a phoenix
down to the nether scaffold, where, sitting herself upon a mount, there
spread forth roses, white and red, juliflowers, and hawthorn boughs.
After the phoenix had been there a little, there approached a lion of
gold, crowned, making semblance of amity unto a bird, moving his head
sundry times; between the which familiarity, as it seemed, there came
forth a young lion, that had a crown imperial, brought from heaven
above, as by two angels, which they set upon his head. Then the old lion
and phoenix vanished away, leaving the young lion, being crowned, alone."
  </p><p> The king was told that this recondite device was to signify, by the
virtue of the lion, that he was descended lineally, through God's provision, and his divine power, to succeed Henry the Eighth, so that from
this we are to regard the phoenix as Jane Seymour, and the old lion,
bluff King Hal-we think an old bear would have been more appropriate. But the allegorical representation did not end here, for we find
that " the young monarch was himself personified in the lower scaffold, by a child apparelled with rich cloth of gold, and a robe of
crimson satin, and seated upon a throne, which was upheld by four








                                         <pb id="p.207" n="207"/>

other children, representing REGALITY, having a sceptre in his hand;
JUSTICE, with a sword; TRUTH, with a book; and MERCY, with a
'little curtain,' or pointless sword.
  </p><p> This was certainly an elegant and pretty device, and, as the four
children uttered good sense and good advice, this pageant might be approved, although most of these shows were nonsensical in the extreme.
 </p><p>  REGALITY, addressing the king, said, " Rule and govern prudently"-
then JUSTICE, taking the next turn, observed, "And do justice cordinly"-which was immediately followed by MERCY, saying " But mix
with mercy"-" that the truth may stand surely," said TRUTH, " and
your throne may endure permanently."
 </p><p>  It would be tedious to describe all the mummeries that were placed
in the road to solace the King's Highness-we will merely mention the
Golden Fleece, guarded by two bulls and a serpent, casting out flames
of fire from their mouths; so, the standard of Cheap, with the trumpeters on the upper part; but at the Cross in Cheap, or a little beyond,
we must halt for a moment, for it was here the king received, perhaps,
what appeared to him the pleasantest token of his people's affection,
namely, a purse with a thousand marks of gold in it, presented by the
mayor,attended by the recorder, the chamberlain, and the aldermen.
   On went the procession to the little conduit, where another pageant
had been prepared, and is thus described-" The conduit was hung with
cloth of arras, and garnished with the shield of St. George, the king's
arms, six great streamers, twenty small banners, and twenty-four targets; in a tower at the top the waits playing; and an old man sitting
in a chair, apparelled with a gown of cloth of gold-a crown on his
head-in his right hand a sceptre, and in his left a ball and cross, represented King Edward the Confessor.  Before him lay a lion, which, by
means of vices, moved its head. Here also, at the foot of the conduit,
was a pageant of St. George, who was represented on horseback, in complete harness, and his page in harness also, holding his spear and shield;
and a fair maiden, holding a lamb in a string.  "St. George was to have
made a speech," so Leland tells us, " and a child an oration in Latin;"
but the poor king, being already heartily tired of such shows, passed on
so quickly, that the poet and the actors were doomed to a sad disappointment.  There was a song, a very long one, of which the last lines
were sung in chorus, and ran thus-</p><p>
           <quote rend="blockquote"><l> "Sing up, heart, sing up, heart, sing no more down
            </l><l>But joy in King Edward that weareth the crown."</l></quote>
  </p><p> The procession had now entered St. Paul's Churchyard, and here the
mystery of the buried anchor was made manifest; for to it was attached one end of an enormous rope or cable, the other end of which
was secured to the battlements of the steeple of St. Paul's.  Upon the
approach of the king's grace, a man, a native of Arragon, who had been
secreted in the steeple, suddenly cast himself headlong down upon the
rope, and with arms and legs extended, slid from the battlements to the
very feet of the king; these he kissed, and having uttered a few words, ran
up the rope again, until he was exactly over the centre of the churchyard: here he began to dance, and perform sundry "mysteries."</p><p>







<pb id="p.208" n="208"/>                   .

His last feat was to attach a small rope to his right ancle, and by it hang,
head downwards, to the great delight and wonder of the king and his
sight-loving subjects. He soon recovered himself, and then descended,
amidst the plaudits of the gaping throng.
  </p><p> By this we see that rope dancing was as well understood three hundred years ago as at the present day.
  </p><p> The Great Conduit in Fleet Street was the next attraction, where a
 pageant was also set up, and children appeared in the favourite characters of Truth, Faith, and Justice. As soon as the king had passed,
 hogsheads of wine were made to run, and then the scramble for the precious juice began.
  </p><p> The last show was at Temple Bar. The gates had been painted in
fanciful colours, and the battlements hung, as usual, with rich cloths of
arras. Fourteen standards of flags were there, and eight trumpeters-all
Frenchmen, who blew their instruments in a fashion known only in
their own country. Here the good citizens took a loving farewell of
their king, and the procession passed on to Westminster without further
interruption.
 </p><p>  "Well," said Checklocke to his three friends, who, with himself, were
 all arm-in-arm, now strolling back again from Temple Bar towards their
 home upon the Bridge, "well, what did you think of my contrivance
 of the anchor to fix the rope to, eh ?"
 </p><p>  " Not half so much as I did," replied Catchemayde, " of the contrivance by which the foreign fellow flew down from the steeple. It was
an awful sight; but these Foreigners are such clever devils. Now,
none of us stupid English could do any thing half so wondrous as that.
Did you see how he hung by his foot ? If we hang to a rope at all, it's
always by our necks, which is uncommonly bad for the health."
 </p><p>  As they were passing through Ludgate, still arm-in-arm, and, consequently, filling nearly the whole gateway, they had to separate rather
suddenly, to prevent themselves from being run over.
 </p><p>  " Hollo!" exclaimed Silkworm, looking up saucily at the rider,
"you're an uncommon great man, I'm thinking, to put your horse thus
impudently in my way !"
 </p><p>  "And you're an uncommon stupid man, I'm thinking," replied the
rider, " to put yourself in the way of my horse; but no offence, neighbours all, I saw ye not until upon you; so God speed ye, and God speed
me, and thus we part in amity."
</p><p>   Saying this, the rider, who had a lady behind him, thickly veiled, put
spurs to his steed and trotted away; he was followed by another cavalier
also with a lady thickly veiled; behind him came a third, and he likewise had a lady with a veil, who clung very tightly to him, as the
courser, which was a rather high trotter, bounded along.
 </p><p>  "Hang me if I knew him, till he spoke !" said Silkworm.
 </p><p>  "What !" ejaculated Catchemayde, " not know neighbour Hewet ?
but I wonder who the fair one was in the pillion behind him. I havn't
heard of his getting married again, have you ?"
 </p><p>  " No," replied the sharp-nosed arrow-maker, " nor no one else, nor
have I ever heard that his first wife's dead-it's true she has never been








                                           <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>
  on the Bridge for these eight years agone, but that's no proof-at least I
  take it, it would not be so in law-think you it would ?"
   </p><p> "I'm  not thinking of that, nor of her, nor of him," said Checklocke,
 " but of that fairy-like figure behind Master Osborne. What a waist
 why, a wasp might die of envy at it; and, neighbours, did ye see, as
 the wind cast her dress aside, did ye see her foot ?  Stirrup never was
 blessed with such a foot before, I swear. Why, with such a foot as that, I'd
 be kicked into a blue moon every day, from this to Candlemas. And did
 you observe Master Edward? why, the clod! he seemed to take no more
 care of her than if she'd been a bundle of hay tied up behind him. I'd have
 given a silver penny to have been in his place, to have had those pretty
 arms round my waist, only I'm afraid that we should both have tumbled
 off, for I'm so uncommon ticklish in the ribs."
 "Master William, the Bridge-shooter, did not seem so," observed the
 sharp-nosed arrow-maker, " for never did lady of the pillion tug so tightly
 at her horseman as did she behind him; I think that must have been
 Flora Gray; but if so, she's stouter than she used to be some years ago.
 Lord, lord, how time does fly! why, we havn't seen Flora Gray on the
 Bridge these eight years.  I wonder what the merchant's whim is for
 keeping his women away so?"
 </p><p>"Because he's getting too rich, and they too proud," observed Catchemayde, "to be satisfied with the old dwelling on the Bridge. Like all
 your grand merchants now-a-days, I suppose nothing will satisfy him
 but having a manor of his own; they say he'll soon be made an alderman; and if once he's that, Master Hewet won't be long before he's
 Lord Mayor, depend on't."
 On trudged the four inseparables, and on ran their tongues, touching
 upon everybody's business but their own, and their ramble ended as usual
 in the Cardinal's Hat, where a glorious supper was, upon this auspicious
 occasion, to be given by mine host, Brassinjaw, to a select circle of
 his worshipful customers, including, of course, these, his four most worthy
 neighbours.
</p><p> It has often been said that a cunning knave will frequently throw a
 sprat to catch a herring, but if the rich delicacies, thrown by Brassinjaw
 before his invited friends, were to be considered as his sprat, what he
 expected to catch thereby must have been at least a whale.
 The lower room of the tavern had been fancifully decorated; but all
 the decorations were complimentary to the new king, and, as in most cases,
 where a man makes a change in his habits, religion, or even dress, he flies
from one extreme to the other-so did mine host of the Cardinal's Hat. No
one, to have seen him on this day, could ever have believed they were
looking at the saintly Father Brassinjaw; instead of his shaven head,
his crown was now covered by a perfect forest of hair; his beard might
be likened to the brushwood beneath.  A silken hood, or as he called
it, his "liripoop," hung behind; a broad collar of fine linen, scolloped
round the edges, was about his neck, and came down one third way over
his breast; his pouch, of black velvet, had been made, according to his
orders, both large and deep; but his pouch was not the only deep part
about Master Brassinjaw. At his left side he wore a double sheath of









<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>                     .

daggers; his stocks were gartered beneath his knees, but would, when
pulled up, reach a good way above them.
  </p><p> Right heartily did he receive his " dearly beloved friends," as he called
his guests, indeed, so heartily, that one would have believed the twenty
or thirty who now congregated, had been about to pay for what they
should devour; and, perhaps, in the end they did.
 </p><p>  Motley was the group now thronging in; here was the carpenter, with
his hammer and adze stuck in his girdle; the dyer, with his hands tinted
with a mixture of every colour under the sun; then came the webber, or
weaver, arm-in-arm with the tapiser, or maker of tapestry; but the
most numerous were the haberdashers; but haberdashers in those days,
were not craftsmen confined in their dealings to a few  ribbons, or
laces, or the like, as in our time, but dealt in almost all things fitted to
the wear of man, woman, and child; they had originally been a part and
parcel of the mercers, but had long since divided themselves into two
branches; and, as in all cases of companies formerly, they were dedicated
to some Saint; the one were the boys of St. Catherine, the other of St.
Nicholas.  Hatters, or hurriers, belonged to the haberdashers; and so did
the milliners; they were called milliners, because they dealt, not in
ladies' caps, as in our days, but in articles brought from Milan, such as
brooches, aiglets, spurs, glasses, &amp;c. A few military men were there too,
who swore oaths as long as their own swords, and came with appetites
quite as keen: but the oddest party of all were about half-a-dozen non-
descript looking personages; these had formerly been Grey Friars, but
now had nothing grey about them, but their heads and beards; their
dresses were formed of all kinds of material, colour and style ; these had
once been old cronies of Brassinjaw's in happier times, and now were
welcomed here, as he asserted, out of " sheer charity ;" but the truth was,
they were comical fellows, and brought to that house many a spendthrift
customer, to hear their droll tales, and roystering ditties.
 </p><p> As we before hinted, Brassinjaw had gone from one extreme to the
other, and could he have found anything further on, to have rested his
foot upon, he would certainly have stepped beyond it; his maxim was,
" Move with the times, my masters, move with the times, or you may
chance to get trampled to death by the crowds that are hurrying
onwards;" and sure enough, at last his preaching and his practice did
not belie each other, for instead of merely moving with the times, he
appeared to wish to outstrip, and run before them.
 </p><p> The banquet which he had prepared was rich in the extreme, for it
contained many delicacies which were seldom seen but upon the table
of the lordly great. Some few of the articles might not be thought very
delicate in our days, but were actually esteemed as such by our forefathers.
</p><p>  The signal being given, the guests hurried to their seats, and then
the clatter began. The helpers tumbled over each other, in their anxiety
to cover the board with the celerity of magic, and many a good flagon
of ale, and pottle of wine, found its way down the back of a guest, instead of his throat.
 </p><p> The great beauty of a feast in those days, was its magnitude, or rather
the magnitude of its component parts.  The three first dishes placed








                                           <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

 upon the board, were, an enormous calf's head, crowned with jelly; at
 the one side was placed a stewed porpoise, cooked whole; at the other a delicately roasted swan, covered with a veil of white sauce; these Brassinjaw
facetiously nicknamed the Pope, the Cardinal, and the Lady Abbess.
Two great platters of preserved larks, he called his singing boys; the dish
of powdered horse, that is, horse-flesh powdered with salt (as we should
say, salted), he named his steed of honour.
  </p><p> "But uprise, my gentles ! uprise, my simples! uprise ye all!" he
 exclaimed, in a voice of exultation, and command, as the door again opened
 to admit more helpers bearing more viands; " up, Lords and Commons,
 Priests and Laymen, up, I say, for here approaches our noble lord, the
 King, our heart's beloved, Edward the Sixth !"
 </p><p>  The dish he had honoured by naming it "Edward the Sixth," was
 borne by two serviteurs, and contained a peacock in full plumage, with
 tail outspread; great cheering greeted this magnificent display of Brassinjaw's liberality, for a peacock served up in its feathers, was a dish but
 seldom seen, excepting at the banquets of the nobility, and was generally
 styled " the food of lovers, and the meat of lords;" it was stuffed with
 spices and sweet herbs. When roasted to a beautiful brown, the skin and
 feathers were again put on, the beak and comb gilt, and the tail, as we
 have said, outspread.
 </p><p>  Just as Brassinjaw had exclaimed, " Degustibus non est disputandum,
 as the learned clerk said to the milkmaid, who preferred kissing a cow to
 himself; so take which you will, my masters, there is here withal somewhat to suit all tastes"-yes, just as he had finished this strange sort of
 grace, a heavy clattering was heard upon the stairs, leading down to the
 lower room in which they were; the sound would not have been an inappropriate introduction for the ghost in Don Giovanni; nor, indeed,
 would the figure which soon presented itself at the door, which flew open
 with a bang, have been a bad substitute for that spiritual personage.
  </p><p>  The guests starting at the noise, looked round, and there they beheld a
 knight in full armour; he was followed, not by his esquire, but by a
 sort of monster, covered all over with scales. The new comers were
 the valiant St. George and the awful Dragon of the pageant.
  </p><p>  After standing for a few minutes, to the great admiration of the
  beholders, the knight taking off his helmet, and the Dragon his
  head, displayed the well-known visages of Diddle 'em Downy and
  Ugly Tom.
  </p><p>  A thunder of applause greeted their appearance, but poor Downy was
  really downy, for he had received such a deadly blow to all his hopes,
  by the King passing on without vouchsafing a hearing to the splendid
  speech he had been for weeks concocting, that he entered with a face that
  had evidently been well washed by tears. But as every one began to
  laugh, he soon began to laugh too; so being drawn out of his iron sheath,
  he, like a well-tempered blade, not only showed his point, but how sharp
  and cutting he could be, if required.  His disappointment being a hard
  morsel to swallow, Brassinjaw made him wash it down with copious
  draughts of Romney sack, which taking proper effect upon his spirits, he
  very shortly came out as brilliantly as ever.







<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>                   .

 </p><p>  Boisterous and jolly was the party; the viands, and their dressings
were declared "wonderful," but nothing caused so much wonder to each
of the guests, as to think where his neighbour could possibly have procured such an appetite! The pope was no more to be seen; the cardinal
was fast following the pope; and the swan, the white-veiled lady
abbess, had been so much admired by the gallants around, that they
actually ate her up-not a lip there, but had tasted of her sweetness.
The powdered horse ran off at good speed under a saddle of mutton, which
was the dish above it. It was quite a lark to the company, to see the
singing boys fly down every throat; and poor King Edward, the noble
peacock, soon left nothing but his HEAD to tell his TAIL (tale). This pun
has been used several times since, but we believe it was really new
about three hundred years ago.
 </p><p>  Great were beginning to be the discussions about the various pageants
of the day, but this being rather a sore subject with Diddle 'em, Brassinjaw, to save his friend from the painful dilemma into which such
conversation would lead him, proposed a song.
 </p><p>  The moment the song was intimated, every eye turned upon Diddle
'em Downy; but, for once, poor Downy did not respond by his usual
wink of assent; no, Diddle 'em was a disappointed man-he had been
building up an enormous tower of hopes upon the effect his speech was
to have made upon the young king; his was not to have been a speech
of laudation, mixed up with good advice, as most were; for he knew full
well that good advice is generally rather a bitter pill for kings to swallow,
and always seems to increase in bitterness according to its goodness; no,
his was to have been one of such a comic nature, that he expected the
king's grooms would have been obliged to hold their lord's legs, to keep
him from falling off his horse, with laughing. The speech was to have
been the stepping-stone to Downy becoming the king's jester; but his
tower of hopes had fallen about his ears, and had completely crushed his
heart; so, he merely looked sadly round, and heaved a sigh-this caused
an enormous laugh; for every thing Downy did was thought to be funny.
Brassinjaw, who, from his former calling had been trained to study the
strength or weakness of the human heart, saw at once that Diddle 'em
was not acting; so, to relieve the disappointed droll, he roared out " No,
no, my gallants; no Diddle 'em yet; for who can sing after Diddle 'em ?
but even I, Master Brassinjaw, the jolly vintner of the Bridge, don't
mind before; so to set the concert going, list ye roysterers all to me."
</p><p>   Saying this, he cleared his throat with a good pint of sack, and,
falling into the humour of the times, sang the following loyal ditty-


             <quote rend="blockquote"><l>     I'll sing you a song,

</quote>
   </p><p>As the singer was the giver of the feast, it was not very astonishing
 that this loyal ditty met with applause prodigious! Hands clapped
 a storm of approbation that was truly deafening. Over and over again
 did the company roar out the two concluding lines. Just as they were
 repeating, for the twentieth time, the words " Down, down--   " sure
 enough, down fell Diddle 'em backwards. His fright-for he thought
 Old Nick had upset him-made him cry out lustily, which, added
 to the clatter of his armour, that he knocked down in his fall, caused
 such an uproar, that every one started to his feet. Their surprise
 was in no small degree heightened, by seeing a man's head, as
 it were, protruding through the floor.  The fact was, that Downy's
 seat being placed upon part of the trap-door, which led to the
 sterling below, by this being upraised from beneath, he was, consequently, thrown over, and it was the head of the man who had lifted
 the trap which they now looked upon. The man, seeming to know the
 place well, at once mounted, and, looking around, as if in search of some
 one he expected to see there, enquired whether "the host were there,
 or gone to the devil ?"
  </p><p> " Marry, the host is here !" said Catchemayde, "and a right worshipful host he is-that is if you want the present one; but as you seem to
 be a stranger, mayhap 'tis he who was hanged some eight years agone,
 and if so, we have not yet received any news as to his present whereabouts."
</p><p>Brassinjaw stood looking intently upon the stranger, but said not a
word. At last, the company pointing him out, the man, after surveying him from head to foot, exclaimed-" That mine host ? no, no ! 'tis
not he I sought; I know him not!" then looking closer, he continued,
" and yet, there is a twinkle, and a roguery in that eye which seems
familiar to me."

 </p><p> " Although you know not me," replied Brassinjaw, " I know you
full well, notwithstanding that years have passed away, and you now
come back, accoutred in the gear of a foreign soldier-a mercenary, as
I should guess, from your patchwork style of arms-I know you, and
you will, ere long, know me. But let us not stop the hilarity of this
right festive eve by prosy explanations-for one night you are a welcome
comer: what may after happen, will be the child of chance. Spikeley,
be merry, as the guest of your once sworn friend, the saintly Father
Brassinjaw."</p>

WHEN the merchant and his party had well cleared Temple Bar, and
got, as it were into the open country-for as yet, although there were
many houses built on different portions of the Strand, they were so
straggling and far apart, that the road could scarcely yet be called a
street-the three females, lifting their thick veils, disclosed the fair
faces of Alyce, Anne, and Flora.
 </p><p> Anne had now reached that sweetest of all epochs in a female life-
the bud of womanhood, when every leaf is opened by the flattering
breath of Hope, when Truth's bright wings seem fluttering o'er all
around. Deceit is only known by name, as some fell ogre in a wild romance-a thing to dread in fancy, but never really to be found on earth.
How strangely do a few short years reverse the picture!   Deceit is
found at every turn-Truth's fluttering wings are now outstretched to
bear its soul so far away, that scarcely is it ever really seen again-or if
it be, 'tis so disguised we pass it by unheedingly; Hope, which was first
in youth, is last in age; it now can be discerned but through refracted
rays, that to our deluded vision seem to place it upon the earth, while
its real home can alone be found in heaven.
 </p><p> Anne had not outgrown the promise her infant beauty had made, of
what perfection should be her own in womanhood: the same sweet lovely
face, that had caused her to be called the Infant Venus of the show, was
there-the same luxuriant tresses, in graceful ringlets, fell over and
partially hid from view her sweetly-moulded shoulders, and descending,
reached nearly to the waist. Checklocke's admiration of her waist, and
of her tiny foot, was but the echo of that praise which all bestowed who
saw them.
 </p><p> It is often said, that one of the greatest beauties of a beautiful girl,
lies in her not knowing that she is beautiful; this is absurd-every
beauty knows herself to be such; but every one of sense keeps that
knowledge from obtruding itself on others, and thus gains double admiration;







                                          <pb id="p.215" n="215"/>

 for in this instance, as in that of charity, we are more inclined
to bestow where we are not asked to give.
</p><p>  Anne knew full well that she was lovely; but those upon whom she
daily looked were nearly as fair as she, so that the idea of being different to others never crossed her mind. She had felt the bitterness of her
early life so acutely, that now the happiness she possessed was all in all
to her; admiration could have added but little to her present comfort;
and, indeed, the secluded life she had been for some years passing, prevented her obtaining the knowledge of any pleasure derivable from such
a source.  Her father, Edward, and the Bridge-shooter, were the only
males she ever conversed with, and those were not likely to apply the
match of flattery to that train of vanity, which, if once lighted, so often
ends in the destruction of those who allow so deadly an enemy of woman to approach the citadel of the mind. The only one of the three
who could have been at all expected to gaze upon Anne with an eye of
admiration, such as to lead the tongue to proclaim its adulation, was
Edward Osborne.   Now, it so happened, that these two had grown up
together in that peculiar intimacy of brotherly and sisterly love, which
seldom ends in a warmer feeling; so that it never entered either of their
minds to think of what relationship they really stood in to each other.
 </p><p> As they rode along, the hand of the merchant was scarcely for a moment from his pouch, unless while bestowing some trifling alms upon the
beggars who thronged the whole line of road, from the City of London
to that of Westminster; nor was it long before it was again returned to
that pouch, but merely for another alms.
 </p><p> As we have said before, the dissolution of the monasteries had caused
the whole country to be overrun with vagabonds and beggars; but,
what was worse, a great portion of these vagabonds were also thieves,
who took whatever they could get by asking, or if not easily obtained
that way, they helped themselves to what they liked without leave
given.
 </p><p> This state of things had been gradually increasing for some years,
and had now attained such a fearful height, that shortly after the
accession of Edward VI. one of the most extraordinary laws was
created, which for severity is unexampled, and will astonish many of our
readers to peruse-yes, a law was passed which ordered " that any
person found living 'idly or loiteringly' for the space of three days,
should on being brought before a justice, be marked as a vagabond, with
a hot iron on the breast, and adjudged to be the slave for two years of the
person informing against him, who, it is added,' shall take the same
slave, and give him bread, water, or small drink, and refuse meat, and
cause him to work, by beating, chaining, or otherwise, in such work and
labour as he shall put him to, be it never so vile.' If in the course of this
term the slave absent himself for fourteen days, he was to be marked with
a hot iron on the forehead, or the ball of the cheek, and adjudged to be a
slave to his master for ever ! If he ran away a second time, he was to
suffer death as a felon. Masters were empowered to sell, bequeath, let
out for hire, or give the service of their slaves to any person whomsoever,
upon conditions, and for such term of years as the said persons be adjudged







<pb id="p.216" n="216"/>                   .

to them for slaves, after the like sort and manner as they may do of any
other moveable goods or chattels."
</p><p>  A master was likewise authorized to put a ring of iron about the neck,
arm, or leg of his slave, for a more certain knowledge and surety of keeping
him. Finally, " all persons that chose were authorized to seize the children
of beggars, and to retain them as apprentices, the boys till they were
twenty-four, the girls till they were twenty years of age ; and if they
ran away before the end of their term, the master was permitted, upon
recovering them, to punish them in chains, or otherwise, and to use them
as slaves till the time of their apprenticeship should have expired."
 </p><p> As the historian justly observes, fearful as such a diabolical act
appears, it is yet interesting, as giving a clear proof of the enormous evil
of vagrancy at that time, and how almost impossible it was to check the
growth of that evil, if to do so it required such a dreadful act as the
one we have quoted.
 </p><p> When our party had reached Charing Cross, they halted for a moment,
for such crowds of persons filled up the road down to Holbien's beautiful
gate of Whitehall, which then stood across the road near where the
Horse-Guards now is, that the merchant altered his first intention of
crossing the river at the Horseferry for Westminster and Lambeth, so
turned up Hedge-Lane, a pretty lane, with hedges on each side, afterwards known as Witcomb Street, now a dirty and inconvenient, but
much used thoroughfare for omnibuses, just beyond the National Gallery.
This lane was chosen in preference to the next turning, called, even
then, the " Haymarket," as being more retired. At the top of this lane
they turned to the left into what is now Coventry Street and Piccadilly,
but then an open country road, called the "Waye to Redinge :" this
road passed straight on beyond the corner at Hyde Park, to the Knight's
Bridge. Passing this bridge, they entered Bell Lane, well known in
these days as Brompton Row: here once was a large bell, near the
turning in the road, belonging, doubtless, to some religious house hard
by, and placed there, in all probability, for the double purpose of religion, and to warn travellers of their locality in times of darkness or of
fogs. This bell, in part, appears to have given the name to a sign on a
public house now standing upon the spot, called " the Bell and Horns."
  </p><p> Our travellers soon found themselves on the common of Chelsea,
which led to the top of Church Street, still so called, and where, until a
few years ago, when it was burnt to the ground, stood an ostlery, at
which Henry the Eighth's horses were changed when he travelled that
road. Near Church Street was the ferry: here Edward pointed out to
Anne the spot on the other side where he had taken his first lesson in
swimming from his now old friend, the Bridge-shooter, and had thus laid
the foundation of his knowledge of that art, which so soon enabled him
to save the life of young Talbot.
  </p><p> "Yes," said Anne, kindly pressing his hand, " and of another whom
you seem to have forgotten-where should I have been now, Edward,
but for that knowledge ?"
  </p><p> They now passed the ferry, and as the evening began to close in, put
spurs to their horses, and, at a good round pace, but to the slight alarm








                                       <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>

of Flora, who laughed very loud indeed, to hide, as well as she could,
her fear, they made no stop until they reached the heath.
The three cavaliers soon lifted their fair charges to the ground, and
now, the signal being given, the door was opened; but such strict orders
had been issued never to open those doors until it was beyond all doubt
as to whom they were opening, that, the apparent inhospitable delay
rather pleased the merchant than otherwise, proving, as it did, that
those in care of his rural abode attended well to what he said.
  </p><p> The sharp evening breeze had given such a glow to the cheeks of the
three fair ones, that the merchant could not help shewing his admiration
of their beauty by a sly look at Edward and the Bridge-shooter, as
much as to say " Did you ever see three such pretty creatures."
 </p><p> He was once more comfortably at home, for the merchant never now
called it being " at home" whilst on the Bridge, and, indeed, for some
weeks past, he had been literally abroad, and would, almost immediately, be compelled again to absent himself from the heath and all he
loved. How long he might be away he scarcely knew.
  </p><p>After having exhausted all the topics which the wonderful sights they
had that day seen gave rise to, the conversation, they knew not how,
gradually took a more sombre tone, and was settling into that exciting,
but absurd strain, of telling ghost stories. The merchant invented
two or three, which, being brought up to a climax that made Flora
creep almost into the very arms of William for shelter, he would suddenly give such a ridiculous turn to them, that every one present felt
quite ashamed at having been nervous at such nonsense.
   </p><p>"Well," said William, " I don't know, but although I am not very
 superstitious, I can't help thinking that-and, by the by, mother,
 who grows younger every day, instead of growing older, which is rather
 odd, if she is not a witch, declares, that for several nights past, she has
 seen the ghost of -"
</p><p> He suddenly checked himself as his eyes met those of Alyce, who
 seemed to be devouring his words.
  </p><p> " Of whom?" enquired the merchant, smiling, " speak out, speak
 out! we are not afraid of hearing whose ghost your mother fancies she
 has seen-it's too absurd to look so serious about.  Was it mine? or
 Edward's ? or Anne's ?--perhaps Flora's ? But if you are afraid of
 frightening our dame and maidens here, whisper the dreadful name into
 my ear, and let me have a hearty laugh; for laugh I shall, depend on't"
  </p><p> " Oh do," said Alyce, " tell your master; for then I, his wife, shall
 be sure to know it by and by."
  </p><p> "That thou shalt, sweet one," replied the merchant, taking her hand
 in his own.
  </p><p> " I doubt it," replied the Bridge-shooter; " but since you command
 me, know then that she says for nights past she has seen the same
 vision-the same ghost of -  "
 </p><p>  Here he whispered into the merchant's ear. Hewet's countenance in
 an instant became deathly pale.
 </p><p>" Oh heavens!" exclaimed Alyce, starting to her husband. "Gracious powers! what ails you ?    William, William! what has he said ?
 tell me, tell me !"







<pb id="p.218" n="218"/>                   .
 </p><p> " Not for worlds, dear," replied the merchant, who, quickly rousing
his energy, endeavoured to laugh, and after a time so far rallied,
that, assuming an unconcerned air, he enquired jokingly, " and what
might the terrible ghost say, pray ?"
 </p><p> " Nothing !" replied the Bridge-shooter, rather annoyed at the merchant's seeming want of belief.
 </p><p> " Nothing !" echoed the merchant; " well, then, as the conjurers say,
' where there's nothing in, why, nothing can come out.' I think we may
safely predict that nothing will come out of this."
</p><p>  " No !" said the Bridge-shooter, " the ghost said nothing; but
mother says a good deal, as she generally does upon most occasions; but
'mark me,' says she, 'if before the moon shall wane, you hear not
something that shall surprise you all, believe not in my power over the
spirits of another world-murder never lies still in its bed of blood."
 </p><p> " Oh, mercy, William !" exclaimed Flora, " don't, don't talk so!"
 </p><p> "But I must," interrupted the Bridge-shooter, " I must say what I
was told to say. Yes, those were her words-' murder never lies still
in its bed of blood, nor does the murdered victim in his gory winding-
sheet. Danger threatens some one who was dear to him who's dead-
he cones to warn them."
 </p><p> " Whom means she by them ?" enquired Alyce, anxiously.
</p><p>  "She pretends not to know as yet; but what is strange, she says, is
that, whenever the vision is about to appear, her ears are filled by the
sweetest sounds of music floating in the air."
 </p><p> " Hush!" exclaimed Alyce, almost in a whisper, her eyes starting
with fear; " hush ! 'tis there again."
</p><p>  Every face now evinced anxiety, for in the night-breeze could distinctly be heard a sweet and melancholy air, in flute-like tones.
</p><p>  " This is not the first night we have heard that sound," said Flora
softly to William; " hark! 'tis fainter now-and now-'tis gone."
</p><p>  After the last sad note had died away, the whole party sat for several
seconds perfectly still, as if fearful of breaking some dreadful spell, but
what spell they knew not. At last, the merchant, who was anxious to
relieve the fears of his dear Alyce, and, indeed, of his child, and Flora too,
endeavoured to persuade them that it was merely the sighing of the wind
through the boughs of the trees, aided by their own heated imaginations.
 </p><p> "But, father, dear father," said Anne, " we have heard it before for
several nights, and 'tis not likely the boughs of trees would sigh the
self same air again and again. I could sing it, were I not afraid."
 </p><p> "And so could I !" exclaimed Flora.
 </p><p> "Desist, desist, foolish girls !" said the merchant, sharply; " we have
talked upon these follies too long already: so to rest, to rest, all of ye !"
 </p><p> Flora, taking the lamps, attended Alyce and her daughter to their rooms.
 </p><p> When they were gone-" Now, William," said the merchant, " our
good dame being away, speak out; but it was a foolish subject to touch
upon, while she was present."
  </p><p>" I know it was, master," said the Bridge-shooter; "but when once
I had got into the mire, I did not know how to get out again.  It's very
odd, though, is it not, master, that the old woman should always be
dreaming-for it must be a dream-that she sees the murdered knight

Sir Filbut ? and she says he's covered all over with diamonds, and keeps
pointing to one upon his breast."
 </p><p> " What annoys me most, in this night's silly affair," said Master
Hewet, or Master Allen, as he was called upon the heath, " is, that I
fear it will raise an impediment to our leaving the women here alone:
'tis true there are plenty of servants and people at the farm, to protect
them from real danger-- But, no no ! I will not create difficulties;
perhaps, by the morning, all will have been forgotten; so farewell."
 </p><p> When Edward had entered his room, he found it filled with smoke
from the wood fire; he threw open the window to breathe more freely,
and gazed for some time upon the moonlight scene without. He fancied
at one moment that he saw a figure half hidden behind a tree, as of some
one watching the dwelling, but as the figure gave no signs of motion, he
believed himself mistaken; and as the smoke had now disappeared, he
lighted his lamp, which hung by a long line from the ceiling, and the
room being still warm and close, he left the window open, and seating
himself near the table, for a time was completely lost in a reverie.
 </p><p> At last, having shaken this sad feeling off, but not feeling inclined for
sleep, he drew forth from his travelling bag a thick strongly-bound book;
it was mounted in brass, and had an antique lock.-" When I began to
write in this book," he said, " I thought it would be an endless source
of pleasure to me, in after years, to look back upon what I did, and
thought, and hoped, from day to day; but I have lived long enough to
find, that a diary is, to the writer, one of the saddest of sad books to
read. Ah!" he said, as he read from one of the early pages, "I
was a boy when I wrote that-it was the day of my apprenticeship.
What a little thing Anne was then ! I was her playmate in those days;
and, oh, what happy romps we used to have together! I am now a
man, and she almost a woman. Sometimes, when I look at her, I doubt
that she can be herself, and that I gaze upon her who used to love to
climb upon my shoulder, and would kiss me until I carried her around
the place, and then would kiss me again, as she said, in payment for her
ride. Heigho! heigho! I wish we could have always remained as we
then were! But no, I then sighed to be a man; and now I am a man
I sigh to be a boy! I wonder if there be, in this whole world, one human being who is content ?  May <date value="1536">1536</date> -On this day it was I saved
Anne's life.' The record of that day alone shall prevent me ever destroying this book! Ah ! and there is the night of the marsh ! Oh! I
shudder at the remembrance of that horrid night!--I'll read no line of
that," and he turned over many pages. " On this day Sir Filbut was
murdered-how strange that no clue should ever have been discovered
by which the murderers could be traced !"
 </p><p> The book suddenly fell from his hand, as he started up. He gazed
around, really alarmed, for in his ear was murmuring the very air they
had that night heard with so much dread. It was but a strain, and all
again was still. He shook himself, as though he had been dreaming,
and that motion would wake him. "Oh," he said, " this is too weak!
I'll just set down the occurrences of to-day, and then to bed."
</p><p>  He picked up the book, and also a piece of paper, that had fallen out;
he looked at it-it was anything but likely to raise his spirits, for it







<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>                     .
was the summons, written in blood, which had caused him to seek the
Witch of the Marsh. He replaced it, and then commenced writing.
   </p><p>Edward wrote a beautiful, though rather peculiar hand; the signature
at the foot of the plate is a fac-simile of an autograph of Edward
Osborne, now in the British Museum.
  </p><p> He had just come to that part of the events of the evening, when
they had heard the mysterious music, when suddenly the lamp fell from
the ceiling and was extinguished; the fire had dwindled to a few
smouldering ashes ; he was stooping in the endeavour to kindle a piece
of paper by their heat, when he again started at hearing a repetition of
the very same strain he had so recently heard before--it lasted but for
a second.  He stood erect, and said firmly, although in a low and
measured tone-"If thou be a spirit, speak thy will ! Wicked as I know
I am, as a creature of God,' I am still good enough, 'as a being of earth,
not to fear thy words or sight! Speak ! I am prepared to answer thee !"
 </p><p> Notwithstanding all his imagined firmness and determination, large
drops would start from his brow: the silence now seemed unendurable,
yet he feared to speak again, for he felt that he should start at his own
voice. He hurried to his couch, and flinging himself, dressed as he was,
beneath the coverlid, passed an anxious and almost sleepless night.
 </p><p>  Edward Osborne remained for several hours in this state of mysterious
apprehension, and it was not until morn, that sleepess fear gave way to
sleep's sweet self. A s he descended to the early meal, he was debating
with himself, how he should best reveal what he had heard in the dead
hour of night, when-could his ears deceive him ? or was he really
bewitched ? His hand was on the latch--he hesitated-for from the
very room he was about to enter, he again heard the air which had so
startled him in the night.  He opened the door suddenly, and stood
bewildered before the whole family, who had already assembled, and
were now in high glee, and laughing heartily.
 </p><p> " Heavens!" exclaimed Anne, running to him, "what ails you?
Why, Edward, 'you are ill !"
</p><p>  Osborne observing that all the rest of the party had smiles on their
faces, felt the colour rise into his cheeks, 'from shame at his own fears.
 </p><p> "We were afraid," continued Anne, " that you had heard the ghost
in the night, as Flora did."
 </p><p> "Has Flora heard it too ?" enquired Edward, quickly.
 </p><p> "Oh, yes!" replied the laughing girl, "and we've found him. Yes,
we have, we have found the ghost."
 </p><p> " Ghost indeed!'" said Flora; "no, Master Edward, but we have
discovered the cause for our alarm: last night I was turning and tossing
in my bed, thinking of William, and all sorts of other horrid things, when
I was made almost to jump out of my skin, by hearing the air
again: it came from Mistress Anne's room. I took my lamp, for I had
been afraid to put it out, and plucking up all my courage, I entered,
determined that if a ghost had come to run away with her, he should run
away with me too; and there I found-now what do you think I found ?
--why, my sweet young mistress fast asleep, singing the very tune:
she has got it quite pat, and was just now humming it t[    ]"[      ]
</p><p> Osborne again quite blushed, for he remembered th[           ]

divided his own room from that of Mistress Anne's. "But you said
just now, you had found the ghost," observed Edward, still clinging to
the mysterious.
</p><p>   "No, we have not," replied Flora, "but Bridget, the dairymaid,
has. She was not so foolish as we, for when she heard the music first,
she thought it was some wandering minstrel passing along, so going to
the gate, there she found a very nice young man, playing upon a flute,
she gave him a silver penny. ' Thank you, my pretty maid,' said he,
' and since you are so generous, I will give you something in return :' he
placed a piece of money in her hand, which, upon coming into the house
she discovered was gold. The same minstrel passes here every night,
but since that time at a greater distance from the cottage."
 </p><p>  " Come, come to breakfast," said the merchant, " and let us make a
ghost of that; the horses will be here anon, and it's but sorry travelling
this time of year, unless one has a good lining to one's jerkin."
  </p><p> "Then you must go, William ?" said Alyce kindly.
 "Ay, sweetheart, and, alack ! I know not for how many days, nay,
 perhaps weeks; but Edward and his squire there shall come down on
 Saturdays as usual, and Flora-- "
 </p><p>" Lawks, master !" said Flora, " I had forgot that I, too, am to go
 away to-day; my old aunt at Hampton is ill; I have a great mind not
 to go."
 </p><p>" Indeed, but you must Flora-I insist," said Alyce. " It may perhaps be the last time you may ever see your aunt in this world; go, by
 all means; Anne and I shall do right well, believe me; for she, bless
 her, is ever so kind, so cheerful, that I am never lonely if I only feel
 that she is within my call."
 A short time more, and the horses were at the door. Flora bustled
 about, and was soon warmly wrapped up, indeed, warmer then she liked;
 but the Bridge-shooter insisting upon wrapping all sorts of things round
 her, she was fain to consent, for she seldom had the heart to refuse him
 anything. She and William were quickly mounted, in the same manner
 they had arrived, and bidding the rest adieu, rode towards Hampton.
 Alyce and her daughter put on their walking gear, and with the
 merchant and Edward, who led their horses, strolled for a mile along
 the road towards London
 </p><p>"Promise me," said Osborne, addressing his young mistress, with
 whom he was walking, "promise me, Anne, that you will write every
 day the carrier comes to London, for, although Flora was no great
 protector, nor is there here much danger, yet, her being away seems to
 -to-I don't know what I fear, yet I should like to know all that is
 passing at the cottage, so that I may forward the account to your good
 father; do you promise ?"
 </p><p>"Why should I not ?" replied Anne; " a letter is no such mighty
 task, thanks to your early care of my writing, and the good tuition of my
 kind instructresses."  This point being settled, and the time for parting
 having arrived, the merchant and Edward mounted, and riding off at a
 brisk trot, were soon lost to sight.
 They had not gone far, before they met with two of the most ill-looking
ruffians that eyes ever beheld; the one was an old man, the other about








<pb id="p.222" n="222"/>                   .

thirty, but both were athletic, and had a dash of the military swagger
about them, although their attire did not bespeak them of that class.
So infested had every road now become with mendicants of every description, that they would have been passed by unnoticed, had not the
elder one placed himself before the horses, and taking off his cap, as did
the other, began to beg.-" Hast no charity, master ?" said the man.
 </p><p> "Ay, marry," replied the merchant, " plenty for those who deserve it."
 </p><p> "And what for those who do not ?" enquired the other, saucily.
 </p><p> "Hard knocks," said the merchant, "or, perhaps, a piece of lead in
lieu of gold."
 </p><p> " I have had enough of lead," said the elder ruffian, " and of hard
knocks too, and could tell you a little about taking what doesn't belong to
one, for I was with Tom Cromwell at the sacking of Rome; but now
would fain lay hands upon nought but what's freely given--so, charity,
master, charity."
 </p><p>  " That you may not have an excuse for doing worse-there, take
that !" and as he said this he threw a piece of money upon the ground;
it fell at the side of his horse; the old man stooped to pick it up, as the
young one said, " Have you nothing more? This won't do !" He seized
the merchant's rein, but almost at the same moment let it loose again,
for a terrific blow from the but-end of Hewet's riding-whip nearly broke
his wrist. The merchant and Edward waited not an instant; but,
putting spurs to their horses, galloped off.
  </p><p> " Curses on you for a fool!" exclaimed the old man; "that's what
one gets by having to do with boys-couldn't you see what I was
about ? In another moment I had lifted him off by the heel, head foremost: when down, one blow with your staff would have settled him,
and the other fellow would have flown for his life: he was worth the
plucking. I know him well, although he has forgotten me."
  </p><p> The younger one said nothing to his mate; but, rubbing his wrist,
kept on muttering the most horrible oaths the tongue of man could
utter.  They turned down a lane, and were soon hid from view.
  </p><p> " Never was there such a lovely morn as this, dear mother-was
there ?" said Anne, throwing open her warm mantle; "it is more like
spring than winter, the sun is so glowing. Oh, how I should have delighted in such a day as this when I was a child, to have run about
these fields, and played and romped with Edward! That's the worst of
growing old; one must not be really happy, and play the child."
  </p><p> " Most girls at your age, dearest," replied her mother, " too often
want to play the woman: they little know what cares and dangers are
attached to that envied title. Be a child, dear Anne, as long as thou
canst; for I would have thee happy. And when thou art a woman--"
 </p><p>  ' But why, dear mother, cannot women be happy, as well as children ?
I could live with you, and have Flora, and Edward, and -"   she
stopped suddenly. " Did you hear that ? she said, " How alarmed
we should have been, but for good Bridget's tale-listen! It is the
very air: it comes from yonder copse. Let us steal softly thither; and
who knows but we may see the cause of all our fears!"
  </p><p> Before Alyce could make reply, Anne had nearly reached the thicket:
 her mother followed, rather to bring her back, than sanction her curiosity







                         <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>

  the sounds of the flute had ceased, and through a slight opening between
  the boughs they saw a young man sitting upon the stones of a small
  ruined chapel: he was plainly attired, but appeared, to judge by the
  slight view they obtained, to be particularly handsome-perhaps more
  as to his general bearing than mere beauty of features. His flute was
  now slung at his back; a gun lay by his side; and he was busily engaged sketching the remains of a beautiful cross that stood at some little
distance.
 </p><p> Alyce led her daughter gently away without speaking, fearful that
her voice might attract his notice; and she saw in what an unworthy
  light they should appear, were he to observe them at that moment.
   </p><p> "But only to think, now," said Anne, " that that very young man
 should have been the cause of giving us so much alarm; and now I have
 seen him, I am sure there is nothing alarming about him. I wish he
 had seen us, for I should have liked to have looked at the sketch he was
 making. I wonder if he would have gratified us if we had asked him ?"
   </p><p> " Dear Anne, you are indeed now talking like a child," said Alyce;
 surely you are not serious.  Think you that it would have become us
 to have spoken to a stranger, and he a young man, and--"
  </p><p> " And so handsome!-I know you were going to say that," replied
   Anne. " Well, dear mother, there would have been no harm if you
 had; you always tell me to speak the truth, and that is the truth-he
 is handsome."
  </p><p>  " Let us hasten home, child," said her mother; "we have strolled to
  far away, and I am not certain that we are in the right road. Mount,
dear, on yon rising ground, and look if you can discern where we really
are."
  </p><p>  Anne was in an instant on the brow of the little hill. She uttered a
  scream, and flying back to her mother, clung round her in fearful alarm.
 </p><p>   " Heavens !' exclaimed Alyce; " speak! speak ! why this terror ?"
  " There! there !" ejaculated Anne, as she, with averted look, pointed
  towards the hill.
  Alyce bent her gaze in that direction, when she saw, just over the
  rising ground, the ruffianly heads of the two men who had so recently
  met the merchant and Edward.
 </p><p>   " Charity, charity !" said the old villain, as he and his companion
  advanced towards them; " charity, fair ladies; if we receive not charity
  from angels, where shall we look for it, eh ?"
  "Yes, yes, good man," said Alyce, at the same time drawing a purse
  from her pouch; "you are-yes ! you are, very welcome, and--"
  "Do not hurry yourself, fair lady, we can wait, and if there be any
difficulty, we will open the purse for you."  He put out his hand as if
to take it; Alyce involuntarily threw her own hand backwards, when
  the other thief snatched the purse in a moment from her grasp.
  "Merciful powers !" she exclaimed, now fully aware of their intent,
  you do not mean to rob us ?"
 </p><p> " Rob you," said the old man, " rob you? Heaven forbid ! I rob a
  lady-no, no; but charity, you know, is the surest ladder to lead to
  heaven, and he who makes you charitable, is deserving of some reward.
  You are rich, lady, and we are poor, and ' he who gives to the poor--"








<pb id="p.224" n="224"/>                    .

but I need not remind you of your duty. I'm thinking how much mole
good that gold chain around your neck would do to such poor devils as
we are, than it ever can to the like of you."
</p><p>  " Oh, no, no, no ! not that, not that I" exclaimed Alyce, in perfect
agony. " It was the gift of one I love more than life."
</p><p>  " Oh, do not take that!" said Anne; "here is mine; take all I have
there, there, and there."  She cast down everything she could tear from
off herself.
 </p><p> As the thieves stooped to pick up the jewels and money that lay
about-" Fly !" exclaimed Alyce, seizing hold of her daughter's hand; in
another instant, and they had bounded over the little hill, and were for a
time out of sight of the robbers, who, swearing, picked up the valuables
as rapidly as they could, and then started in pursuit of the fugitives.
</p><p>  "They must be deers indeed," said the old ruffian, " to outrun such
huntsmen as we. I'll have that chain, or I'll cut her throat in half with
it." He then bawled out, at the top of his voice-" Stop, fools, or it
will be the worse for you!"
 </p><p> The few moments start which Alyce and Anne had had, placed a good
space between them and their pursuers, for the poor souls felt that they
were flying for their lives, and such a feeling adds wings to the feet of
all who experience its agony ; every moment brought the wretches closer
upon them, and every moment reduced their power to fly: despair had
seized upon both their hearts, when they were overtaken, and seized by
the iron grasp of the ruffians.
 </p><p> " Ye shall pay soundly for this, my mistresses-no more foolery !"
and the old villain seized Anne round the waist, while the other caught
hold of Alyce: they were just dragging them asunder-the air was filled
with the screams of the helpless creatures-when suddenly one of the
ruffians uttering a cry, fell heavily upon his face; at the same instant,
the report of a gun sounded in their ears; the younger wretch, believing a
rescue was at hand, bounded over a hedge, and disappeared in a deep
ravine.
 </p><p> Alyce and her daughter had sunk upon their knees from fright, locked
in each others arms, when they were almost maddened with joy, by
hearing a voice assuring them that they were safe; then looking round,
they saw, standing close to them, the same young man whom they had
so lately observed sketching the cross near the ruined chapel. He assisted them to rise; when both Alyce and Anne, clinging to him, spoke
their gratitude in a violent flood of tears.
 </p><p> " Courage! courage, ladies!" said the young man; "you are safe
now; one villain has flown; and as to this monster," and he gave the
body a push with his foot, " if ever he fly again, it will be with a warmer
pair of wings than Heaven will ever send him for the purpose."
 </p><p> " Oh, sir !" said Alyce, endeavouring to compose her trembling nerves,
" to whom do we owe this deep debt of gratitude ?"
 </p><p> "You owe me nothing, ladies," he replied; " but I owe you one of
the greatest happinesses of all my life-your having given me the opportunity to serve you. You ask me who I am-a poor artist, yes, a really
poor artist; for, I fear me, my talent is as poor as is my purse-they
call me Walter Lerue."

As Alyce and her lovely daughter returned towards the cottage of the
heath, their newly-made friend, for he had, they felt, been indeed a friend
to them, made rapid progress in their good opinions; there was about
his manner a gentle solicitude which is ever pleasing to the softer sex,
and which now completely captivated both mother and child.    That
Anne should feel peculiarly delighted, was scarcely to be wondered at,
when we reflect upon all the circumstances connected with their strange
meeting.  There was a romance, too, about the whole affair, and what
sweet girl of Anne's age was ever dead to the powers of romance ?
 </p><p>  It seemed so strange that he, whom they had so lately been talking of,
as connected with their late superstitious fears, should suddenly become,
as it were, closely linked to them by the bonds of gratitude ; and then,
again, Walter Lerue being the first stranger who had approached the
lovely girl for many years past, and possessing as he did in an eminent
degree, those, almost resistless charms-youth, beauty, and apparent
good nature-caused her to feel for the moment, that she had discovered
some peculiar magic sensation of pleasure, for which she could not
account.
 </p><p>  Perhaps, all she felt was nothing more than unbounded delight at
having so recently escaped a danger, at a moment when all hope seemed
lost. Perhaps it might be the novelty of listening to the conversation of
one, who spoke in strains so different to those she had as yet been accustomed to. It was the first time her ears had drank in the intoxicating
breath of hidden flattery, and gallantry artfully disguised.
 </p><p> Walter Lerue, although young, was evidently a man who had seen
much, and understood the world more deeply than his years would seem
to warrant.  But it was that very knowledge of the world, which now
gave him the power of captivating the minds of his hearers, and taught
him that a seeming timidity, is the most powerful weapon to use against
the timid of the other sex-in fact it disarms them of their only safeguard
-watchfulness.
 </p><p> There was one circumstance, which by most girls would have been
regarded as highly flattering, but it caused Anne, more than once,
to feel a degree of pain, scarcely to be accounted for; and that was, that
whenever she turned towards their new acquaintance, she ever found his
eyes rivetted upon her, as though they were endeavouring to allay their
thirst of admiration at the fountains of her beauty.
 </p><p> Whether there was anything so very peculiar in the intensity of his
gaze, we know not, but her inward heart seemed to say-" Why dost
thou avert thine eyes ? Edward has often gazed upon their light ; but








<pb id="p.226" n="226"/>

then their shades were never lowered, as if by the hand of unacknowledged
fear."
   </p><p> When they reached their home, Walter Lerue, unlike most young
 men in such circumstances, excused himself from intruding further upon
 them but expressed a hope that he might be allowed to return at a later
 hour, when they should have fully recovered from their recent alarm, and
 then, receive their commands regarding any further assistance they might
 deem his humble powers worthy of rendering. Just as he was turning
 away, after having received a thousand thanks, arid more than one assurance of the pleasure his proposed return would afford them, he dropped
 the whole contents of his portfolio.
   </p><p> Observing the admiration Alyce evinced upon viewing one of the
 drawings, he hurriedly picked up the remainder, and said--" Although,
 I fear, the poor efforts of my pencil will but ill repay you for the time
 you must lose in looking at them, I will, with your permission, leave
 them all, until I again have the honour of waiting upon you."
  </p><p>  Anne did not hesitate to own the delight she should feel by such a
 favour, and, although Alyce by gentle signs endeavoured to check her,
 she confessed, that they had seen him sketching the ruined cross, and that
 how much she had then wished to have asked to look upon his work.
  </p><p>  Walter Lerue, smilingly replied--" That I felt so much delight whilst
 there at work, or that I should have succeeded so well-for I believe it to
 be my best effort-is no longer to me a wonder, since I now find an
 angel was smiling on my endeavours."
  </p><p>  Alyce did not hear this remark, but Anne, looking Lerue full in the
 face, said-" It is upon the good works of the heart, and not of the hands,
 that angels smile."
  </p><p> Walter Lerue felt for a moment a little abashed, for he at once
 understood that fulsome flattery was not the battery that would ever
 subdue a mind like Anne's.  He endeavoured not to shew that he felt
 her rebuke, and after one or two common-place sentences, made his bow
 and took the road down towards the town.
 </p><p>  He walked rapidly-then he ran a little way-then, more than once,
 looked back, for his vanity had raised a hope that he might perchance find
 the Beauty of the Heath was looking after him, but in this he was sorely
 disappointed, but not so much so, that it should prevent his bounding
 along, as one often does, when the mind is particularly satisfied with
 some clever thought or hope that suddenly seems about to be fulfilled.
 </p><p>  " Fate has indeed smiled on me to-day," he said; " to think now, that
 after watching and watching for days and weeks, and just upon being
 about to give up the pursuit, such a fall of good luck should be showered
 upon me. It's strange, that amidst all the beauties I have seen in every
 land of Europe, that I should never have gazed upon one so perfect as this
 simple girl, my Beauty of the Heath.  But stop, stop, my master," he
 said, all at once checking himself, as if some weighty affair had suddenly
 struck upon his mind, " in pursuing love and pleasure, the goods of this
 world must not be forgotten-no, nor the ills neither-and, I fear me,
if I be not cautious of my present ways, there may be more of ills than
good come out on't.  I'll hasten to the inn, and according to the news I







                       OLD- LONDON BRIDGE.                         <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>

 trust I shall there receive, shape my course.  I wish I had never seen
 the girl.  I think far more of her than prudence would, in my present
 position, sanction.  I did not like that immoveable look she gave me,
 when I hinted she was an angel; how many, before now, have I called
 angels, and have been smiled on for my pains!"
 </p><p>  When Walter Lerue reached the Ferry--house, which was also the
ostlery of Putney, his first anxiety was to enquire whether the letter-
carrier from London had yet arrived. Being answered in the affirmative,
and that a communication for him was lying on the table in the room lie
occupied, he flew up the stairs, and seizing the epistle, tore it open ; but
he scarcely read a line, ere he dashed it upon the table in evident disappointment. " No money yet !" he exclaimed; " not a single noble !-no
matter: they may starve, but they shall not conquer me. A pretty plight
I'm in, though-here at an inn, already owing much, and with not a
chance of paying what I owe.  I am too proud to confess my position to
the host; and too honest to run away in debt, though it were but for a
time.  Never did I wish to have the command of money more than at
this juncture, and never was I so truly poor as now.  Fool that I have
been to loiter here so long, and all for the sake of looking at the pretty
face of one, whom, now I know, seems far more distant from me, than
when a perfect stranger.  She's not one to be fooled by flattery-that's
clear to me at the starting; and as to marriage, in such a position as
mine, 'twere madness to dream of it.  No, no, let me call up the little
sense her bright eyes have left me.  The host may retain what things I
have here; they will be ample security for my debt, until I can pay
him: let me hasten to London at once, and see myself what course to
pursue; but never, no never, let me look upon the Beauty of the Heath
again."
 </p><p> The more Walter Lerue determined upon, " never, no never, looking
upon the Beauty of the Heath again," the slower did he feel the time
wear away, which might render it not unbecoming in him, to pay his
promised visit to the cottage; for, although he appeared in his own mind
determined never to see his enchantress more, it never struck him that
the best way of accomplishing such determination, was to avoid her presence.  No, with him, as with those who are always going to do
something to-morrow, a day, that, strange to say, never arrives, he
intended his never to be after the next time, but which next time he meant,
he had not thought of asking himself.
 </p><p> He had sat for some time, turning over in his mind the most likely
aquaintances he might with safety apply to for assistance in his present
circumstances, when a gentle tap was heard at the door of his room.
</p><p>" Come in," he said, but thinking it was one of the helpers, he did not
observe who was standing at the door-it was a young girl, who, without
being beautiful, possessed a countenance in which was found such
a sweet expression of the purest innocence, that few could gaze upon her
without an emotion, almost approaching to pity; she stood for a moment
timidly, and then looking on Lerue, seemed upon the point of again
retiring, when his eyes caught her moving dress, which causing him to
turn, he said almost pettishly, as if to hide himself from reproach for






<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>                     .

unkindness-" Lillia, you should have spoken; I knew  not it was
you." He rose, and taking her hand gently led her into the room.
  </p><p> " I used to speak, Walter," she said, "freely, a little while ago, but
lately you have seemed so altered towards me, that I have feared I might
offend; even now in saying Walter, I feel my face burn: you told me to
call you so, soon after you first came here; and it sounds so much
sweeter to my ears, than Master Lerue, that when I am alone, and
thinking what I can do next to make you more comfortable and happy,
I always say Walter: I say it a hundred times a day. It has just struck
me, as my father is away from home, and will be so for some hours, that
if you had nothing else to do, perhaps you would finish the likeness of
me you have been taking such pains with.  I have not sat to you for
now more than a week; indeed, it is nine days, at this very hour."
  </p><p> "You seem to keep most correct accounts with time," said Lerue;
"I had really forgotten the whole affair."
 </p><p>  The poor girl's face suddenly became scarlet, which, Walter observing,
endeavoured to soften the effect his seeming want of recollection had
caused, by saying, "I mean, Lillia, as regards the day and hour; but,
it is, indeed, a very long time since you have paid me a visit here."
 </p><p>  "You have not asked me lately," replied the girl, rather reproachfully;
" you used to be always making some excuse for being down with us, or
that I might be here with you; perhaps it were better had I never been;
but you were so kind then."
  </p><p> " And am I not so now, Lillia ?" said Lerue, putting his arm around
her; " I wish to be always kind to those I like."
  </p><p> "Like ! like!" and she repeated the word with still stronger emphasis; "like is a colder word than that you used when first you held
me thus; it then was-" and she again blushed-" love !"
 </p><p> " I know it was," was his reply; " but liking and loving, with some,
mean exactly the same."
 </p><p> " No, no ! with none can it mean the same!" exclaimed Lillia,
quite empassioned: " a thousand human beings may each one like a
thousand other human beings, but every single one that make up all
those thousands, that one can love but one !"
 </p><p> Saying this, the poor girl buried her blushing face in Walter's bosom,
for she had been betrayed into the expressions of feelings, that till now,
she had never dreamed her heart possessed, nor that her tongue had power
to tell.
</p><p>  Lerue, now, for the first time,really felt the wickedness of the part he had
been playing, a part, alas, too often played by man in his vain unthinking
years.  How many are bad, not meaning to be so, until, step by step,
they find themselves involved in a labyrinth of wrong, from which, their
only chance of egress appears to be attainable by still going on.
 </p><p> Walter Lerue was one of those, the like of whom are to be found in
thousands, not recklessly vicious, nor willingly dishonourable, but wanting
in that most difficult of virtues, the power to withstand temptation.
How many a man, ay, and woman too, who after sinning, has exclaimed,
"Oh, had I known the guilt! had there 'but been some one kindly
hand, to have pointed to the precipice o'er which I have fallen-one
saving voice, to have warned me of the danger I was hurrying to, how






                                           <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>

differently then would I have acted!" Oh! hypocrites-doubly hypocrites
-for not only do you attempt to deceive those, who in pity listen to
your ravings, but also to deceive yourselves !
 </p><p>  No crime, no, nor venial fault, is ever perpetrated by man, but he has
been forewarned, ay, and in time too, to halt upon his guilty course, and
with the power left, would he but exert it, of turning back into the road
of right.  Let any one of us ask our own hearts, did we ever do the
most trifling wrong believing it to be a virtue, or believing that it was
not a wrong even in the doing ? No! but then comes in TEMPTATION,
with his tinted glass, to give a colouring fictitious to all we longing
gaze at ; we know we are deceived; but then we have a saving clause,
as we attempt to think it, by laying all blame upon TEMPTATION'S
back: his back, indeed, must be wide, wide as the universe, if it can
carry off from us the load of half the guilt we heap upon it.
 </p><p>  Walter Lerue, was at that very moment we are writing of, endeavouring to call TEMPTATION to account, for his own cruel conduct, to the really
innocent, confiding Lillia.
 </p><p>  Lerue had arrived at her father's ostlery, where he had taken up his
abode, in order, as he said, to ramble about the neighbouring country for
the purpose of sketching, he being an artist.  To the fulfilment of
his artistic duties, he added the meditative pleasures of fishing, and the
more active and healthful recreation of the sportsman; he seldom went
out without his fishing-tackle, or his magnificent gun, which latter, upon
a recent occasion, he had used to some purpose, as the reader is already
aware.  Finding the master of the inn a far superior person to most of
those who usually fill such stations, and, what to youth, perhaps, was still
more attractive, that this superior host, had a very superior daughter,
not far removed from childhood, either in years, or manner-for, as we
have before hinted, she was simplicity and innocence personified, young
Lerue experienced great pleasure in passing many an evening alone
with the host and his child. Her perfect innocence was something so new
to Walter, who had lived much amongst the most profligate of London,
and the circumstance of finding such simplicity in an abode, so unlikely
to foster that charming attribute of woman, that he wa mightily taken
with the youthful Lillia, and throwing off the rougher man, himself
assumed the manners befitting childhood, and regarding the " Lilly of the
Inn," for so he called her, more as a lovely plaything, than aught else, he
sowed the seeds in her young heart, that were destined to bring forth the
bitterest of all bitter fruit-unrequited affection.
 </p><p> Lerue, as we have before said, was now endeavouring to throw all
blame upon the shoulders of TEMPTATION; he had, from the moment he
beheld the Beauty of the Heath, began to understand the extent of wrong
he was doing the child of the inn, by awakening in her mind, feelings
that must end in wretchedness, or perhaps in shame. He had gone so far in
his thoughtlessness, that he knew not now how to undeceive her, without
cruelly, most cruelly wounding a heart, that might have proved a treasure
inestimable to another, but to him, all its purity and brightness were
worthless.  He had hoped by becoming more reserved, and by absenting
himself more from her sight, to wean, as it were, her thoughts from one,
upon whom he knew full well they were then so entirely fixed: having debated






<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>                 .

much within himself upon this point, it seemed far less unkind to deceive her still, than openly to proclaim himself the unfeeling betrayer lie
really was. He soon renewed by kindness, or rather unkindness in disguise,
the impression of neglect which his late behaviour had stamped upon her
mind; and acting as nearly as he could the part he used but shortly since
to play, so agreeably to himself, and so fatally to her, he, to a degree, succeeded; for, oh ! how the youthful heart of woman does love to deceive
itself, and frame all kinds of excuses for those they adore!
 </p><p>  Walter Lerue, in order to change the thoughts of poor Lillia, bustled
about amongst his drawings, looking for the unfinished sketch of the
" Lilly of the Inn," and seemed to her willing eyes, the same kind
Walter she had seen him first.
 </p><p>  " Oh, I want it to be finished," she said, " so very much ; for I long
to tell my poor, dear, kind old father all, and to give him the picture of
his child  Do you know, Walter, this is the first secret I have kept
from him in all my life? and it makes me feel at times so very
miserable; for I think, perhaps, he would not like to know the number
of hours I have passed with you alone. Why did you wish me not to
tell him about the picture ?"
 </p><p>  " In order that the pleasure might be the greater, when you gave
it to him. But let us to work," said Walter, anxious to change the
subject.  " I almost forget where I put it.  I thought it was in this
portfolio," and he kept turning over his drawings carelessly.
  </p><p> " Or perhaps," said Lillia, " it may be in this: shall I look ?"
  </p><p> "Do, child," he replied, "while I search this drawer.  You know
I have twenty sketches of you, somewhere."
   "More than that," replied Lillia, "you were always making me
sit before you, and then you used to look so kindly.  Heavens!" she
exclaimed, as her eye fell upon one of the drawings she was turning
over, "how wonderfully like! and yet it cannot be."
  </p><p> "Cannot be what ?" enquired Lerue, heedlessly.
  </p><p> "Not the likeness of my kind, kind schoolfellow, Anne; or, as I
ought to call her now, Mistress Allen, the Beauty of the Heath."
 </p><p> Walter Lerue felt the blood fly to his face, yet scarcely knew why
he should be thus confused; but his heart told him, that Anne was
really the magnet which had attracted nearly every thought from the
poor girl before him.  It is true he had never loved Lillia, nor had he
ever thought of doing so; but there was a flattering to his self-
esteem, in gaining the power over her young affections, which was too
sweet to his vanity for his better feelings to combat.
 </p><p> " And here is their cottage, too," she said; " and here is the lovely
face of Anne, twenty times repeated, upon the same sheet of paper:
you never told me, Walter, that you knew     Dame Allen and her
daughter."
</p><p>"Nor did I," replied Lerue, "not until to-day; but I have often
seen them, and these sketches are merely the offsprings of memory."
 </p><p> " I do not wonder that her sweet face should be remembered," said
the girl; " would that I were as fair as she! then I might sink as deeply
into the memory of those who look upon me-I mean not that; but
into the heart's memory of one-only one  -"







                                           <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>

 </p><p>  Lerue could not resist the kindly feeling which her look of intense
 affection called up in his heart: he pressed her to his bosom, and fondly
 kissed her forehead.  He was sorry he had done so, now it was done,
 for lie knew that such show of kindness on his part would but tighten
 the bonds that held her to him, and those bonds he wished, for her sake,
 as he deceived himself in thinking, to be for c er unloosed.
 </p><p>  "Come, child," he said, " we will commence a new sketch of your
pretty face, and not lose our time in looking for the one I have mislaid ;
and while I am at work, you shall tell me all you know about Dame--
Dame Allen, I think you said the mother's name was ?"
  </p><p> Lerue knew the name quite as well as Lillia, but he descended to this
deceit, in order to appear perfectly indifferent as to those about whom
they were then to make the subjects of their conversation.  Poor
Lillia for a moment felt that all was once more as it formerly had been,
and joyously she smiled upon the young artist, as she took her seat.
  </p><p> "You had better," said Lerue, " look more that way; I have drawn
your full face, until I am tired of it-I mean of drawing it-not of
the face, for none could over grow tired of that."  The latter part of the
sentence came forth but very coldly ; there was no truthful feeling in his
tone of voice, but Lillia felt grateful at hearing even such words, and
was happy.
</p><p>   "I will look any way you like best," she said, turning her eyes from
him; " but you used to say, an artist could never give the real expression,
unless the object's eyes were fixed on him."
 </p><p> Lerue, not seeming to hear this observation, began to sketch, as he
said-" And now, Lillia, tell me-what meant you by Anne-is that the
name of Mistress Allen ?-by Anne being your schoolfellow ? Was she
indeed so ?"
 </p><p> " Oh, yes !" replied the Lilly of the Inn, " for many years; indeed for
eight years; and oh, I used to love her so. You must know, that although
poor father never talks about it, he was once in a very different station
to that of keeping an ostlery-pray do not tell him I have said so-for
he only let me know it a few days since, and wished me to keep the
secret to myself; but, I know not why, I cannot keep a secret from you;
and, indeed, the moment he told me, I felt so proud, that I determined to
disobey him and disclose all to you; it seems, that do what I will, where
you are concerned, I am led to do wrong; but this time, it is to do right,
at least I think so."
  </p><p>"But about Mistress Anne," interrupted Leru; "has she lived here
long ?"
 </p><p> "Oh, yes, almost as long as I can remember things clearly. I was
just turned eight, when she came up to the old convent house to be instructed; she was older than I was; but from some cause or other, she
knew nothing, and used at times to say the strangest words-you can't
think how strange some were; but she was so industrious, that ere
long she far outstripped the foremost there: but it was not because she
was so quick and clever, that we all loved her so much; but because she
was so sensible, and more than that, so kind. I never saw any one so
kind in her manner-but you."
 </p><p> " And do they live alone ?" said Lerue.








 <pb id="p.232" n="232"/>                  .

    </p><p> " Mostly ! that is all the week days; but on Saturdays, at eve,
  Master Allen, with two others, always comes, and remains until the
  Monday morning."
   </p><p> "Not always," replied Lerue, " for I have now been in this neighbourhood for some weeks, and have never yet seen man enter their abode,
  except the menials."
   </p><p> " That may have been, because, this being winter, they never come
  as they do in summer, by water, and land here at the ferry, but reach
  the heath by the road from London; and I believe for nearly all the
  time you have been here, the merchant, for so I know him to be, from
  Anne having told me so, has been far away; and even when he does
  come, he is but little seen in the town; nor do the people hereabouts
  know much, or indeed anything, of who, or what he is, further than that
  he gives a great deal to the poor, and all his household say he is the
  best of all good masters.  How are you getting on, Walter ?" enquired Lillia.
   </p><p> " Eh ! oh-oh, pretty well!" replied Lerue, looking upon the paper,
 which was still untouched; " oh, pretty well; but I am not so quick
 today as usual;" and he began to scratch away with his pencil, faster
 than he had ever done in his life before.
  </p><p> After workin , or seeming to work, for some little time, his mind
 appeared to be wandering far from the object of his labour.  Lillia
 looking round, found him completely buried in thought; so much so,
 indeed, that lie was quite unconscious that she had risen from where she
 had been sitting, and was now standing behind him, looking upon the
 paper, drawn on certainly, but without the slightest approach to any
 definite object.  She placed her arm  gently round his neck, which
 made him start as from a dream, as she said-" Walter, I will no longer
 keep from you all the inmost feelings of my poor simple heart-listen !
 I will now own in words, what you must have already guessed-yes,
 from a thousand, and a thousand little acts of mine ; for a female heart
 cannot long keep the secret of its affection from him, who, she believes
 adores her, as fondly as she does him.  Walter, I love you-madly
 love you ! Do not think that I have suddenly changed the timidity of
 my nature, and become bold from recklessness.  No, what I now say,
 I utter from the purest motives that ever sprung from a yet unsullied
 heart."
 </p><p>  "But Lillia-"
 </p><p>  "Do not speak to me until I have said all that the promptings of my
inmost soul now dictate; for if you check me, even by a look, I shall
sink into the earth from shame, and fear that you will upbraid me-
will hate me."  For a moment she hesitated, as if already her courage
was upon the wing.  " No," she said, as if addressing herself, " I have
pondered upon it for many a sleepless night; I have seen myself in the
visions of a wandering mind, standing as I do now, speaking as I will
speak; I then found strength and words to tell my hopes, and will do
so now.  Oh, Walter, you cannot guess the joy that is revelling in my
heart, for what I am about to say is said to make you happy! Do not
think that I am speaking from pride, but as I before told you, my dear,
dear, too kind father, was not always  what he now appears to be ; he

  was once a soldier, and one who was high in the estimation of his king,
  when that king, so lately dead, was worthy of being loved. I know not
  all the causes that first led to his altered fortunes, but that which doomed
  him to pass so many years in this most humble station, was its being
  discovered that my poor father had imbibed the tenets of the reformed
  religion: he was compelled to fly from London; the only friend he dared
  to trust, was Walter Cromwell, father to the Earl of Essex.  It was he
  who placed my father here, as being a refuge of the greatest safety.
  Here he has lived for many years-I but a few short weeks.  At my
  birth, my mother died; and from that hour, my dear, my only parent,
  centred all his love, all his hopes in me. I was placed at the convent
  school, the better to elude the watchful eyes of our religious enemies; but
  not a day was past but my father came and poured into my longing ears,
  the purer doctrines of his own pure faith. As I grew up, his anxiety
  for my welfare was ever his chiefest thought.  Oh, how I have heard
  him sigh, and have often felt a tear fall upon my cheeks as I lay, in sleep, as
  he believed, and heard him exclaim, ' Oh, my poor, poor child, if Heaven
  take me from thee, what will be thy fate ? Not one relative, one friend
  on earth hast thou but me !'  Oh, Walter, when I have heard him say
  this, my own heart seemed ready to burst !" For a moment Lillia ceased;
  but, almost immediately, smiling through her tears, she continued-
  "But now, Walter, comes the happier part of my long story.  The
  convent school having been abolished, I was obliged to be brought here,
  and I arrived on the very night that you did.  Few people ever remain
  here, so that when you took up your abode under his roof, my father
  felt at last that he had an inmate with whom he could speak as he was
  wont to do in former years. The moment the dear old man saw you, he
  liked you, Walter.  I should make you vain, were I to tell you half
  the kind things he has said of you to me; it was dangerous praise to
  pour into the ears of one so young and inexperienced as I. Besides
  himself, you are the only man I have ever spoken to: imagine then, the
  impression your kind manner and looks made upon my mind. You
  never said you loved me; but I knew  you did, for every little act of
  yours, spoke with its silent tongue too plainly for my willing heart not
  to understand its meaning. Oh, how I should blush at what I have
  already said, were I not about to say that which I feel will sanctify the
  former! Walter, dear Walter, for many days you have been so altered,
  that I could not, if I would, but endeavour to find out the hidden cause
  -I have discovered it !"
 </p><p>   Had a shot passed through his brain, Lerue would scarcely have felt
  more stunned then he did at, as he thought, his secret being discovered,
  and that too, by the last being on earth be would have liked to have
  known it.
  </p><p>  " Discovered it !" at last he exclaimed.
  </p><p>  "Yes," said the innocent girl, "I have indeed, Walter;-you are
  poor !"
  </p><p>  The relief he at that moment experienced, gave to his features a most
peculiar expression, which Lillia believing to be the effects of wounded
  pride, at being told he was poor, said-" But, oh, Walter, since I have
  found that out, I love you a thousand times better than before; and








<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>                   .

but for your poverty, you would, perhaps, have never heard the confession I have this day made."
 </p><p> " But how, dear Lillia," he said, "how did you discover my secret,
as you call it ?"
 </p><p> Oh," she replied, " you have told me it more than once, although
you knew it not. Often, when I have thought you were asleep, I have
watched near your door, that none should approach to disturb your,
slumber, when suddenly you would speak aloud, and always about
money.    Even this very day, as I was coming near your door, you exclaimed, ' They may starve, but they shall not conquer me,' and
something about ' No money yet !' And now, Walter, own that you are,
poor: I hope you are very-very poor indeed, for then my pleasure will,
be unbounded."
 </p><p> " What, Lillia, at my being poor !" exclaimed Lerue, at the same
time smiling. " Is poverty such a blessing, that you would wish poor-
Walter to be thus blessed ?"
 </p><p> " No, Walter," replied the girl; " but that I might be blessed in
relieving all your wants.  I have told you, you have won the good
opinion of my dear father; mine you know you have. My father has
saved much, and all he has I know was saved for me: he tells me too,
that now King Henry is dead, that perhaps he may become even
wealthy.  Ask him then openly-fearlessly for his child. You will
not be refused, for he would refuse nothing-not even his life, were the
losing it to make me happy: then Walter, dear Walter, all I should
ever possess will be yours. And now you know the real cause of my
seeming boldness: can you hate me for it? Why don't you speak,
Walter ? Have I done wrong ? tell me-tell me! but if I have, it was
for your happiness, which, now I have confessed my love, is all I will
ever live for."
 </p><p> Lerue was perfectly bewildered; what to say, or what to do, he
knew not: to undeceive her at such a moment he felt would be the
acme of cruelty: the confiding girl having thrown herself upon his
breast as she uttered her last words, was prevented from observing the
strange workings of Walter's countenance: his features took alternately
the expression of almost every feeling but that of real love: pity,
vexation, disgust at his own unthinking, unfeeling folly, in having led a
poor innocent child into what he knew must prove hopeless misery, now
filled his mind, and for a time, held his tongue spell-bound.  At last
he said-" Dear Lillia, your unexpected avowal-your generous anxiety
for one so truly unworthy as I am, has robbed me of all power to speak
my thanks-my     gratitude-my-    " he hesitated: oh, how   she
listened for the one word more !-the only one she cared to hear-but,
alas ! it came not; he never said " my love !"
 </p><p> Fortunately for Lerue, relief came to his aid when most desired;
the father's voice was heard calling upon his child: that sound like
magic, awoke Lillia from her dream of bliss; for though Lerue spoke
not of love, she never for an instant doubted his affection for her; and
her joy was in having, as she believed, made him as happy by her
confession, as that confession had made herself. As she released herself
from his embrace, she looked into his face with such an expression of







                                           <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

confiding truthful devotion, that he had not the power to resist imprinting upon her pure but now willing lips, one kiss of real, of heart-
felt kindness.  Poor Lillia was for that single moment the happiest of
human beings; she pressed both his hands fervently to her lips-then
casting upon him a look of intense affection, hurried from the room.
For several minutes, Lerue stood exactly as she had left him,
perfectly lost in thought; at last he said-" Well! this is a pretty
climax to my folly.  How shall I act? I would not willingly further
deceive her, nor would I wound a heart so kind, unselfish, as that I now
find she possesses.  Who would have dreamt of one so innocent, being
in such a place as this ? had I been different to what I am, she might
have proved a blessing to me.  Poor soul! why has fate been so cruel
to one deserving of all happiness ?-so unjust as to let her cast her
whole heart's hopes upon him, who never can requite her? With what
simplicity did she detail her strange but generous scheme for extricating
me from my poverty! So I am to ask her father for her hand! there
are few prettier, it is true, and I doubt me if there be many half so honestly
given, as she would bestow hers on me. I wish I had never come here !
But it is too late now to think thus: something must be done, and that
quickly, or faith, she will have obtained her parent's consent, and I shall
be married to the Lilly of the Inn before I am aware of it.  She is but
a hild; and if once I am gone, there is but little doubt she will soon
forget me, and all that has passed this day. Yes, absence is the only
cure for love's fever."
The clock of the village sounding, reminded Lerue that it was time
for him to think of returning to the cottage on the heath.
 </p><p>  " I am but in ill plight," he said, " for further gallantries, at such a
moment as this; but the common courtesies of life call upon me to
make the effort; so I will e'en away.  Besides, I would rather the affair of the morning were kept untalked about; for when the body of the
man I shot be found, some questions might be asked me, as the principal actor in the death, that, for the present, I should find it unpleasant
to answer: how foolish of me not to have thought of that before ! I
will take the shorter road across the heath, and pray of my new-made
friends to keep the secret: the finding of the dead body of a robber is no
such great wonder now-a-days, so the thing will, as usual, soon be forgotten."
 </p><p> Lerue hurried away, and to his great relief, unseen by Lillia, whom
he felt he should henceforth dread to meet, until he had determined upon
the course he should take. As he walked along, buried in thought, he
accidentally turned into the wrong road, and never discovered his mistake, until slipping upon something smooth beneath his feet, he found
he was standing in a quantity of congealed blood.  He involuntarily
started back, and casting his eye quickly around, found he was in the
very situation where the man he shot had fallen; but, strange to say,
no corse lay there.  He hastened on, and soon after entered the cottage,
where he found the whole contents of the portfolio he had left with his
fair friends arranged around the apartment, and being still admired by
both Alyce and her daughter.   One circumstance rather annoyed him,
for he discovered now, that in this collection were all the sketches ho

had taken of the Lilly of the Inn.  These caused Ann to be prodigal indeed of praise, for she pronounced the likenesses to be perfect.
 </p><p>  " All," said Anne, half sighing, " she is a sweet girl, the most amiable but most childish of human beings: her thoughts are ever on her
 tongue. What she feels she must give utterance to."
 </p><p>  Lerue felt, in its fullest sense, the justness of this remark, which
brought to his mind the whole scene, he had but so lately taken part in.
He could not help remarking to himself the coincidence of these two
sweet girls, the one loving him, the other, by him beloved; both going
through almost the same actions, speaking nearly the same words, for
now Anne was as profuse in the praise of Lillia, as the latter had been
of the Beauty of the Heath. She too, now related how they had been
for years together at the convent school. It was true, the one resided
entirely within the walls, the other for merely a few hours of each day.
 </p><p>  Lerue, who knew all before, felt constrained to put on an air of interest and surprise at what he heard.  Again he had to listen to the
story of the father having been formerly a soldier-of his superior birth:
Alyce spoke much; " For," she said, " now young Edward was upon the
throne, it was expected he would restore the old man to his rights."
She told Lerue, that for many years she had known who and what he
was; and how highly he was respected by all the country round; and
that Walter Cromwell, who had befriended him, had also befriended her,
and all she held dear ; and was just about to enter more fully into the truth
of who they, themselves, were, when Anne gently checked her mother, by
saying--" This gentleman, mother, can feel but little interest in the
affairs of people so simple, as the family of Master Allen." The name of
Allen she particularly emphasised.
  </p><p> Alyce stopped herself at once, for she knew the merchant's wish still
to remain under his assumed title.
 </p><p>  Lerue took an early opportunity of relating the strange chance which had
led him to the spot of the morning's adventure, and of the disappearance
of the robber's body; and then took occasion to say, that if they had not
already mentioned the circumstance, it were, perhaps, as well to be altogether silent upon the subject; particularly, as there remained no evidence,
beyond a pool of blood, that such an occurrence had taken place at all.
This feeling being so completely in accordance with their own, for more
than all did they shun publicity, that it was at once determined, that
beyond an account being sent to the merchant, no further notice should
be taken.
 </p><p> So agreeable did Walter Lerue render his conversation to both mother
and child, and so charmed had he become, particularly with the lovely
Anne, that Time, who never will lag upon his course, when he is wished
to do so, flew by at a prodigious rate; and several hours had been born and
died, since it would have been seemly on the part of Lerue to have terminated his visit, had that visit been, as believed to be, merely one or
ceremony, mixed with good feeling. Walter had a peculiar tact in
making himself appear at once as an old friend, and so completely had
he succeeded in this respect, before he left the cottage, that Anne
not only had displayed to him all her own drawings, which, of course, he
praised far beyond their real deserts, but had more than once, at his

 the one he appeared to admire the most, ran thus-

    There was a sadness in the air, even more powerful than the melancholy
  attempted to be depicted by the words, which sank deeply into the heart
  of Lerue, for he thought, at the moment, how truthfully might such a
  song be sung by poor Lillia.
  </p><p>"I cannot help thinking," observed Lerue, " that I have heard the
  same ditty, or surely one breathing a like sentiment, many years ago;
  and as you were chanting the sweet air, there came upon your features
  an expression, which reminded me of a face I had seen before; but
  where, or when, or under what circumstances, I cannot, for my life,
  bring to recollection-were you ever in London ?"
   </p><p> "I was born there," replied Anne, " on Old London Bridge !"
  </p><p> " But for these eight years," said Alyce, " she has resided here upon
  the heath."
  </p><p>  "No!" said Lerue; "it was neither on the old bridge, or on this
  heath, that I believe I have before seen that face :" saying this, the
  young artist fancied himself authorized to look intently     upon the
  features of the lovely Anne: he gazed so long, and with such an unmistakable expression of admiration, that our heroine was fain to turn
her head aside to conceal the deep blush his enchanted looks had raised.
  "I have it!" he suddenly exclaimed: "yes, memory has looked back
  and back upon itself, until it has met with the very object that should
  stay its further course.  Do not feel offended when I tell you of the
  vision, as it were, that has so often floated before my mind, and caused
  me  to think that we had met in former times.   It is now some years
  since, but the impression was so strong, that now it seems but as yesterday. You will smile, I am sure, when I tell you, that she who so completely resembled you, was a child, acting at the fair of St. Bartholomew:
she was called the Venus, and well deserving of the name she was, for
such perfection of form  and feature--such beauty of---Heavens !" he
  ejaculated, as he turned and looked upon the face of Anne; it was one
living flame !
 </p><p>   " Dear, dear Anne," exclaimed Alyce. starting to her child, "you are







<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>                   .

ill. Oh, sir," she continued, addressing Walter Lerue, "leave us, I
beseech you: she will be better-far better with me alone."
 </p><p> Lerue felt doubly inclined to stay, were it only by his assiduity to
prove the interest he took in the fair girl; but his gentleman-like
feelings restrained him from further intrusion, and taking a hurried, but
kind farewell, and saying in a few words all that could be said upon
such an occasion, he departed.
 </p><p> " Oh, mother, mother !" exclaimed Anne, the moment he was gone,
and at the same time bursting into tears, as she sank her head upon the
bosom of Alyce, " I thought I should have died as he was speaking.
In a moment, mother, every scene of all that wretched time of my
early life, flew like ghosts before my eyes. I saw the fiends that then
were ever around me; that dreadful woman I called my mother, stood
there; yes, there, plainly as I see you now: the poor old man, too, my
only friend, I saw-and then a feeling of shame called all the blood
from out my heart into my face. I felt it rush then, but why, I knew
not; for why should I feel shame at that, the which I had no power to
prevent; and yet I do often and often feel that I would not for worlds
have any one know the life I once was compelled to lead, although
then but a poor helpless child !"
 </p><p> Alyce did all that a fond mother could do, to remove the sad feelings
the chance words of Lerue had conjured up. We must now leave the
fair ones of the heath, and once more return to OLD LONDON BRIDGE.

</p><p>NIGHT had long tired of its dark and lonely life, and seemed to be
thinking seriously of wedding itself to morning, ere the revellers at the
Cardinal's Hat, gave indication of retiring to their various homes.
But be it known, that this was the second night of revelry-it was the
night of the coronation, and was now at the guests' own charge; and
pretty well the host did charge them.
 </p><p>  The jolly vintner, Brassinjaw, was the first to show signs of inebriety,
but the last to talk of allowing his dear friends to leave him. It was
quite extraordinary how any man, so unsteady as mine host had become,
could, when he pushed his penny, by a jerk of the hand along the table,
upon which chalk lines had been drawn, send the money exactly to the
winning point.  Not a guest there had a chance against him  at this
same game of shovel-board; no, not even Spikely, who remained the
soberest of the party.
 </p><p>  What caused great wonder, in those who had managed to retain
enough sense to wonder at anything, was to think where the host's winnings went to, for so great had they been, that his pouch might have been
filled half a dozen times over, and yet it always seemed nearly empty.








                                          <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

 </p><p>  At last, all the rest of the party having lost every farthing they had
brought with them, Brassinjaw, in a most unsteady voice, observed,
" That, perhaps, a little bed would be of infinite service to some of his
dear friends, particularly to such as found it rather inconvenient to stand."
 </p><p>  This wise remark was hailed with cheers, and every man began to hug
his neighbour in the most affectionate manner, and many even shed tears
at parting; and, as one went one way, and another the other, they
simultaneously swore that nothing should separate them as long as they
existed.
  </p><p> There were four certainly of the party, who seemed determined to
carry this vow into effect, for, before they left the lower room, Checklocke, Catchemayde, Silkworm, and the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker,
linked their arms together, and thus tied, as it were, endeavoured to
mount the steep and narrow stairs: they had all ascended some way,
when the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker, swearing that he would stand
by them to the last, slipped his foot, and dragged the whole of them
backwards into the room ; this misfortune seemed but to rivet them
closer in the bonds of amity.  Nothing could tempt them to leave go of
each other; so the other guests managed to lift them up, and placed
them on their feet, chained as they were in friendship's tie.
  Their next effort to reach the top of the stairs proving more successful,
  they soon found themselves in the open air upon the Bridge. Seeing a
  light still burning in the merchant's house, they knocked loudly at the
  door, and then gave three cheers " For honest Master Hewet;" this they
  immediately followed by all the abusive epithets they could lay their
  tongues to :--" He should never be Lord Mayor, they'd eat him first;
  and since they were now constables--"
 </p><p> This last word seemed to change all their ideas in a moment; for, it
  must be known, they had been lately enrolled in the constabulary force,
  for the purpose of protecting their neighbourhood against all immoral
  people, particularly drunkards. So, now their sense of duty rushing
  like a torrent upon them, they turned against each other, and swore
  they would take one another up for being intoxicated: this brought on a
  serious scuffle, which ended in their determining, as they could not take
  themselves up, they would exert their resistless power elsewhere.
  Catchemayde, and the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker at once commanded an immediate attack upon the thieves in the Clink.  "They
  would rout them out; they would not sneak away, as the Lord Mayor
  had done a night or two before.  No, no; they would tie them all back
  to back, and in the morning they   would lead them by a rope in
- triumph to Guildhall."
</p><p>   This appearing such a legitimate vent for their pot-valiancy, that,
 once more linking their arms together, they hastened towards that sink
 of vice and wretchedness, the Clink. It so happened that the " Bishop
 of Winchester's birds" were taking a flight that night in search of prey, so
 that the lanes were perfectly clear, when the four redoubtables emerged
 from beneath the black arch, and still finding themselves unopposed, they
 set up a shout of defiance.
 </p><p>" What !" exclaimed the smith, " have you all fled at our approach ?-
 dare not one of you show his nose, in case we should pull it off ? Oh,








<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>                   .

oh! we have caught you have we ?" he bawled out, while at the same
time he pointed up to a window, from which a man's head was thrust
Seeing this they all exclaimed, as with one voice-" Surrender! surrender!
surrender !"
</p><p>  "You be d     d !" was the only reply they received.
</p><p>  "Come down, and surrender !" squeaked out the sharp--nosed little
arrow-maker.  "Know, villain, that we are constables - constables ! do
you hear that ! So tremble, and surrender !"
  </p><p>"But wouldn't you like more than one of us, my masters ?" said the
man, giving a vulgar, brutal laugh.
 </p><p> " A hundred, if we can catch them !" roared out Catchemayde; "not
one less than a hundred will satisfy me !"
 </p><p> " Well, we must see what we can do to please you."  Having said this,
the man thrust his fingers into his mouth, against his tongue, and then
sent forth a whistle, so loud and shrill, that it seemed to call forth
echoes for miles around. Scarcely a second elapsed, before another
whistle, of like power and shrillness replied; and then another, and
another, and another.
</p><p>  These extraordinary sounds flying about in every direction, appeared
rather to awaken the four invincibles from their drunkenness; and the
sharp-nosed little arrow-maker, although he could not believe it possible, yet felt almost certain that he trembled.
 </p><p>  Often had they been linked together arm-in-arm, but never had they
been so tightly linked together as now; but, strange to say, some magic
thought appearing suddenly to have touched all their minds at once, which,
causing a repulsive action to take place, they all flew four different ways,
as hard as their legs could carry them.
 </p><p> Silkworm and Checklocke fortunately took the right road from the
Clink; not so poor Catchemayde, and the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker;
who, rushing into two alleys, each flew into the arms of about fifty
ruffians; they were at once dragged off towards the black arch, for the
thieves knew that to be the spot whence the first whistle had been
heard.
 </p><p>  By this time, the man at the window had descended, and was
dancing about quite franticly, and laughing and roaring out, " Huzza,
huzza, my Bishop's Birds ! we've caught a constable-caught a constable,
and glorious fun we'll have !"
 </p><p>  Never were seen two such poor miserable wretches as Catchemayde
and his valiant friend appeared, as they approached the man whom they
had but a moment before so insolently defied; fear had completely
sobered them both; and now their only thought was, how to save their
own lives, no matter, though it were at the sacrifice of goods, chattel,
friends, relations, and all. But how to do it ? The arrow-maker threw'
himself upon his knees, and prayed for his life.
 </p><p>  This caused a roar of laughter, and a loud call from the leader of
the thieves, to know whether there were yet a hundred present-" For
you must know, my brother Birds, that not one, no, not one less than
a hundred, will satisfy this cormorant of a constable."  Saying this, he
gave Catchemaydes nose a dreadful twist, which made the blood spirt








                        <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>

  all over him, and caused him to utter a scream, so excruciating was the
  pain.
  </p><p>  " Silence !" exclaimed a woman, " silence! or if you can't hold your
  tongue, we'll hold it for you, with a pair of red hot tongs."
  </p><p>  "But time wears, "said the leader of this lawless band, " and justice
  must be satisfied. When a boy robs a bird's nest, and carries off a
  young linnet or two, what's done to him ? Why, he's well thrashed,
  is not he ? for if he must steal, he should learn to steal something that's
  worth the stealing ; but if a rascally hawk will come and poke his nose
  into a Bishop's nest, and want to hook out a hundred full-grown birds,
  what ought he to be done to ?"
 </p><p>   "Plucked and roasted alive !" said the woman who had before spoken.
 </p><p> " But you know, brother, what's the best to do in such a case; and it's
  my advice," she continued, addressing those around her, " it's my advice
  to leave the handling of these fools to the mercy of Bludgeon Billy, our
  leader here."
</p><p>    " Leave 'em to him, leave 'em to him !" exclaimed nearly every man
 at once.
</p><p>    The leader bearing, as we have just heard, the euphonious title of
 Bludgeon Billy, made a sort of bow, in acknowledgment of the honour
 such a marked deference to his ideas of justice had conferred on him.
 "Then thus I decree, and from which there is no appeal!" The two prisoners trembled from head to foot, as the ruffian continued-" First, tie
 them back to back."  Scarcely was the command given, before poor
 Catchemayde and the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker found themselves
 fastened securely, with their backs to each other. "We will now haul
 them up to yonder beam, and roast them alive, until they are half done
 -cut off their ears, and, as a treat, the one shall eat the ears of the
 other."
  </p><p>  " Oh, mercy, mercy !" exclaimed the two poor wretches.
 </p><p>   "Yes," said Bludgeon Billy, laughing, "you shall have mercy-lots
 of mercy-just such mercy as our people receive from you, when they
 are tied to the stake in Smithfield. When thus much of the sentence has
 been fulfilled, we will hunt them through the filth of the Clink, and
 when we're tired start them to their friends in the city, as examples to
 all medling fools that dare invade the kingdom of the Clink.  To it, my
 Birds-pick 'em, and pluck 'em, and hang 'em to roast!"
  </p><p>  "Hurrah !" exclaimed the thieves, and in an instant all was bustle,
 swearing, laughing-cries from the victims-shouts of derision from the
 rabble. The rope was thrown over the beam, and poor Catchemayde and
his now other half, were hanging by the arm-pits, under which the
rope had been passed, screaming and kicking about, to the great delight
and merriment of the crowd below, many of whom were busily employed
heaping up straw, and faggots, and broken wood, to make the fire beneath
them.
 </p><p>  The agony the poor creatures suffered may easily be imagined, as the
 smoke and fire began to ascend. Despair was rapidly seizing upon the
 little consciousness that fear had left them, when their ears were startled
 by loud shouts being heard approaching through the passage of the Black
 Arch. They thought that more of the thieves were returning, until they

<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>                   .

perceived a sudden panic seizing upon the ruffians below. All was in
confusion, many arming themselves as quickly as they could, with whatever weapon their hands could catch hold of.   The women were
hurrying away, as if to fetch more aid. Many of the men drew forth
long knives; others having procured wooden staves, or iron bars, and
some even arming themselves with large stones, they all together rushed
beneath the Black Arch to meet the danger, whatever that might be.
 </p><p>  All this time the fire was increasing, and poor Catchemayde, with his
companion in affliction, incessantly imploring to be released, but no one
heeded them; the women who had but recently left the ground, now
returned, bringing with them many additional ruffians, all well armed;
the women also were armed with knives, and brandishing them over
their heads, they followed their male companions through the arch.
 </p><p>  It was not difficult to comprehend that a dreadful collision had already
taken place; the air was now filled with screams of women, curses or
men, and shouts of defiance and of rage; many returned covered with
blood; some with broken heads; others with broken arms, or wounded
limbs; one or two were carried past, apparently dead; from the increasing number of the fugitives, it was evident the thieves, for once, were
being worsted. At last the main body came from under the arch, apparently driven backwards by a superior power; fortunately, for the poor
creatures who were hanging from the beam, the crowds were forced
across the fire, who, kicking it here and there, made the scene more
awful to look upon, but at the same time, saved the two intended victims
from a dreadful death.
  </p><p> The thieves-of whom great numbers had, as we have before stated,
gone on a robbing expedition-who remained in the Clink, soon found
the force now brought against them perfectly resistless. The two leaders
of the attacking party, fought with a determination against which there
was no standing; each seemed endeavouring to outvie the other; for
pride as well as courage appeared to actuate them both.
 </p><p> "You shan't outdo me, Master Edward !" exclaimed the Bridge-
shooter, for he it was, with Osborne, who now was heading several scores
of city apprentices, armed, as usual, with their resistless clubs; "you
shan't outdo me-there !-and there !-and there !" he bawled out, as
at every blow a ruffian fell to the ground.
</p><p>  Edward went more coolly, but not less determinedly to work; he remembered for what purpose they had been called out, merely to rescue
Catchemayde and his companion, so that all he aimed at, was to cut his
way through the crowd of thieves, until he should find those he came to
save.
 </p><p> The sharp-nosed little arrow-maker and Catchemayde, notwithstanding all their shouting to be released, were never observed, being, as they
were, so far above the heads of the combatants.
 </p><p> So desperate had been the onset of the apprentices, that in a few
minutes more, the whole space before the Black Arch was clear of an
opponent, and then it was the perilous but ridiculous situation in which
their friends were dangling, was first perceived by Edward and his
companions. In spite of every feeling of pity and humanity, they could








                                          <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

not resist having a hearty laugh at the expense of poor Catchemayde,
and little sharp-nose.
 </p><p> " Never mind, never mind!" said the two, as they were being lowered
down; "only let us once more set foot upon Old London Bridge, and if
ever we are caught attempting to put salt upon the tails of the Bishop's
Birds, may we be picked to death for our pains, say we !"
 </p><p> How this fortunate rescue had been accomplished, was owing, principally, to the circumstance of Edward Osborne having sat up late that
night, to see the Bridge-shooter the momen' he arrived from Hampton,
where he was to leave Flora; but from various causes, such delays had
happened to William on his road, that several hours had elapsed
since the time at which he should have reached the Bridge, and it was
almost morning when Edward opened the outer door to admit him.
</p><p>  Edward had scarcely commenced informing the Bridge-shooter of the
affairs that would require them astir at daybreak, when they were
alarmed by a violent knocking at the door, and cries for help and rescue.
 </p><p> It appeared, that when Silkworm and Checklocke had effected their
escape, they hurried to the Bridge, and observing the light still in the
merchant's house, it at once struck them that Edward Osborne was, of
all people, the most likely to aid in the rescue of their two unfortunate
companions.
 </p><p> The moment Edward and the Bridge-shooter heard what had happened,
they lost not a moment in giving the alarm to those, whom they knew
would not be backward in such a cause, and this being the night of the
coronation, there were plenty of the wine-houses still filled with the
very boys they wanted to assist them.
 </p><p> A word from Edward, beloved as he was by almost every apprentice
of the city, was quite sufficient to raise an army of youths who knew the
use of the club, and who had courage enough to employ it against a
legion of fiends, were they told to do so by a leader whom they liked
and confided in; such a leader was Edward, and a better lieutenant than
Billy the Bridge-shooter could not have been found betwixt the old Bridge
and Wapping: how quickly they were in the Clink, and what good
service they there performed, the reader is already aware of.
 </p><p> " If I might pop in a little bit of advice," said the Bridge-shooter,
"knowing, as I do, somewhat of the whereabouts of these rascals, I
should say, having gained our end, the sooner we sound an honourable
retreat the better; by the comparatively small numbers that I saw,
there is some other expedition going on elsewhere; and if those who are
away, were to return just now, ten to one but the honour we have
gained might still be tarnished before we were safe again in our beds."
 </p><p> " Right, right !" exclaimed the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker, "and I
and Catchemayde will lead you back in triumph." He did not wait for a
reply, but placing himself in the very foremost rank of those nearest the
line of march leading from the Clink, began to move on.
 </p><p> As they were passing under the dark arch, a man closely muffled up
met them, and as he passed close to Edward, muttered some words, but
so indistinctly, he could not clearly make them out; he turned back,
and the Bridge-shooter being close behind, he said, "Did you observe
that man just passed."







<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>                   .
 </p><p> "I did," replied William, "and what I did see of him, was not much
to admire !"
 </p><p> "Did you hear what he muttered as he went by ?"
 </p><p> "He said-' Oh, 'tis you, young sir, is it ?' but whether he meant you,
or me, or any other of the dozen that were close by, I know not. Shall
I after him and ask ?"
 </p><p> " On no account," said Edward; "it matters not to us whom he
meant; so let us on as quickly as we can, for see, the day is breaking !"
</p><p>  When they reached the Bridge, the early risers were already preparing for the new day's labour; while, every here and there, were seen
jovial parties seeking their houses, after a right loyal carouse, in honour
of the young king's coronation.
 </p><p> While these scenes of noise and desperate encounter had been enacting
at the Clink, one of a different stamp had passed in the Cardinal's Hat,
between Brassinjaw and the villain Spikely.  The moment the house
was clear of the roysterers, Brassinjaw threw off the mask of drunkenness
under which he had been acting, and cheating his customers at shovel-
board, and thus addressed Spikely-" Now, Master Spikely, although
years have passed since we met, and may have caused many a change
around us, yet, do I suspect, that we ourselves are so little changed
in mind, that there need be no useless beating about the bush before we
come to a clear, an honest-don't stare, man-I say honest understanding with each other: when we last parted, we parted enemies-how do
we meet ?"
 </p><p> "As friends, an thou wilt !" replied Spikely, " for since you have
jumped into the shoes of him who owned this tavern when I fled from
England, I see not why you should not jump into all his other business
too. I shall feel his loss but little, since he has left such a worthy
representative as Master Brassinjaw. As the work I come upon must
pay us both well, I suppose the bargain of friendship between us is
already settled ?"
 </p><p> " It is !" replied the host, " I am your sworn ally-that is, if, as you
seem to promise, you can make it worth my while-not else !"
 </p><p> " Of that you shall be the judge," said Spikely; " listen !"
 </p><p> "First," observed Brassinjaw, " let me disgorge my winnings, for they
are somewhat heavy, and bear me down behind !"
 </p><p> Saying this, he thrust his hand into a kind of pocket made in the back
part of his dress, from which he produced all he had won; his system
being when he gamed, to appear to put his money into his pouch, but
really, only to drop a single piece therein, retaining the remainder in the
palm of his hand-" palming," is a conjuror's trick, and by practice, can
be brought to great perfection; he afterwards took occasion, when unperceived, to deposit what he had been thus holding, into his secret pocket
behind. This manoeuvre he resorted to, in order to be able, when any
dispute arose regarding his great run of luck, to bluster, and swear that
"none there had won so little as he," and then, to prove the assertion, he
would, with seeming honest indignation, cast the whole contents of his
pouch upon the table, in order that the doubters might count his gains,
and convince themselves.
 </p><p> This we may presume was a common trick with cheats in those days,








                                           <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>

for Spikely took no heed of what Brassinjaw was doing, nor evinced the
slightest surprise at the large quantity of coin the host produced, and,
which he carefully tied in a strong bag, and then locked securely in
a cupboard, well barred with iron, which was built in the stone wall.
This agreeable occupation being finished, mine host seating himself at
the opposite side of the table, gave signs to Spikely that he was ready to
listen to whatever communication he might wish to make.
 </p><p> " You hate Horton ?" said Spikely, with a look that seemed to enquire,
and answer its own enquiry at once. " I know it," he continued, " for
he used you scurvily enough in former times, notwithstanding all I used
to do to make him honest to you."
 </p><p> " We'll not lose time," said Brassinjaw, " in talking of your honest
wishes-but to the point. You say I hate him-I do !"
 </p><p> " Otherwise," continued Spikely, " I would not trust you. Know,
then, that bound as he and I were once by mutual interest, that interest having vanished, the bonds are severed. He knew I held a
secret that was like a rope about his neck; I had but to speak the word,
and that rope would have squeezed his life out."
  </p><p>" And it shall!" said Brassinjaw, at the same time clenching his
hand and grinning malignantly; "that is, if you but let me catch one end
on't, and he be now alive !"
 </p><p> "He is, but he believes me dead !" As Spikely said this, his countenance appeared that of a fiend. "Yes, thanks to his kind intentions,
he believes me dead-dead, and rotting beneath the sod of a foreign land.
When, on the fall of Cromwell, we both fled, we entered as mercenaries
into the service of the Emperor; and many a bloody scene of war we
mixed in. By some good luck for him, for the devil always takes care
of his own, he ever gained the greatest share of spoils and plunder, I the
most hard knocks. But my secret ever made his purse my own, so it
mattered little, that the gold passed through my agent's hands, for thus
I used to call him. At last, so goaded was he by my- ever-renewing
wants, that I felt I had strained the cord too tight; so I thought it
better to look some little to my own safety.  I therefore shifted my
quarters from the band to which he belonged, intending for a time to
keep aloof from him.  In the last battle, and a frightful one it was, I
fell to the earth wounded, as I thought, to death; but it proved not so
When I recovered my senses, I gazed around; the battle was over, and
from the stragglers about, who were first robbing, and then burying the
dead, I knew by their dress that our party had gained the day. So great
had been the loss of blood I had sustained, and so severe the wounds
Ihad received, that not one inch could I raise myself from off the earth;
my dress being but of the poorest, those who came near enough to hear
my feeble calls for help, cast but a glance upon my rags, which holding
out no temptation to their avarice, passed on, caring not a jot whether I
lived or died. At last, who should I perceive approaching but Horton.
Monster as I knew him to be, I never believed he could have proved the
fiend he did. By a violent effort, I succeeded at last in raising my arm
to attract his notice; but so intent was he upon the work of despoiling
the dead, that for some time he perceived me not. Presently turning
towards the spot where I was lying, I exerted the whole of my little







<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>                    .

remaining strength, and called him by his name. When he saw by whom
he had been addressed, his countenance became suddenly deadly pale;
I had seen that look before, and trembled, for in an instant his fell
intent flashed through my mind. No other soul was near. I knew he
held me in deadly hate, and wished my death; I was resistless, and in
his power. As he approached me, I saw him deliberately take from its
sheath his knife; he looked around-no one was near; think what
I felt at that dread moment : as he came nearer, affrighted nature
gave me power to scream. ''Tis hopeless to call for aid,' he said, as he
grinned at me like a devil; 'you laughed at me once for my childish
fears at being a murderer: I am now a man, and no longer fear to look
on, or shed man's blood: it is but justice that you who taught me,
should have some share of the harvest of your tuition-die, wretch !' he
shouted in my ear. I heard no more-but I felt one pang as he stabbed
his knife into my neck-and then my senses fled."
</p><p>  " But how," enquired Brassinjaw, " did you escape alive at last ?"
</p><p>  " By a miracle, if such things be !" replied Spikely, " and by a miracle
that would have made even the saintly Father Brassinjaw of former times
raise up his hands in wonder. When consciousness returned, I at first
believed I was already in the other world, for by my side was sitting what
I thought to be an angel of heaven; but turning my head the other way,
there sat, what seemed to me a fiend awaiting my guilty soul. I smile
at my fears now, but at that moment, worn down by anguish of body,
childish in mind from weakness and loss of blood, I can tell you, my
master, my feelings were none to be envied. But now comes the strangest
part of all: for who think you my preserver was ?-the Cripple of the
Bridge-gate-tower !-The angel by my side-the blind girl, Eoline !"
 </p><p> Brassinjaw certainly did give a look of astonishment; but perceiving
Spikely about to proceed, held his peace.
 </p><p> "It appeared," continued the latter, "that after the battle, the
Cripple had gone to' the field, to render all the service he might to the
wounded or the dying. I had been thrown upon a heap of dead, intended for burial: fancying he saw in me some signs of still-lingering
life, he bore me in his arms to his own cottage, just without the town
Although there was but little chance of my recovery, they never gave up
hope, but tended me like an infant, and thus, by their unceasing care, I
was saved from death. One more of our old friends was there, and one
whom I used most scurvily-the Abbess of St. Clair; but she forgave
me; and one night when I thought I was dying, and being half delirious, I
--- but, pshaw !-my story has already been long enough; the end of
all, is all I ever care for-I recovered, and here I am ! And now I am
sworn to hunt to death the villain Horton. I will serve all that he
would wrong, be whom they may. I want revenge upon him, and that
I'll gain, though I be hanged by the same rope in gaining it."
 </p><p> Spikely now toldBrassinjaw, that Horton was the real murderer of Sir
Filbut Fussy; but that he himself having been so deeply implicated in the
affair, and Brassinjaw, although not connected with the knight's death,
being so mixed up with the continued robbing of Sir Filbut, that they
would take their revenge in a way more. safe for themselves, than by a
public denunciation. What their ultimate plans were, time will show.

  As Lerue sauntered along towards the ostlery of the ferry, the
  awkward position he found himself placed in, on account of the young
  girl Lillia, came very forcibly upon his mind; the only point upon which
  he could then determine was, that he must immediately remove from
  his present quarters, but as to his abandoning the vicinity of the heath,
  such a step he could not bring his mind to contemplate. Anne had
  made dreadful havoc with the feelings of his heart, and come of it what
  might, he felt it to be impossible to quit so bright a treasure, just at the
  moment, he flattered himself, the full possession of it might be obtained.
  By the time he reached the inn, it was rather late in the night; he had
  purposely loitered on his way, in order that the host and his child might,
  at least, have retired to rest.
   </p><p> Just as he was entering the door of his apartment, which, coward
  conscience made him do on tip-toe, that he might not be heard, he was
  startled by a gentle voice pronouncing his name; he turned; it was
  Lillia standing by him.
  </p><p>  " I could not go to rest, Walter," said the girl, "until I knew you
  were safe: there have been such desperate people about here lately, that
  no one, it is said, is secure after nightfall, so that I have been picturing
  to myself all kinds of dreadful things; but now I know you are here, I
  shall to sleep quickly-happily!"
   </p><p>" You're a foolish child, Lillia," replied Lerue, " to think so much
  about such a worthless fellow as Walter Lerue. I am not sorry, though,
  since you are up, for I should have been annoyed at leaving here tomorrow morning--"
  </p><p>  " Oh, Walter !" exclaimed Lillia, with an imploring look, "leave here
  to-morrow, and wherefore ?-but you will soon return ?"
  </p><p>  " Why, not for some little time," he replied; " it is necessary that I
  go to London. You know, Lillia, one cannot live without money."
  </p><p>  "I wish we could," said the girl; " we should be much happier-
  at least I should, for then you need not leave me ever again. But why
  not, instead of seeking it elsewhere, speak to my father ? If once he consents to give me to you, you need not fear his giving all else you may
  ever ask!"
</p><p>    " There are reasons, my poor, generous girl, that render such a step
  at this moment impossible; there are family reasons, which I will one
- day explain !"
  </p><p> "  He says," said Lillia, "an artist is worthy any man's child; and
that talent in itself is a nobility; so you need not be afraid he will
  refuse on that account !"
  </p><p>  Lerue could not resist a smile at poor Lillia's innocent show of her
 own family pride. At last he induced her to retire, her whole heart










<pb id="p.248" n="248"/>                   .

beating with happiness, for Lerue promised, the moment he could do so
with propriety, to write to the father; he told her not upon what
subject, but her eyes then looking into her own heart, she saw but one
subject, and she doubted not but that in his own he there beheld the
same.  Thus then they parted; Lillia to dreams, filled with all those
fairy visions which young love so much delights in raising before the
imagination of his votaries; and Lerue, to think upon another ; but as
he pictured the Beauty of the Heath to his enraptured fancy, the little
Lilly of the Inn seemed to drop dewy pearls upon the picture, that
damped its native brightness.
 </p><p> Edward Osborne, although he had not heard for some days from the
cottage, was plodding on in his usual quiet, unexcited manner, for he
augured from Anne's silence, that all was going on as monotonously and
as well as usual at the Heath; in short, he was almost congratulating
himself upon the happy peaceful tenure of his life, when at last the loitering epistle from his young mistress arrived. He was very busy upon
some important affairs, which he could not leave at that instant, his
master having sailed for the Continent, by which the whole weight of
their vast concerns fell upon his shoulders; and expecting the letter to
contain merely the usual " All's well," he placed it in the pocket of his
vest, and for the present thought no more about it; nor indeed did he
remember its receipt until he had retired to his own chamber for the
night. In taking off his vest, he felt the letter.
 </p><p> " How forgetful of me, to be sure !" said Osborne, breaking the seal;
" for although it doubtless requires no immediate notice, I ought to have
read it ere this."  It ran thus-
</p><p>
  DEAR BROTHER,
      </p><p> 'It is seldom I have to write to you upon subjects more exciting
 than perhaps an account of our increasing stock in the poultry-yard, or
 of Roger having slipped his foot into the milk-pail, which, you know,
 'he did, not a week ago, and then, to amend his fault, endeavoured to
 scoop up the milky stream with his cap, declaring " What was saved
 "would do very well for puddings :" but now, dear Edward, open thine
 eyes, and devour a tale of real romance.  I have began this letter thus
 ridiculously to prove before hand, that although there was much to
 'alarm, and indeed some positive danger, yet no real harm has happened
 to us.
 </p><p>" Danger! alarm !" said Edward; and then, as people often do, he
 asked himself the question of " What can it mean ?" instead of at once
 looking for the solution where it was sure to be found, namely, in the
 letter, which was written purposely to explain.  Having looked very
 wise, for a moment, but not being able to give himself a satisfactory
answer, he recommenced reading.
 </p><p> She detailed to him the whole circumstances of which the reader is
'already aware-of how they had peeped at the ghost whilst sketching
'-of the attack of the two ruffians, whom she described so accurately,
'that Osborne knew at once that they must have been the same who
'stopped him and the merchant.'
 </p><p> He became intensely excited at that part of the letter relating their

 flight from, and their being pursued by the robbers-he almost fancied
 he could hear the gun, and see the ruffian fall.
  </p><p>  ' And now, who do you think,' wrote Ann, 'was our preserver
 No other but the ghost! and a nicer young man I have never beheld
 -I would have said, handsomer; but my mother will have it he is like
 me-and she says that people who are alike very often marry each
 other. Is not that delightful, Edward ? Only think of my being married !
   </p><p> Osborne rested the letter upon his lap, and having looked very
 thoughtful for some seconds, he said--" How extraordinary-nay, wonderful, that up to this very moment that she tells me to do so, I should
 never once have thought of her being married !-Married !" he repeated,
 as if by repetition of the word he should better understand its meaning;
 "Anne married ! and why should she not be ? Although I have scarcely
 noticed her altered form, she is now not the little child so deeply fixed
 in my memory, but a woman, and one that all mankind might covet.
 Heigho !"  He had no idea why he sighed, but sigh he certainly did,
 and then again took up the letter.
  </p><p> ' You know I am in jest, Edward, when I say this: marriage is rather too serious an undertaking to determine upon at a moment's notice;
' nor do I think I ever shall marry. Can you believe it to be little
  'Anne writing all this nonsense ? But I will try to be as serious as you
  'always are. Well, then-this our preserver is called Walter Lerue:
  ' he is an artist, and a very clever one indeed: before we knew him, he
' had taken twenty likenesses of me, only from seeing me at a distance
  ' -was not that clever ?
 </p><p>   "Clever !" he exclaimed, with a sneer; " I think it unpardonably
 impertinent. I am certain I shall dislike that man, notwithstanding
 the services he has done-but I'll go on."
 ' Was not that clever ? But ours are not the only likenesses he has
 ' succeeded in-he has made an equal number of my sweet schoolfellow,
 ' Lillia; you know whom I mean, although you have never seen her.
   By-the-by, Edward, what a darling little wife Lillia would make
' for you!
</p><p>' Hang her little wives !" he exclaimed, quite pettishly; " she had
much better recommend her sweet schoolfellow to her handsome artist.
I never thought Anne's letters long before, but this one seems endless;"
and he once more began to read.
 </p><p> 'We want you, Edward, to copy what I have written about our
  new-found friend, and forward it to my dear father, and then we
  ' wish you to make all the enquiries you can about Master Lerue-his
  other name is Walter-it will not give you much trouble, for being
  'so clever, he must be known very well in London.
  </p><p>  " Walter Lerue," said Edward, " there is an old artist of that name,
 can it be he ? But I had forgotten, Anne's Walter-" these words he
 uttered quite spitefully-" Anne's Walter is a nice young man; it may
 b his son though; I'll enquire about that; I think the old one bears a
 very bad character; indeed, I know he does: if he be the son of such a
 man, the sooner the connexion be broken off the better."
 The more he read of the letter, the more he became annoyed by the








<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>                      .

frequency of the name of Walter Lerue, meeting his eye in almost
'every other line.'
 </p><p>  " It is very remarkable," he observed, " that Anne has said dear
 Edward but once, throughout this interminable epistle; I hope she will
 not, like the generality of the world, forget her old friends in her admiration of her new. Heigho ! I think it would drive me mad were she
 ever to marry any one unworthy of her-unworthy of her ? where shall
 we look for one that can be worthy of her ?"
  </p><p> Poor Edward was quite astonished, that, highly as he had always
appreciated Anne's goodness, and even her beauty, it seemed to him
that it was only at that very moment he had for the first time discovered even one half of her excellencies. Did we not fear to lower our hero
in the estimation of our readers, we should be tempted to confess,
that at one moment, during the darkness of the night-a time when
the mind of man will lose somewhat of its strength, and when he was
picturing to himself her blessing some happy being with her hand, he
actually wept-it was but for an instant-he felt ashamed at his weak,
ness, so offered up a prayer for her happiness, wed with whom she
might, fell fast asleep, and dreamt that he was marrying her himself.
  </p><p> It was odd enough, but the letter he returned to Anne, caused to her
almost as much uneasiness as hers had to him.  In spite of all his
efforts to the contrary, there was a sadness in the turn of thought he
could not help giving to the most trivial circumstance, and more than
once, in speaking of marriage, he concluded that sentence with-" but
I will never marry."
 </p><p>  Anne was fearful that in some way, although innocently on her part,
she had given her childhood's playmate pain; but how ? She endeavoured
to retrace in her memory every line she had written, but could find
nothing that to her mind could be construed into unkindness; indeed
she had intended it to be a very kind letter; but, should she have been
betrayed into some unthinking expression that might have wounded
him, she determined when they next met, she would amply atone by
redoubled kindness.
  </p><p> Lerue having, as he had told Lillia he should do, gone to London for
a supply of money, was detained there longer than he had expected to
be, or, indeed, than he wished to be, for his Beauty of the Heath had
so completely fascinated his every thought, that to return was now his
only wish.  When he did return, alas, for poor Lillia! it was not to
her abode, but to a farm house on the other side of the heath.
 </p><p> The morning after his arrival, he was up by times, took particular
pains with his toilet, and, long before the hour that politeness could
sanction, he found himself on the road towards the cottage.  The nearer
he approached that new haven of his hopes, the more he felt that a visit
at such an unusual hour would seem strange, particularly for one who
was as yet but little more than a stranger; so, turning up towards the
higher part of the heath, he strolled about listlessly, with no other point
in view than that of killing time.
  </p><p>The morning was superb, and all nature appeared in such bright
attire, that Lerue became, by degrees, enchanted with his ramble; here







                                           <pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

he stopped to sketch an old oak tree-there a romantic gate, that had
but lately led to some sacred edifice. On he strolled-and on ran time,
so fast, indeed, that it was now near mid-day when he found himself still
far from the Cottage of the Heath, but very near the ruined chapel.
There was an attractive something about this spot, for here the lovely
Anne had first seen him; so he thought, that, as it was not far from his
straight road, he would visit it again, and endeavour to bring back to
memory all he had thought of when last there, and then compare such
thoughts with those he now experienced.
 </p><p> As he approached the ruin, he was astonished at hearing, sung by a
low and sweet voice, the very air which he was accustomed to play, and
with which he had alarmed the merchant's family. He stole gently towards the opening in the ruin, when, oh, rapture ! he there beheld his
soul's idol, the lovely Anne, singing, and sketching the ruined cross.
</p><p>  This was an opportunity that, to his romantic imagination, seemed
brought about by fate, and one he could not muster forbearance to neglect.-" I will," he said, " this day know my fate ! what is all the
world to him who loses his heart's life-the only being in all the world
who could render that world a paradise to him ?"
 </p><p> With feelings such as these words indicate, he approached the astonished
fair one; who, on hearing her name pronounced, started in affright.
</p><p>  " Be not alarmed !" he exclaimed, scarcely knowing what he said,
" 'tis I-Walter Lerue !"
</p><p>  Upon seeing who it was, Anne's surprise at his sudden appearance
instantly vanished, and she welcomed him again to the heath.
</p><p>  So different to his own was her manner, and so at variance with that
which he had expected and hoped his unlooked-for presence would have
caused, that he stood for a time perfectly bewildered.  The feeling
which Lerue experienced at this moment was one not at all uncommon
to those of excitable temperament; they work upon their own imaginations, until they cannot comprehend how it is that others can look upon
the same objects as they do, with eyes less magnifying than their own.
 </p><p> Lerue had been for whole days thinking of nothing else-for whole
nights dreaming of nothing else, but the lovely Anne; and, it seemed
to him, that it was not at all unnatural, that she, in like manner, might
have been employing her whole thoughts upon him. Observing the
little excitement his presence had caused, he felt, that to declare his passion
then, would be absurd, for few things make a man more ridiculous than
evincing violent passion to one who is passionless; so, swallowing
his disappointment, he entered into the usual style of inquiries, concerning her health, then of her recovery from the sudden illness
she had had when last he had seen her, and such like topics: but still,
the opportunity appeared so glorious, the spot so romantic, for such a
disclosure-their being alone, too, was a chance that might never
occur again-all these thoughts so perplexed him, that when Anne
asked him his opinion of her artistic effort, he looked at her lovely face
instead of the picture, and exclaimed-" Perfect!"
  </p><p>"  But," said Anne, " you have not yet seen it."
  </p><p>This observation at once brought Lerue down from  the clouds to
earth. Although very confused he did manage to cast an eye, first at
the cross, then at the sketch, and again he exclaimed-" Perfect !"




<figure id="fig.00016" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.030.DO01.00016"><head>The Fair Student</head> </figure>



<pb id="p.252" n="252"/>                    .

  </p><p> This time Anne felt far more flattered at the word perfect, than she
had before; and, hearing her work praised by one whom she regarded
as a consummate judge, she began to think it did possess some little
merit.  As she was turning it, first one way, then another, then
touching it here, and then there, she was made to start up in real affright,
by having her hand seized suddenly, and, at the same instant, finding
Walter Lerue on his knee before her. But her alarm did not end here,
for, ere Lerue could utter a word, or Anne demand the meaning of such
strange conduct, they were, for a moment, both paralyzed at hearing
a most piercing shriek. Lerue drawing his dagger, rushed from the spot,
and Anne would have followed, but her limbs sank beneath her, and
she was fain to support herself against one of the ruined columns.
 </p><p> In a few minutes Lerue returned from his fruitless search: no one
could he discover, although they felt convinced it was a human voice they
had heard. It was now hopeless for Lerue to renew his attempt to disclose
his passion; all Anne's anxiety was to return home.
 </p><p> As they left the ruins, and were winding their way round a portion of
them, a sound struck upon their ears, resembling a deep-drawn sigh; they
hastened to the spot whence it come, and there, behind some shrubs and
fragments of the chapel lay the fainting form of the poor Lilly of the Inn.
  </p><p>" Heavens !" exclaimed Anne, flying to succour her she had always
so much loved.
 </p><p> Lerue stood astounded, and felt as though he would have wished
the earth to open and swallow him. In a moment, the whole truth
had flashed upon his mind. The ruined chapel was a favourite spot with
him--Lillia knew it was so-and the poor child had gone there, day after
day, since his departure, to deepen her affection for him, by pondering
over every word and look he had ever bestowed upon her. She had
always remained there until the hour when the letter-carrier should
have arrived at the ferry-then she would hasten home, hoping the
expected letter had arrived; but, although disappointed in those hopes,
she still hoped on, and was happily building up all sorts of fairy castles
in the air, as she approached the loved ruins, and was just picturing
the bliss her future life would know-when she beheld her soul's idol
kneeling at another's feet: she uttered one shriek, and fell senseless.
 </p><p>Never had Lerue felt such a bitter pang, as he did upon beholding
Lillia lying as it were in death.  The cottage being nearer than
her home, Anne implored Lerue to bear her thither. This had been an
easy task in any other case, for her slight fairy-like form was in his
arms but as a feather, but there was a load upon his heart far heavier
than the form he pressed against it, which weighed him to the earth.
 </p><p> They were but a very short time reaching the cottage, and Lerue
having given his still unconscious burden into the care of Alyce, hastened
away to the Ferry, to remove any alarm Lillia's absence might create.
 </p><p> He felt greatly relieved to find that her father was in London, and would
not return for some time; so going to the room he had recently occupied,
for the purpose of writing the letter he had before intended to have
written, his heart quite ached at observing, that not one single thing there
belonging to him, but had some mark about it of Lillia's childish care--
of her devoted love. A rough sketch he had done, to please her,

of himself, she had adorned with flowers, and had placed it on the chair
he had mostly occupied; before it stood another seat, and upon this he
found her lute.
 </p><p> He now determined upon the course he would pursue, and taking
another seat-for he felt that it would be like sacrilege to remove those
slight, but, as his mind was now wrought upon, touching evidences of
pure affection-he commenced his painful task.

</p><p>FROM the very hour the merchant had set sail for the Low Countries,
the wind had proved so contrary, that although several days had elapsed
since leaving the river, the vessel had made no further way than the
North Foreland. At every hour, the sea rose higher and higher; the
wind howled fiercer and fiercer; and the heavy swell that now rolled
in resistlessly from the Northern seas, began to speak but too plainly of
coming dangers-dangers made doubly to be dreaded, from the very imperfect knowledge the English then possessed of nautical affairs. It was
at the commencement of Henry the Eighth's reign, that serious attention
was first bestowed by government upon the navy; but to the small beginnings made by him, may be ascribed our present mighty power on the
main: to him we owe the " The Trinity House," with its light-houses
and beacons; but the number at this time was so small, that the dangers
of the sea had been but little reduced by them; and so impossible did
the captain of the merchant's vessel find the task of beating round the
North Foreland (which then reached much further into the sea than at
present) unaided, that he cast anchor, and put up signals for a pilot to
come from land.
</p><p>  Many and weary were the hours they remained unheeded; and the
gathering storm was now so rapidly increasing, that it seemed next to
impossible that any boat would venture to bring them aid. The rain
poured down in torrents, the wind screamed, not whistled, through
the rigging; still they watched, anxiously straining their sight towards
the land, which, as the gloom of evening approached, shewed like some
black undefined monster, defying the lashing waves.
 </p><p>  At last, to their great joy, a boat did near them; but many were the
fruitless attempts it made to get to windward, which having at last accomplished, it came with a dreadful crash against the ship's side, but
by Herculean efforts the four men held her to, until the pilot, climbing
the side of the larger vessel, told the others to come aboard, and leave the
boat to its fate, for if they attempted again to reach the shore, not one
would be alive on the morrow. But the youngest one there, who seemed to have most command, declared " He'd see his Bess that night, or
never see her more."








<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>                    .

 </p><p>  " A lubberly fool!" exclaimed the pilot, with a dreadful oath; " he
was only married this morning, and if he find not a damp bed to-night,
I know nought of wind or weather !"
</p><p>   The four men had succeeded in dragging their boat, along the side, to
the stern of the ship, round which it darted, and was once more seen
tossing upon the open waves.
 </p><p>  The pilot never took his eyes from off the boat, and when it was
nearly lost to sight, he almost screamed out--" By Heaven, she's gone !"
 </p><p>  His words were true : a sea struck her, and she vanished like a shot.
  </p><p> The merchant would have had at least one effort made to save the drowning wretches; but the pilot laughed at the idea.--" We shall have enough
to do," said the pilot, " to keep our own heads above water. Here we
must remain till daylight, if the storm, which is as yet but in its infancy,
will allow us.  Had it not been so thundering dark as it is, we'd about
ship, and run for the Medway; but the sands along this coast will beat
any pilot that ever was born, or ever will be-that is, in a dark night.
Give me daylight, and the sands be d--d ! say I."
 </p><p> Every precaution that could be taken, to prevent their being driven
from their present secure anchorage, was resorted to. Another anchor
was cast into the sea, and to this, a stouter cable than that to the first,
was made secure. Every inch of canvass was reefed closely up, or
removed entirely; all was, under the pilot's orders, made, what sailors
call, "snug" for the night: but, pray Heaven, we may never pass
such a night in such a snuggery ! Although it was winter, there had
been more than one dreadful peal of thunder, that seemed to shake the
bark in every beam.  The merchant remained on deck the whole night;
and, oh ! how he more than once thought upon his happy cottage on the
heath, and wondered what his dear Alyce and his darling child were
then doing, and whether they were alarmed for his safety in that
dreadful storm.  But from this anxiety he relieved his mind, by feeling
assured, that having been away so many days, they would believe him
already safe in the land he sought.
 </p><p> The wind was blowing dead ahead up channel. It was now midnight; nothing could be seen around, excepting close by the ship, and
there all was white and foaming.
</p><p>  " See, see !" said the pilot, " is not that a light bearing down from the
nor'east ? It is a signal of distress; but our distress is pretty nearly as
great as theirs; only we have not yet slipped our cables, nor lost our
anchors, which is their case, I'd swear; or else their commander's drunk:
see how she flies along !"
 </p><p> Through the darkness, the merchant and his crew could clearly see,
in consequence of the fires lighted on board the distant vessel, as
a last hope to bring them aid, that it was a vessel about their own
tonnage, and, as the pilot guessed, no doubt had lost their anchors,
and unshipped their rudder; for as she passed them, there was
evidently no command over her, by those on board. She was soon lost
to sight; and all was dark and dreary as before. A new peril now
attacked the merchant's ship ; the tide having turned, the bark began to
vere round, and as it did so, received some awful seas against her sides.
 </p><p> " If a third sea had struck us then," said the pilot, "as quickly as








                                           <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>

the second did the first, we should not have troubled our friends by
calling upon them to morrow !"
</p><p>  Bang-bang-went sea after sea against the ship; one passed entirely
over her, but no one was swept away.
 </p><p> " It's gone !" exclaimed the pilot, as one of their cables snapped like a
thread; " and there goes the other !" he continued, as in like manner
the second broke. " Now then, a stout hand to the helm, and a stout
faith in God, alone can save us !"  He flew to the stern of the vessel,
and, aided by one of the strongest seamen aboard, attempted to give the
safest direction he could guess at, to the flying vessel.
</p><p>  As if Heaven had heard the rough, but sincere command, to place " a
stout faith in God," the wind, as if by a miracle, began to abate. With
what fervency did the merchant now offer up thanksgivings. Not that
the danger was over, but that he felt that hope might once more look
around, though still affrighted.
 </p><p> "I think the morning will never break," said the pilot, " and if we
can't distinguish between the surge of these waves, and the breakers on
the sands, we shall require spectacles, I can tell you, that can look
through a pitch barrel, before we shall be able to find our way through
the danger !"
 </p><p> Although prodigiously rough, yet, as the wind began in a degree to
die away, the waves too seemed more inclined to be at peace.
 </p><p> "Egad, the clouds are breaking !" said the pilot, as he looked up into
the face of Heaven, which was still scowling blackly upon the angry
billows; " if they should quarrel, and fly asunder in half an hour, we
may yet get light enough from the moon, that should be behind them !"
  Anxiously did the merchant watch every movement of the dense
masses, that now began to roll majestically along the skies; and, as for
one moment, a spot of light shot between the clouds, a sudden hope
seemed to fill every breast, and all exclaimed " there! there !" But the
spirit of hope again closed her eyes, and all was once more dark upon the
waters.
 </p><p> Perhaps nothing tended so much to raise the sinking spirits of all
aboard, as suddenly to hear the pilot humming to himself, a bit of a well-
known ditty. It is astonishing, how much may be done by a well-timed
apparent confidence in one's self, when we would gain the confidence of
those about us.
</p><p>  The heavens were certainlyless dark, though apparently not less stormy;
and now in quicker succession, and of longer duration, came patches of
pale light, shewing faintly through the thinner clouds. As they approached nearer and nearer to the dread sands, the moon in pity struggled
hard to pass between the clouds, and did at last succeed sufficiently to
shew, by the breakers, where those sands lay; and as the tide had fallen
rapidly, in many places their treacherous heads were high above the
surging waters.
 </p><p> " She's there !" said the pilot, pointing towards some shapeless black
masses, that were already half embedded in the sands, " she's there,
sure enough ! that is, as much as is left of her. I thought when we saw
her scudding along, she would be stopped in her mad-headed course by
that sand-trap.  After the next tide has risen and fallen, you'll not see








<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>                   .

a beam of her remaining; those sands are devils; they first destroy all
that comes near them, and then they dig huge graves for their victims,
and bury 'em outright."
 </p><p>  So near had they approached to the shore at one point, that they
 could distinctly hear the tolling of a solemn-sounding bell; this they
 felt was being rung for the purpose of dispelling the storm; for, as we
 have before noticed, bells were supposed, after having been baptized, to
 possess that wondrous power. On hearing this, many a rough hand
 was making the sign of the cross, and many a vow was being offered up
 to Heaven, that if they were but permitted again to reach their homes
 in safety, how amended should be their lives. But few, we fear, remembered those vows, save, perhaps, the merchant, who did, in after
 times, fulfil to the letter, all he then promised in that hour of peril.
</p><p>   So much had the light increased, that now the pilot felt sure that
they should reach the mouth of the Medway in safety, and there they
would remain until the weather should change, and allow them, once
more to ' bout ship," and sail for their destined port; but the merchant's
dangers were not yet over; for, as they continued their course, between
the shore and the sand-banks, something struck against their vessel,
which, as it floated past, proved to be the shattered remains of a boat.
On seeing this, the pilot declared, that he believed every soul aboard the
vessel that had been wrecked, must have perished; for, in all likelihood,
that boat had been used as their last hope, which, having failed them,
they had all gone down.
 </p><p>  The merchant, who had been throughout the storm one of the most
 atchful, and had, more than once, been of service by that watchfulness, was now attentively looking upon the sand-bank, and judging by
 the breakers, whether they were approaching too near the shoals, suddenly exclaimed-" By Heavens! there is something moving on the
 sands-look there, there !"
 </p><p>  All hands ran to the side of the vessel where the merchant stood, and
through the hazy atmosphere distinguished, although but very imperfactly, what they believed to be some wretched human beings, awaiting
the rising of the tide to bring them that death, from which, for a short
space, these sands had rescued them.
 </p><p>  The pilot declared it would be madness to attempt to offer them
succour; but the merchant first entreated, then commanded, that, however hopeless the attempt, it should be made.
 </p><p>  " Well," said the pilot, " if your humanity is so fool-hardy, perhaps
you'll be the first to jump into the boat when it is lowered, that is, if it
isn't swamped before you get over the ship's side. All I know is that
I would be the last."
 </p><p> " I will be the first !" exclaimed the merchant, ' for I ask no man to
meet a danger I fear to meet myself: will any follow me to the trial ?"
 </p><p> For an instant, all hands hung back; but it was but for an instant,
when one and all swore they'd follow the merchant, if he led them
to the very devil himself. The boat was lowered with the merchant,
and three of the stoutest hands aboard. She touched the waves-it was
a fearful moment: in another instant she was tossing upon their white
crests, and was right upon her course towards the bank.

 </p><p> While the merchant was thus surrounded by the perils of the storm,
upon the sea, Osborne was encountering perils scarcely less formidable,
upon Old London Bridge: so tremendous had been the power of the
winds, that more than one dwelling was unroofed, windows were blown
in, and in one instance, an entire house was carried from the Bridge, into
the raging flood; three tides ebbed and flowed within nine hours; or, an
effect, similar to the rising and falling of the tide, had been produced by
thepower of the wind; but, as in olden times everything at all strange
was attributed to miracles, this circumstance was accordingly attributed
to supernatural power, as a warning to the good folks of the Bridge, that
some dire calamity was about to visit the kingdom.
 </p><p> Osborne, and the Bridge-shooter, had been busily engaged for hours,
strengthening, as well as they could, the weaker parts of the dwelling,
such as the casements, and the doors that opened upon the balconies.
Many persons were severely wounded by the falling of sign-boards.
 </p><p> Poor Silkworm, and the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker, appeared
doomed to be cast into awkward and ridiculous situations, for just as
they were congratulating themselves upon being so snug and warm in
their little garret, a tremendous gust of wind rushed past with such resistless power, that it carried away the whole front of the gable end of
their dwelling, leaving them all at once exposed to the pelting of the
pitiless storm, and in a position not unattended with real danger.
 </p><p> " It is an awful night," said Osborne, addressing the Bridge-shooter;
"many a poor soul will find a watery grave before the morning: how fortunate for our good master, that he left the river when he did, or I should
have trembled for his safety; but he must, long ere this have reached the
end of his voyage; the Dutch coast is an awkward place in such weather
as this, and---Heavens !" he exclaimed, starting up, " that crash-
surely, the whole Bridge is giving way !' They hurried down to ascertain
the cause of the fearful noise they had heard. They found the people on
the Bridge in great consternation ; the house, which we mentioned above,
had at that moment given way from the one opposite, to which it had been
bound by strong beams, crossing from roof to roof; and had fallen over into
the river. Fortunately, those who had dwelt in it, upon hearing a
violent cracking of the timbers, had run out, and thus had saved their
lives.
  </p><p> The building on the opposite side, was rendered, by the loss of its
former support, most perilous; every means were at once resorted to, to
tie it with ropes and chains, to those buildings of more substantial construction, which stood near; props were being applied, and indeed every
precaution was taken, that such an unlooked for disaster rendered
possible.
 </p><p>  It was just after this accident, that the wind suddenly became less
 violent, and people began to hope that they might possibly pass the rest
 of the night in their beds. The hurricane which had thrown the house
 from the Bridge into the flood, was the same that had snapped the cables of
 the merchant's ship, and placed him and the crew in such imminent peril
 It must have been, too, exactly at the moment when the merchant had
 gone to hazard his own life, in attempting to rescue from death, the poor

wretches on the sands, that Osborne and his companion were startled by
a loud knocking at the outward door.
 </p><p> "It's an odd time of night, and an odd night, too, for visitors," said
the Bridge-shooter, "unless, indeed, it's some poor devil, whose house has
given him the slip, as our neighbour, the lantern-maker's has just done,
and so wants to beg shelter !"
 </p><p> "And I think it still odder," replied Edward, "that you should allow
any poor devil to lack a shelter for one moment, in such weather, when
it is in your power to bestow it.  Open the door quickly, and be it
whom it may, ask them in and welcome !"
</p><p>  The Bridge-shooter, who never stayed to argue upon any order given
by Osborne, was at the door in one minute, and in the next re-entering
the apartment where Edward was sitting, followed by a stranger closely
muffled up in a cloak, which, considering the storm, did not appear very
out of the way, nor a very unwise style of habiliment.  The stranger
wore a military cap, made after the foreign fashion, and Osborne, who
might be supposed to understand something of cloth, saw with half an
eye, that the cloak, too, was not of English make.
 </p><p>  The stranger, that is as much as could be seen of him, appeared to
have been terribly knocked about, for upon removing his cap, which he
did, quite in military style, a deep indenture of the skull was seen on
the right of his forehead, and over his left eye he wore a bandage, which
passing round his head, concealed the greater part of a face, weather-
beaten, and the little that was left exposed, appeared to be by no means
prepossessing.
  </p><p> "Are you Edward Osborne ?"    enquired the stranger, addressing
Osborne.
 </p><p> " I am," replied the other. "And what may be your commands with
Edward Osborne ? pressing, I should imagine, they must be, or I should
not have had the honour of a visit, on such a night as this !"
 </p><p> " When a soldier has a duty to perform," said the stranger, " it is not
often the weather stops him in his course! My commands were to see
you immediately on my arrival-and here I am! and as 'tis you, young
gentleman---   hat are you staring at ?" he said, with a frown, as he
turned upon the Bridge-shooter, who, upon hearing the last words, opened
his mouth, and was really staring at the stranger; " is there anything so
wonderful, in calling Edward Osborne a young gentleman ? I may perhaps
say something presently, that will make you stare in right earnest; that
is, if it so please Edward Osborne you should remain to hear it."
 </p><p> What was passing at that moment in the mind of the Bridge-shooter,
he for the present kept to himself; and as Edward assured the stranger
that he held no secrets from his friend, the latter continued-
 </p><p>  And as it is you, young gentleman," here he again gave an angry
look at William, "to whom I was sent, I will at once disclose my mission
You know a villain, named Horton, Harry Horton ?"
  </p><p>" He was my fellow apprentice !" replied Edward, " and I grieve to
say, that I have heard things concerning him, which, for his own sake,
I would have willingly had never reached my ears. But what of him-
he went abroad some years ago, and is in all likelihood dead, for since he
left England, we have never heard a word concerning him,"







                                           <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>

 </p><p> " He lives !" said the stranger; " and it is to tell you that he lives,
and put you on your guard, that I am here !"
 </p><p> " Why to put me on my guard ?" said Edward; " I never wronged
him; and though he be, I know, of a violent and unforgiving temper,
fear him not-why should I ?"
</p><p>  " Because," said the stranger, " you befriended those whom he hated,
and wished dead! I mean a blind girl called Eoline, and the Cripple who
married her !"
 </p><p> "Know you aught of them ?" exclaimed Edward, anxiously. " It is
so long since I have received any tidings, that I feared me some mischance had befallen them!"
 </p><p> " They are well!" said the stranger; " but Horton believes the girl is
in the other world; and as the times have changed since he fled this land,
he intends to return to England, and lay claim to all that should he hers."
 </p><p> " You are jesting," said Edward, with an incredulous smile, " you
are jesting surely ! Why, Eoline was a poor blind creature kept on charity
by the good sisters, the Poor Clares, of the Minories."
</p><p>  "  know nothing about who, or what she was, or is, or may be; all I
do know, is what I was told to repeat to you; and to place in your hands
a charm !"
 </p><p> "A charm!" exclaimed the Bridge-shooter, thinking of the witch,
his mother.
 </p><p> " Yes, starer !" said the man, " a charm, and one so powerful, that it
must not be used until the last extremity, when-" and the stranger's
eye sparkled, as he said with a voice of exultation-" when, though he be
as high, in his own conceit, above all earthly power to harm him, as the
skies are above the powers of earth, yet shall it bring him down, down
to your feet, as though his hamstrings had been shot asunder: when the
hour shall come, that all other hope be lost, and he seem resistless, take
from your breast this charm; it is a talisman sent from the mouldering
dead, to turn his blood to ice-and will !" So powerfully did the stranger
utter this speech, and with such apparent belief in the mystic talisman
he was about to reveal, that, in spite of themselves, both the Bridge-
shooter and Edward became quite excited; the latter exclaimed-
" Where, where is this potent charm ?"
 </p><p> "This here !" shouted the stranger, at the same time dashing his hand
loudly upon the table; he raised it-and there lay the blood-stained knife,
with which Horton had murdered Sir Filbut in the wood.
 </p><p> " What means that rusted knife ?" enquired Osborne, who, not knowing the use it had once been put to, saw in it, but little likely to effect
such wonders, as it was promised to perform.
 </p><p>  " No matter now!" replied the other; " but guard it well; keep it
from every eye but those that now behold it, at least until the time, the
proper time shall come to make all sure-farewell !"
 </p><p>  "Stay !" exclaimed Edward; " do not depart without being more explicit; you speak of danger to be guarded against, but say not what that
danger is-you speak in riddles-who, and what are you ?"
 </p><p>  " A man without a name !" replied the stranger, " and to you, intend
to remain such; we may, or we may not meet again: guard well that

charm; use it as I have told you; when it be necessary that you should
know more, the Witch of Houndsditch will reveal it."
 </p><p>  "The Witch of Houndsditch !" exclaimed the Bridge-shooter; "why,
 that's my mother; but she an't a witch, nor ever was, nor ever will be !"
  </p><p> " Peace, fool," said the stranger, " and shew me the door !" Then turning towards Edward, he said-" A silent tongue makes a wise head;
open thine eyes, but close thy lips; do as I have commanded, and you
will snare a villain, and befriend your friends-farewell !"
 </p><p>  The stranger waited not for further parley, but hurrying down the
dark stairs, was soon heard slamming the outer door.
 </p><p>  " Follow him !" exclaimed Edward, the moment they heard the door
close, "follow him, but do not let him see that you are watching; mark
well where he goes!"
 </p><p>  The Bridge-shooter, delighted at the task, waited not a moment, but
rushing down, was out of the house, almost as soon as the stranger himself. Although scarcely a moment had elapsed, no one could he discover
near the place: the neighbours, since the abating of the storm, had gained
courage to re-enter their houses, no longer fearing theirs would share
the fate of the lantern-maker's; the Bridge was completely deserted, and
save the roaring of the waters, and the melancholy wailings of the wind,
no sound could be heard.  The Bridge-shooter listened for a footfall, to
direct him the way the stranger might have taken, but he listened in
vain.
 </p><p>  "Well," said the Bridge-shooter, " if we are not bewitched, no
mortals ever were, that I'll swear; the man, or devil, or whatever he was,
must have flown into the air, or sunk through the stones of the Bridge,
for I'll defy him to have vanished thus suddenly, by any more common
means." Having quite made up his mind, that the stranger was some
fiend in disguise, he felt it would be useless to continue the search further,
so hastened in doors again, and related his ill success to Edward, who,
upon hearing of the mysterious disappearance of the stranger, said-" It
has often struck me, that I must have been born under the influence of some
star of mystery; nothing ever occurs to me as to others; I always have
wished, and wish so still, to pass my life in quietude, and unpretending
obscurity; but do what 1 will, I cannot escape from falling into situations
the most mysterious, the most exaggerated; and now, it appears, that in
spite of myself, I am to be dragged into some more mysterious affair than
any yet; but to what end, or why I am thus selected, Heaven only
knows ! That knife too--"
 </p><p> " Are you sure it is a knife ?" said the Bridge-shooter, seizing
Edward's arm, to prevent him from touching it, " are you sure it is ?
It certainly looks like a knife, and one of not the newest fashion either.
Shall I throw it into water? if it is be-deviled 'twill swim--if an
honest knife 'twill sink: that's the way mother sometimes tries these
charmed things."
 </p><p> "Why, William," said Osborne, smiling, "you are surely growing
as superstitious as the good dame, your mother, herself: be-deviled!
nonsense-I fear not to touch it !" saying which, he took up the knife;
"it's but a common thing-an apprentice's old-fashioned dagger-knife,








                                           <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>

such as I used formerly to carry. These marks are not of rust," and he
looked closer at the blade; " they are more like old stains of blood !"
  </p><p> "Blood!" exclaimed the Bridge-shooter, poking his nose over the
knife; "and see," he continued, " the point has been broken off-and
hang me if that pattern running down the blade isn't-well, that would
be mysterious indeed !'
 </p><p> "What would be mysterious?" enquired Edward quickly, for he
saw, by William's manner, that his mind was fraught with some odd
notion.
 </p><p>  " Oh, nothing !" said the other, " only if it should be-wait a moment,
wait a moment-only you just wait a moment!"
 </p><p>  The Bridge-shooter seized a lamp, and Edward instantly heard him
lumbering and tumbling up the stairs, to the very top of the house; in
another minute he was heard tumbling down again, and as he hurried
into the room he exclaimed-" It is, I'll swear it is, before I try it ! See
here, master Edward, see here !" and he held up the broken piece of the
blade, against which Osborne, it may be remembered, had cut his foot,
and which the Bridge-shooter had kept ever since, for the purpose of
scratching out blots, or errors he made when writing ; he placed it at the
end of the knife, and to Edward's astonishment, it fitted so exactly, that
it was not possible to doubt the two parts having formerly been one.
 </p><p> " Here's another mystery," observed Osborne, " and one that I think
will baffle all our ingenuity to fathom. How little did I think, when I
cut my foot with that piece of the blade, that years after, the remaining
part would come thus strangely into my possession-and why ? this to
me seems the most mysterious of all the mysteries that have yet surrounded me !"
 </p><p> " I am not quite sure," replied the Bridge-shooter, " that this is so
mysterious as you think; in the first place, I have made up my mind
that the strange being who has just left us, notwithstanding his vanishing
so suddenly, is no wizard, but flesh and blood like ourselves. Do you
remember his asking me what I was staring at ? I'll tell you why I
stared. I dare say it never struck you as strange, that he should say-
'Oh, it's you, young gentleman !'-now it did me, for those were the
words, and the voice was the same, we heard beneath the Black Arch of
the Clink: the man of the arch, and the man of the knife are one, depend
upon it !"
 </p><p> " But granting this to be as you say, we have arrived, thereby, no
nearer to a solution of this strange occurrence !"
 </p><p> "Not much, to be sure !" replied the Bridge-shooter; " but still every
little is something; and when we put this and that together, we may
guess pretty easily whose knife that was : you found this piece sticking
in the floor of Horton's old room; the strange man tells you that the
other part possesses a charm, to bring Horton to the dust; you know it
to be such as 'prentices always carry; so to make a long story short, that
was Horton's: how it came into the stranger's hands, or why he has
placed it in yours, for the present we cannot know; but my firm belief
is--" and as the Bridge-shooter said this, he lowered his voice, and cast
an anxious look around the room, as if fearing some other ears might
catch the words-"yes, my firm belief is, that with that knife some







<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>                   .

dreadful secret act has been perpetrated, and that we are to be the instruments of bringing it to light."
 </p><p>  "No, no!" exclaimed Edward, slightly shuddering; "the horrid
suspicion that has crossed your mind, cannot be founded on truth.
Horton, I know, was ever vindictive, ever cruel, and cared not whom
he wronged to gratify his passions, or work out his revenge, but not to
the extent your words imply-you hint at murder !"
 </p><p>  " In what other way can that knife possess so monstrous a power
over him ? But, be it as it may, guard well that blood-stained blade, for
blood those stains are, I feel certain. In the morning I'll away to my
old mother, the Witch of Houndsditch, as the stranger called her, for
you remember he told us, what further was to be learnt, would be
through her; she'll make a rigmarole sort of story, and will tell me a
vast deal more than the truth, though I'll give the old soul the credit of
believing all she does say is true; I'll manage as well as I can to ferret
out something."
 </p><p> When the Bridge-shooter reached his mother's cottage, he approached
the casement to tap at it, as was his usual custom every morning, and
then to give her a kindly nod, before he entered the cottage door; but he
now checked his hand, for he fancied he saw a figure standing in the
room, resembling the stranger of the night before; he stepped cautiously
past the window, and approaching the door on tiptoe, intending to surprise the stranger, and, in his own mind determined, now it was daylight,
and all his superstitious fears having vanished, to come to an open explanation, and not let him again give him the slip, he raised the latch
without a sound, and darting in, became more amazed than ever, for not
a soul, but his old bed-ridden mother, was in the room.
 </p><p> "Where's the stranger ?" he exclaimed, looking round the apartment,
as if he still imagined he might be hidden under one of the chairs, or
some such impossible place.
 </p><p> " What stranger, boy?" said the old woman, who was evidently
agitated; "what stranger do you enquire after ? But methinks it had
been but dutiful of a son, to have enquired after his infirm old mother,
before thinking of strangers !"
 </p><p> "Forgive me, mother," said William; " but before I ask after aught
else, I will know who and what that man is who was here but now !"
As he said this, he attempted to open the door leading to a sort of kitchen,
it was locked-" Oh, oh," said he, " he's here, is he !" then running to
the back of the house, was equally unfortunate in his search, for no trace
of the stranger could he discover. " I'll swear I saw him standing here !"
lie said, as he again entered the room. " Come, mother, don't have your
witchery nonsense with me. Who was it ? and how has he eluded me ?"
 </p><p> "He !--who ?" enquired the old dame; " those that I have seen, you
could not see; and those that I have heard, even the stormy winds
would have prevented you from hearing; but I see with other eyes, and
hear with other ears than mortals do.  He has been with me again this
night !"
 </p><p> Whom mean you ?" enquired her son, now hoping he had fallen
upon the right scent.
 </p><p> " The murdered knight !" replied the old woman;  you'll hear more of








                                           <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>

 him anon; you'll hear more of him anon; and when you do, remember
 well that I have told you this !"
  </p><p> " But you've told me this old story so often, and nothing has come of
 it yet, that I'm getting tired of the murdered knight, and all connected
 with him. Why won't you tell me concerning what I want to know--
 who was it with you not five minutes ago ?"
  </p><p> " One of the many that have been with me in the night !"
  </p><p> "Pshaw !" said the Bridge-shooter, " but this is morning, and rather
 late in the morning too-far too late for spirits to be flitting about. But I
 see you won't speak upon the subject, and as that is the only subject
 I wish to be informed on, I'll leave you, and seek my information
 elsewhere."
  </p><p> " You'll find it nowhere else," replied his mother; " and to show you,
ungrateful, doubting boy, that I can read events to come, know that you
and Edward Osborne must hasten to the cottage on the Heath; you will
there find one you little dream of!"
  </p><p> " Not the murdered knight ?" said William, smiling ironically; "and
it can't be Flora, for I'm always dreaming of her-who can it be ?"
 </p><p>  " You would believe me as little were I to tell you, as you do now,"
said the mother, " so I will save my breath; but remember, that if Edward
would serve those he loves, he will be at the Heath this night.  Oh, I
could tell you a thousand things, but what would be the use of speaking
to a block. You will sleep in a strange bed this night!"
 </p><p>  " I say, mother, that's uncommonly old. I suppose next you'll tell
me I shall marry a fair girl."
 </p><p> " And so you will !" replied the old woman.
 </p><p> " That I shall," said William, " if I marry at all, for Flora's fair, and
I swear I'll never marry any one else. How many children shall we have,
eh, mother-seven girls, and seven boys ?"
 </p><p> The old woman made no reply, but gave her son a look of withering
contempt; and waving her hand, implied that he might leave her.
  </p><p>"Gad zooks !" exclaimed the Bridge-shooter, " why, I say, mother,
where's your spirit ?"
 </p><p> " My spirit !"
 </p><p> " Yes," said he, " your old cat-where is it ?"
 </p><p> "Gone to seek for your brains," said the old dame, quite crossly,
" gone to seek for your brains; and if she stay until she find them, I
shall never live to see her again !"
</p><p>  "Gad, mother, that's a good slap; but I deserve it; so give us a
kiss, and your blessing; and to shew you how implicitly I believe in all
you say, I'll get Edward to go with me to the Heath this very night.
I don't think it will take much trouble to tempt him; for, some how
or another, for the last few days, he has been doing nothing else but
talk about the Heath, and those upon it; and seems to be ever seeking
for some excuse for going there: but the merchant being away, you
know-,
 </p><p> " No matter," replied the old woman; "I'll take all blame, if my
words prove unsooth. But he and you are expected this night; and
let not Edward slight the summons I now send him to be there."
</p><p>  When the Bridge-shooter returned, he found Osborne sitting near a







<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>                   .

desk, with his head leaning against his hand, his eyes turned up
towards the heavens-in fact, he was sitting as authors are supposed
to sit, in moments of inspiration.  The noise of William's entrance
startled Edward, and he hurriedly concealed two or three little scraps
of paper.   The Bridge-shooter had more than once before, although
not until lately, noticed a like circumstance, yet never dreamt the
cause.
</p><p>  "Well, William," said young Osborne, putting on that studied
indifference which people mostly do when they are surprised in doing
something they feel slightly ashamed of; " well, what says the Witch
of Houndsditch, eh ?  Has she solved the difficulties of our surmises ?"
 </p><p> "Not one," was the Bridge-shooter's reply, "but has added new
surmises to our old ones; for can you-I can't, for the life of me-
surmise why we two should be expected at the Heath, and on this
very night too ?"
 </p><p> "At the Heath!" ejaculated Edward, with great eagerness; "and
who says we are expected there ?"
</p><p>  " Oh, nobody very particular," replied William, "only old mother:
but as I promised to deliver her message, why, I suppose I must.  She
says that if you would serve those you love, you will be at the Heath
to-night. But I suppose you won't go."
  </p><p>" Not go !" exclaimed Edward, starting up; "not go, if I can be
of service to her-that is to those I love; and whom do I love but
those on the Heath ?  Your mother has been too often right for me to
neglect her warnings now.
 </p><p>  "I can't say much for her being very often right-I've known her
a plaguy deal oftener wrong: but as she sometimes guesses within
a mile of the truth, perhaps she does so now, and as far as I'm concerned, a row, or a ride to Putney, would suit my longings vastly, for
Flora has returned, no doubt, by this."
 </p><p> " Yes, William, we'll away at once; if a service is to be performed,
the sooner it be done the better; a quick favour is a double favour;
besides, I myself have for some days past-yes, for several days, had
strange forebodings concerning the cottage on the Heath; an inward sort
of feeling that seemed to impel me to hasten thither, and see that all
was well. Heaven send it be so !"
 </p><p> As soon as the affairs of the merchant's shop could be put into sure
train, that their absence might cause no disarrangement of the business,
the two mounted their horses, and starting at a good round pace, were
soon far from London.
 </p><p> As they journeyed on, the Bridge-shooter, after a very long silence,
startled Edward, by saying-" Master Edward, were you ever in love ?"
 </p><p> " In love !" exclaimed Osborne, as though such a thought had never
once crossed his mind before, " in love ! do you think I'm a fool ?"
 </p><p> " I think any man's a fool that is not; it's the greatest blessing of my
life; if you were but once to taste the sweets of it, you'd find your
appetite increase with every morsel you swallowed; it's a perfect paradise; sometimes I could cut my throat with jealousy; at another time I
could drown myself in despair !"
 </p><p> " And these are the comforts you would recommend to poor me, eh ?-








                                           <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>

 No, no," said Edward; "no doubt that jealousy is a very keen blade,
 but I have no wish to cut my throat with it; nor to drown myself in the
 flood of despair."
 </p><p>  " Nor have I, really," said William, ' for the things themselves are
 unpleasant enough, no doubt; but then the delight is at being prevented by
 ner you love; and it is really astonishing to see how exactly they know
 the very moment to rush in and save you.   Then comes the sobbing,
 and the crying, and the forgiving, and the making it up, and swearing that you'll never quarrel again, and then quarrelling again ten
 minutes afterwards. Oh, it's wonderful! Why don't you fall in love ?"
 </p><p>  "Because," replied Edward, " I have never seen any one worth til
 trouble; or-- " he checked himself, " or, if I had, would think me worth
 the loving."
 </p><p>  "You've never tried," said the Bridge-shooter.
 </p><p>  " Nor ever mean, rejoined Edward; "for I am certain that were I silly
 enough to place my affections upon any one, I should do so upon the
 only being on earth that could never be mine. Heigho !"
  </p><p>  "Why, that 'heigho's' exactly like a lover's sigh," said William;
 " I know all the different sorts of sighs now ; that was a young one, just
 such as I used to give before Flora owned that she liked me."
 </p><p>  " But why," enquired Osborne, " why have you led the conversation into this unusual vein ? I think you have never talked to me thus
 before."
  </p><p>  No," replied the other, " but we've often wanted to.  I say we,
 for I mean Flora and I; bless you, Master Edward, we've a hundred
 and a hundred times talked about you; and if you won't be offended, I'll
tell you what we've said."
 </p><p>   Osborne could not help smiling at the earnestness with which the
 Bridge-shooter uttered these words, so the latter taking the smile for
 consent, went on.-" Well then, I have often and often said to Flora,
 what a pity it was, that Master Edward would never see what a charming creature young Mistress Anne was; and then Flora would say to me-
 'And it's quite as great a pity, that sweet Mistress Anne can't see what
 a charming young man Master Edward is ;'-upon my life, she says
 you are a charming young man; and would you believe it, I have never
 once been jealous when she has said so."
</p><p>    "I would not interrupt you, William," rejoined Edward, " until you
 had finished your absurd speech; for I knew it was kindly meant; but
 could you or Flora ever think me so weak, so mad-yes, mad, as to look
 upon my master's daughter with any eyes but those of a brother ?  Is it
 likely that he, now growing into one of the greatest, the wealthiest merchants, of this, the most wealthy city of the world, would give his child to
 his apprentice ? or that she, the daughter of such a man, could ever find in
 that apprentice, worth to make her abandon all her hopes of greatness ?
 Master Hewet, good as he is, is still as proud as he is good, and will no
 doubt follow the fashion of the times, and wed his rich daughter to some
 poor lord. It is the way with most of our great citizens nowadays ; then
 why should he act differently to them? Yes, yes, depend upon it, Anne,
 will one day become the wife of some worthless lordling !"  He pronounced the word worthless very bitterly; and then they rode on for

some time in silence. Edward, who had evidently been communing with
himself further upon the same theme, said suddenly, as though the
Bridge-shooter had been fully aware of what had been passing in his
mind--; It is to warn her upon this subject, I am so anxious to visit the
Heath.  This young artist, this Lerue, of whom I can learn nothing in
town, seems by her letter to be a likely swain, and should she fatally
become attached to him, her misery would be certain, for her father could
never consent to such a match as that; and thus would her future hopes
be blighted for ever: but I will warn her."
 </p><p> " If you would take my advice, Master Edward," said the Bridge-
shooter, " you'll do no such thing."
</p><p>  "No!" exclaimed Edward Osborne in surprise; "and why not, I
pray ?"
</p><p> "Because," replied the other, "it is a well-known fact in natural
history-and I have heard that no exception to the rule has yet been
discovered-that when you want a girl to do anything, always advise her
to the contrary, and she's sure to do it.  You see, young women
are born with very strong notions of justice; so that the moment a
young man is traduced, up pops their justice, with magnifying glasses
upon his nose, and begins to search about, to find out every little bit of
good there may be in him.  Now, as everybody has some good, if we
will but look for it-and as they look for nothing else-why, they soon find
what they think enough to upset the truth of all your warnings; and
thus, you see, you have led to your own defeat.  No, no; when you do
not wish people to care for each other, leave them alone. Why is Cupid
always drawn with a bow and arrow?  Why, to show that he delights
in opposition, and glories in wounding those who attempt to resist him.
Had Anne and you been told that on no account must you love each
other, hang me if I don't think you would have been married by this
time !"
 </p><p> Osborne could not help feeling there was some little truth in the
Bridge-shooter's remarks upon the perversity of human nature, for he inwardly acknowledged that ever since he had told himself he must not
think of Anne, he had thought of nothing else. His mind now took so
sad a turn, yet still bearing upon the same forbidden point, that they
passed over more than a mile without exchanging another word.
 </p><p> It is quite extraordinary to observe how easily, at times, the most determined resolution may be turned aside by a mere chance word, a look,
or even a stifled sigh; here was poor Osborne-who had started for the
Cottage of the Heath, not so much on account of the witch's summons,
as on that of a previously-formed resolution to annihilate at once every
hope that, he felt sure, Lerue was entertaining towards the lovely Anne:
yes, and to do it too, by the eloquence of his forewarning-the simple
remark of the Bridge-shooter, had thrown a doubt into his mind, regarding the wisdom of such a step, which doubt he found very difficult to
overcome. He worried himself greatly upon this question, and at last
determined, which was, taking all the circumstances into consideration, the wisest plan to pursue, that he would first reconnoitre the
enemy's lines, before he made up his mind as to the mode of attack. It

 was towards nightfall when they arrived at the Cottage; but the strange
 incidents that there took place we must reserve for a future chapter.

 </p><p>AFTER sitting for some time, with pen in hand, Lerue started up, as it
 a sudden determination had seized upon his mind; and pacing backwards and forwards several times, he exclaimed-- Yes, that will be
 some slight reparation--would to Heaven it could be more complete-but
 that is impossible ! It is ever useless to sigh for what we know sighs
 never can obtain; therefore, let me do the little good I am  still able to
 achieve, light as it will weigh against the heavy wrongs my silly vanity
 has caused me to heap upon that poor child.   Will she disclose to
 Anne her secret ? Heaven forbid ! Yet why should I say that? Would
 it not be better, were this infatuation of mine at once destroyed by
 any means ? I know my own weakness ; and while there be a chance
 of gaining a smile from the sweet eyes of the Beauty of the Heath,
 I shall never have courage to withstand the tempting lure. I'm a fool-
 in every way a fool! Why am I still here? What is the end I would
 attain ?-the hand of Dame Allen's daughter ? The thought were malness-and yet to give up the pursuit I feel to be impossible.  It is
 now certain that I must never see poor Lillia again.  I would have
 unloosed the tie between us with a gentler hand, but since fate has
 torn it thus ruthlessly asunder, so let it be; for it were less cruel now
 to allow the wound to heal, unaided but by time, than to add new
 tortures in probing it afresh, merely for the sake of proving our art in
 causing that wound at length to be less seen."
</p><p> Lerue, again taking up his pen, wrote to Dame Allen, an excuse for
 not returning to the cottage, business of importance having called him
 to London; this he did, hoping that by the time he should again visit
 the Heath, that Lillia would have so far recovered as to be away from
 the cottage.
 </p><p>Having dispatched  this letter, he ordered a horse to be brought
 immediately, and at once hurried away to put his newly-formed scheme
 into execution.  What that scheme was, time will develope.  When
 Lerue reached Southwark, he dismounted at the Tabard-the Inn
 immortalized by <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>, a portion of which still exists; and here
 he left the horse, and then hastened on foot towards the Bridge: feeling
 somewhat athirst just as he was passing the Cardinal's Hat, he entered,
 and called for a tankard of ale, seating himself near a window that
 looked on to the Bridge.  His mind being full of his own thoughts, he
 did not for a time notice who were in the place, nor heed the subject
 they appeared to be in high dispute upon.  He was not long however
allowed to remain thus indifferent, for the sharp-nosed little arrow-





maker, placing himself exactly opposite to him, addressed him thus-.
Now, sir, I appeal to you, who being a stranger, as it were, that is,
not one of us, you can have no prejudices either for or against whatever
I say, or he says, or the other says-or what anybody says.  Now, sir,
I appeal to you-is it not a just law, a good law, a righteous law, a glorious law ?"
 </p><p>  "Before I decide," said Lerue, " I think it would be as well, as you
appear determined to constitute me judge of this worshipful court, that
you should first tell me what law you are alluding to ?"
  </p><p> " What law !" exclaimed half a dozen at once ; " what law, indeed !
why, what  law  be, but the new one to put a stop to begging !"
  </p><p> " I wonder," said the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker, " I wonder if it
will apply to wives; I hope it will, for my wife is always begging of me
to do something; for her, and if once I get her under the new law, won't
I make a slave of her, and wipe off old scores; she has made a slave of
me long enough, and"
 </p><p> " Silence in the court!" roared out Catchemayde; "silence ! or how
is the judge to hear the case ?"
 </p><p> " Yes, friend," said Lerue, "be silent, all but one, and let him speak
quickly, for ' hours fly, and so must I,' as the song saith: now to the
law."
  </p><p>" Well then, you know, that is, you will know when I tell you, that
vagabonds, and vagrants, and thieves, and beggars, but they are all one-
yes, beggars have so awfully increased of late, that our worthy governors
have just passed a righteous law to put 'em down !"
 </p><p> "That will indeed," observed Lerue, "be a righteous law ; for begging
speaks of poverty, and to obliterate poverty from any land, would indeed
be a righteous act !"
 </p><p> " Oh ! but it does not do away with poverty," observed one of the
opposite side; "no, no, it only punishes those, who are already punished
enough, I think, by being poor."
</p><p>  "And in what way does it punish them ?" enquired Lerue.
</p><p> " First, then," replied the little arrow-maker, who appeared to have
studied the new law deeply, " first, then, those who are found loitering
about for three days, are to be branded on the breast with a hot iron, and
made a slave of to the informer, for three years-"
 </p><p> " No, for two years !" exclaimed half a dozen.
</p><p>  "Well, then let it be two years," said the other; "but it ought to
have been three: perhaps I'm wrong, too, in saying that we may refuse
our slaves meat; and that we may make them work, by beating, chaining, or otherwise.  That word otherwise was a glorious thought, for in
fact, it leaves us to interpret it how we like, and make otherwise mean
anything we please. Secondly, if the slave run away for fourteen days,
and is caught, he is to be marked with a hot iron on the forehead, or
the ball of the cheek. I say, Catchemayde, mind I don't catch you; such
marking would spoil your beauty, eh ? and what would the fishmonger's
wife say then ?"
 </p><p> " Mind your own business," replied the other, " and proceed with the
question; for see, our worthy judge is nearly tired of your prosing !"
</p><p>  " Well, then," continued the arrow-maker, "and having been thus








                                         <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>

burnt, he is to be adjudged a slave to his master for ever; and should
he then attempt to escape, he is to suffer the death of a felon. Now,
I again ask, is that not a just law, a good law, a righteous law, a glorious
law ?"
</p><p>  " As far as I can understand it," rejoined Lerue, " it appears to me
to be a law, that must have been framed by a set of fiends, rather than
a body of Christian men !"
</p><p>  "Huzza ! huzza!" shouted the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker's opponents; "huzza ! the verdict is given ! And now, little sharp-nose,"
said Silkworm, " order in the sack; you're beaten, out-and-out beaten."
 </p><p> " Well," said the little arrow-maker, " I may be beaten, but I never
run, away, as some people did from the Clink: I never turn my back
upon any friend !"
 </p><p> " Don't you ?" was the reply of Catchemayde, as he winked to those
around; "don't you ? Well, I never had a friend turn his back so completely upon me, as you did when we were hung up to dry by the
Bishop's Birds.  Why, man, do what I would, I could not make you
face me!"
 </p><p> "Master Catchemayde," replied the other, ' there are certain circumstances in all men's lives, that had better be touched upon as lightly as
may be; or, may be, the sleeping lion may be aroused; and, may be-"
 </p><p>  Here the poor little arrow-maker was interrupted by a general roar of
laughter, and Lerue feeling but little interest in their dispute, threw
down a piece of money to discharge his reckoning, and was on the point
of quitting the place, when he fancied he saw some one in a dark corner
of the room, endeavouring to avoid his notice; had the man sat quietly,
Lerue would no doubt have passed out without recognising him ; but now
he at once walked straight to the spot, and exclaimed--" Nino !" The
man appeared to be confused at being found in such a place, rose, and
in Italian, uttered a few words to Lerue, who replying in the same
language, that what he said might not be understood by those around,
left the Cardinal's Hat, followed by him  whom he had addressed as
Nine.
 </p><p>  There was one other who also quitted the place, this was Spikely;
he had been for a long time before conversing with Nino, who was an
Italian Spikely had known abroad, and it was to meet Spikely, and renew
their former friendship, that Nino had then visited the Cardinal's Hat.
Spikely followed at some distance, but still near enough to perceive by
their gesticulations, that angry words were passing between Lerue and
his companion.  They soon quitted the Bridge, and turning down Swan
Lane, the former gave a packet to Nino, who entering a boat at the stairs,
departed towards the west; Lerue passing by the Steel Yard, was soon
out of sight. Spikely hurried down the stairs, and eyeing the various
boats and their rowers, pitched upon the one that appeared to him the
most lightly built, and had the strongest waterman aboard: he jumped
in, and was soon in the wake of the boat of Nino. When they arrived
opposite the Strand, which, at that time was adorned with the magnificent mansions and castles of the nobility, the gardens of which extended
to the water side, Spikely saw by the outstretched arm of Nino, that he
was pointing to, and was about to land at, the private stairs of one of these






<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>

mansions; he ordered his waterman to put out his strength, and thus
came alongside the other boat, just as it turned towards the landing
place.
</p><p>   Nino, although surprised to see his friend so near, did not appear at
all sorry he was there, so the boats coming the one on each side the stairs,
the two cronies stepped ashore exactly at the same moment.  They entered the beautiful grounds, and after a few words, implying that they
would meet again in a few minutes, Spikely made himself comfortable
in an alcove that overlooked the river, and Nino hastened towards
the castellated mansion.
 </p><p>  " So he is to arrive to-day!" said Spikely, speaking to himself;
 "luck  befriends me; I shall have merely to forge my bolts, and already,
 I perceive, I need not fear finding fools enough to shoot them for me.
 This Nino, this young Italian, may be turned to good account.  I like
 Italian rogues ; there's no mincing matters with them; they hate a man,
 and the stiletto tells their hate, and that saves bandying angry words,
 and ruffling one's passions. I have plenty of irons in the fire, so that it
 will be hard  indeed if Horton escape being burnt by some of them.
 Ha, ha ! I long to see Horton's look as I point to the wound in my throat,
 which he intended to have been my passport to another world! It is odd,
 that dare-devil as I am, I have succeeded so seldom in obtaining my
 revenge upon those who have wronged me !"
 </p><p>  Here he ceased speaking for a few minutes, and appeared to be making
some calculation, for with the forefinger of his right hand, he kept counting on the fingers of his left; and as he did this, he again spoke half
aloud.  " Yes, Horton, one; Osborne, two; the merchant, three; the
Bridge-shooter, four; Brassinjaw, five; the Cripple-no, I have wiped
him out of the list; but d---m  her, there's my wife-that makes the
six.  The first and the last shall feel my vengeance deepest; Horton
and Nan are my debtors; the rest must pay off old scores on my
brother's account. The shot I received in the head from Osborne, I could
forgive---"
 </p><p>  The shot he here alluded to, was that which had caused the deep
 indenture near the right side of the forehead, we before mentioned, as
 being found on the head of the stranger, who had visited Edward so
 mysteriously on the night of the great storm; that stranger was Spikely.
 How he had been wounded, and had obtained the blood-stained knife,
 may be thus explained.
 </p><p>  On the night Horton had endeavoured to regain the papers he had
 sewn in the old mattress of his bed, it may be remembered he had
 drawn out his knife to unrip the sacking, but his horror at looking upon
 it, so freshly stained by the gore of his victim, had caused him to throw
 it, as he believed he had done, into the river.  In casting it from  the
 window, it had struck against a projection, and had thus been precipitated perpendicularly into the boat where Spikely was waiting, and who
 perceiving what it was, it struck him at once, that at some future day
 such a thing might be turned to good account, so carefully concealed the
 dagger; and it was again to seek it, where he had deposited it for security, that he had met the apprentices under the Black Arch, and had
 recognised Osborne as their leader. After his first great quarrel with








                                           <pb id="p.271" n="271"/>

 Horton, he began to think, that could he himself obtain the coveted
 papers, he might make them not only aid his own fortunes, but act as a
 powerful engine of revenge; he knew they were still in their old hiding-
   place; and it was in his attempt to gain admittance by the same window,
that had so frequently been used by Horton, that young Osborne had
fired upon him; he fell into the boat; fortunately for him at that
moment, the rope by which he had fastened the boat, gave way; and the
   tide being now strong, the bark had darted through the bridge, in the
opposite direction, thus preventing Edward from  discovering any one
beneath.
</p><p>" Yes," he continued, " that shot I could forgive, but not my brother's
   death. No, no; that must be paid for early or late; when he has done
   my work against Horton, then young Master Osborne's own turn may
come, but not till then ; the same with Hewet, and the like with the
   Bridge-shooter; they must wait their turns. It is odd, that do what
 I will, I can gain no information concerning that hell-cat, Nan. She
 may be dead.  Well, if so, 'tis better perhaps. But this new law they
 talk of, might have worked for me gloriously.  If her father had been
 still alive, and I could have caught him by it, that would have been the
 way; for, strange to say, though Nan at times would beat the old devil
 herself, and act towards him as if in hate, the only way to touch her to
 the quick, was for others to ill use him.  I have often worked her up to
 madness by the kicks and cuffs I gave to him."
 </p><p>Hearing footsteps near, he rose, thinking it was Nino approaching,
 but immediately shrunk back again, and stood motionless. Close to his
retreat was a thick hedge, dividing that part of the grounds from the
  principal walk. So near to the hedge did the persons in the walk pass
  by, that he could plainly distinguish two voices; the one uttering words
  that seemed to have been formed in fashion's choicest mould; the other
  was of a cringing fawning tone, and fell upon Spikely's ear as one to
  which it had long been familiar.
   </p><p> As the speakers receded, Spikely crept from his concealment, and with
  stealthy steps followed the sound, endeavouring, through every little opening he found in the thick-set hedge, to discover who the speakers were; he
  was long disappointed, but at last he came to a part of the verdent barrier,
  through which he succeeded in obtaining a view of the speakers; the
  first he recognised as Baron Seymour, the Lord High Admiral of England;
  the other-could he believe his eyes ! he actually rubbed them again and
  again, as if doubting their truthfulness of vision; so surprised was he,
  that an involuntary exclamation burst from his lips, and he uttered the
  name of " Horton !"  The two speakers turned instantly at the sound,
  and might have made search for the intruder, had not Nino at the
  moment appeared.
   </p><p> It seemed to Spikely, who crouched to the earth, fearing he had
  betrayed himself, that the baron imagined it had been Nino who had
  spoken, for no further notice was taken.
   </p><p> The paper Lerue had given to Nino, was now placed in Seymour's
  hand, who dismissing Horton, for it was really he, broke the seal, and
  having perused the contents very rapidly, said, as if to himself--" It is







<pb id="p.272" n="272"/>                  .

but a poor favour to ask so humbly; but the Romanists know how to
lower their tone, when aught is to be gotten by it; and times, too, are
changed since Kate Howard was on the throne !" Then turning to Nino,
he continued, aloud--' The answer is-'tis granted ! An hour hence
let him be at Whitehall, where he will find the necessary document !"
Saying this, the Lord High Admiral moved on towards the mansion, and
Spikely being joined by his friend, the two entered one of the boats, and
rowed towards the Palace of Whitehall.
 </p><p> As they went along, Spikely observed to his companion, that Horton's
sudden appearance had not surprised him half so much as his being found
where he had just seen him.
 </p><p> " There is not much to surprise any one," replied Nino, "is there,
in finding a soldier of fortune, in such times as these, in such a place as
the abode of the Lord High Admiral ? and still less to be surprised at,
in his arriving a few hours before the time supposed ?"
 </p><p> " But what could he want with the Baron Seymour?  You know, as
well as I, Signior Nino, that no man ever does anything without a motive;
and if fools would remember that truism a little more, there would be a
vast deal less roguery consummated in this world."
 </p><p> 'The answer, I think," replied Nino, " is simple enough; Horton
having distinguished himself abroad in the Protestant cause, now the
Protestant cause is again floating upon the sunny tide of prosperity, returns, as hundreds of the Cromwellites will do, to seek employment, or
rather rewards, for what they will call their monstrous sacrifices in the
cause of truth: he wants employment, and he'll get it: and why should
he not ? Can you tell me of one governmentthroughout the world that does,
or ever did, or ever will exist, without the aid of scoundrels ?  No,
Master Spikely, no ! I'm an Italian, and our government, though wonderous holy in outward show, we all know to be most rotten at the core.
But what is yours ? Not a tithe the better! Look at your glorious
Cranmer, who swears to be a Papist, whilst a Protestant at heart, who
swears a life of celibacy, whilst all the while he has a wife, and children
too! Ha, ha! 'tis marvellous to see how men can be deceived; and
men, too, who are believed to have their skulls filled with something
more than pap. No, no, amico, while the wind blows in the quarter it
now does, Horton, the unscrupulous tool of Cromwell, may ask and
have!"
 </p><p> "A tool," said Spikely, " is an uncourteous term; and unscrupulous,
perhaps, as much so. I feel it, because I, too, you know, was Horton's
partner in those glorious times; and if he be worthy of reward, so am I;
and what he gets I'll share, or he get. nothing-that I swear !"
 </p><p> At this moment Spikely, who had worked himself up to a pitch of
something that approached enthusiasm, was dreadfully lowered in his
dignity, by observing Nino, instead of reciprocating in his feelings of
hatred to Horton, very coolly take from under his cloak a small mandolin, and as though he had gone upon the waters for no other purpose
than to serenade some fair enchantress, begin to sing a sweet Italian air.
They had stopped suddenly, just beneath a projecting window that stood
out from one of the buildings, or rather castles, that then adorned the




                      <pb id="p.273" n="273"/>

  Thames; the words he chanted were in the Italian language, but may
  be thus rendered into our mother tongue:-
     </p><p>                               I.
                   <quote rend="blockquote"><l>    Oh, tarry not ! oh, tarry not,

                         </l><l>That how I mourn thine absence, dear,
                         </l><l>Is told in every bitter sigh:
                         </l><l>Then why will love not bring thee here?
                         </l><l>He would, if thou hadst loved as I.
                  </l><l>Then tarry not; oh, tarry not,
                       Unless by thee I am forgot !</l></quote>
       <quote rend="blockquote"><l>   II.
                        </l><l>Oh, tarry not! oh, tarry not,
     </l><l>Unless, indeed, I am forgot!
                         </l><l>Nor fire, water, earth, nor air,

     </l><l>Unless, indeed, I am forgot!</l>
</quote></p><p>
 They remained listening for a few minutes, when Nino again repeated
 the last line in a louder tone-" Unless indeed I am forgot."
" Diavolo !" he exclaimed; " but it seems I really am forgot !"
"By whom ?" enquired Spikely.
    </p><p> "Oh ! a pretty little country-woman of my own," replied the other,
"whose wits are as sharp as her eyes, and whose fingers are as quick as
her tongue, and quite as snappish.  One more trial, and then we'll
  away."
 </p><p> He again trolled a verse of his serenade, and had just come to the
  concluding line, when a fair hand was seen thrust from the casement above
and from it fell-what ? a tender billet-doux ? No, but a silver cup!
  Nino immediately struck up a lively air, and sang something about a
lover's thanks to his mistress, for the favours she had bestowed, and the
  boat passed on.
 </p><p> Spikely, who had picked up the cup from the bottom  of the boat, examined it with the eye of a connoisseur, and exclaimed,-" Why, man,

  " It may be so, or the handywork of a tinker, for what I care," said
  Nino, "so that it be silver.  What ever its form now, 'twill soon
  change it, by the magic power of the furnace and the crucible; those
  arms upon it would tell a tale too plainly for me to feel quite safe
  while it was in my possession."
  </p><p>   " They are those of the Earl of Shrewsbury," said Spikely.
 </p><p>    "They are," replied the other; " and that was his mansion we have
 just left. Every week, mia bella there, drops love's offerings from yon
 casement, into the bark of her faithful gondolier.  I give her love, and
 she gives me whatever she can lay her hands on; she's worth her
 weight in gold to me, and may be of wonderous use to us in working out
 the plan we have formed.  It often puzzles me to account for the many
 failures we clever fellows meet with; is it not strange, how few of those

who live by their wits, and have talents to deceive the whole world,
should so seldom make a fortune by their labours? I'll swear that a
thousand times in my life, I have made my dupes bear me triumphantly
to the very threshold of Fortune's Temple, when all at once, bang comes
the door right in my face, and throws me back again, as far away as ever.
There's one thing I am determined upon, and that is, if this our glorious
scheme should fail, I'll no longer make my votive offerings at the shrine
of Mercury, that God of thieves, but will forswear the world, and at
once turn monk: it's the better trade of the two, I begin to think."
 </p><p> In a like strain they continued to converse until they reached the
Whitehall Stairs, where they landed, and at once bent their course towards that portion of the Palace appropriated to the offices, over which
the Lord High Admiral had controul.</p>

</p><p>EVENING had began to close her shutters against the day, when Edward
Osborne and the Bridge-shooter arrived at the Cottage on the Heath.
To their great astonishment, they found Alyce and her daughter as
much surprised at their arrival, as they themselves were at discovering their visit to the Heath so perfectly unlooked for.
 </p><p>  "Well, now," said the Bridge-shooter, " isn't this all of a piece with
old mother's wonderful witchcraft ?-' Tell Edward,' she said in her mysterious way, ' if he would serve those he loves, he will be at the Heath this
night !'-I knew it was all nonsense, but what whim she could have in
her head for sending us all this way, puzzles me vastly ; and then to tell
such an abominable story, as to say we were expected. Oh, yes, indeed
she did ! she said we were expected: I should like to know by whom."
 </p><p>  "Perhaps by Flora," said Anne, " for she returns to-night."
 </p><p>  "No, does she though !" exclaimed William, his face beaming with
perfect delight; "if that be the case, I'll forgive mother all her
nonsense."
  </p><p> " Why, Edward," exclaimed Anne, looking anxiously at young Osborne, "what ails you ? you have become suddenly pale as death-are
you ill ?"
  </p><p> "No, dear Anne," he replied; "but a pain darted, as it seemed,
through my heart, so sharp and sudden, that-- but it is gone now-
And, now tell me-but why do I ask, for I may guess I am sure-whose
drawings those are that so profusely adorn these walls ?"
 </p><p>  "Oh, they are the work of our new friend, our protector, the young
artist, Walter Lerue !"
 </p><p>  As she pronounced the name, Edward fixed his eyes upon her so intently, and with such a peculiar enquiring gaze, as though he would
through her eyes read her very heart, that an involuntary blush suffused







                                            <pb id="p.275" n="275"/>

her lovely face, rendering it, if possible, more lovely than before. What
did he wish to learn ? what did he fear to discover ? he scarcely knew;
but he certainly now regarded Anne with different eyes, with different
feelings to those of former days; there was in his breast a kind of jealous
sensation growing up, that caused him much pain, if she appeared to take
interest in aught that was unconnected with her former habits. The
blush had died, almost as soon as born, and had been called into existence
by feelings very, very different, to those poor Edward now seemed to delight in torturing his own breast with; Lerue had had no share in
her thoughts at that moment, while Osborne believed sincerely that she
was thinking of little else.
 </p><p> Now, in the most unconcerned manner, she began to expatiate largely
upon the beauties of each sketch, which she, one by one, brought to
the notice of Edward. It is astonishing through what a dim glass jealousy
looks upon the merits of any one regarded as a rival. At another time,
or had they been the work of another's hand, Edward would have been
the first to extol the great beauties, which these sketches undoubtedly
possessed; but now, the only parts his eye could rest upon with the
least feeling of satisfaction, were those wherein he believed he could
discover some blemish; not the most trivial fault that he could pick out,
but he magnified to such an extent, that ere long the faults appeared far
greater than the merits, and poor Anne began to feel a little ashamed of
having praised so highly, works that were so open to severe criticism.
When the likeness of Anne was placed beforehim, he actually burst into a
laugh of derision, and declared that he could not perceive one feature that
at all resembled the original.-" What !" he exclaimed, " that smile like
yours ?-those lips like little Anne's ?"
 </p><p> " But I am not little Anne now, Edward," said the young beauty;
" and perhaps my lips are different to what they were."
</p><p>  "They are different, very different," said Edward, gazing at his
young mistress with an expression she had never witnessed in him before;
" they are different, for they are more beautiful, a thousand times more
beautiful, than ever-"
</p><p>  Osborne's face burnt like fire, and he looked round at every body,
perfectly bewildered at his own unexpected burst of enthusiasm.
 </p><p> "Mother, mother !" exclaimed Anne, smiling more than ever kindly
upon Edward, "did you hear that ? Why, sober Edward has actually
become a flatterer. Well, I must be downright lovely, if Edward has
been able to discover a single beauty in this poor face; but up to this
moment I never imagined he was aware that I had either eyes, nose,
mouth, or lips. Why, Edward, if you go on at this rate, we shall have
you one of these days falling in love. I should like to see you in love !"
 </p><p> " Perhaps you will, sooner than you expect," said the Bridge-shooter,
very innocently; but the observation brought upon him a severe frown
from Edward, who said-" No one will ever see that day, for were I to
be so mad as to love, I would never be mad enough to show it-at least
until I knew I was loved as madly."
</p><p>" Then, I suppose, Edward," said Anne, "you will expect the fair one
to be the first to disclose her passion, and on her knees pray of Master
sober Edward to take pity on her sad condition, and to give her a little







<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>                     .

  bit of his carefully-guarded heart, just to keep her from despair. No,
  no, my dear brother, such a system will never do. Mother and I must
  give you some lessons ; she shall tell you how my dear father made love
  to her; and when you have learnt your first lesson, you shall repeat it
  to me; you know that I have a great deal of patience, so that you may
  go over and over again, every bit of it, without the least fear that I
  shall be tired; and when you are tolerable perfect, I will introduce you
  to the sweetest little wife-"
  </p><p>  "I think we had much better look over the rest of these drawings," interrupted Edward, " than talk such nonsense. But tell me," he continued,
 as he gazed in perfect admiration upon one he now took up, "know
 you whether this be the likeness of any living being, or the happy creation of the artist's fancy ? I never beheld a face through which the
 purity of the soul seemed so truly to beam forth, as it does in this."
    " Would you believe it," she replied, "but that innocent face really
 belongs to the very little wife I have just mentioned ? It is the likeness
 of Lillia, the Lilly of the Inn."
 </p><p>  " Poor girl !" observed Alyce; " I fear me she is too pure, and too
 innocent to be allowed by Heaven to remain long upon this wicked earth.
 Ever since the day on which Anne and Master Lerue found her in the
 ruins on the Heath, she has scarcely spoken, and there is such a fixed,
 such determined melancholy upon her mind, that at every moment is
 seems to be eating away her life. Her only prayer was to be taken to
 her father, but as he was from home, and knowing how much more care
 we could bestow upon her, than she possibly could receive from strangers
 at the Ferry, we insisted upon her remaining here until to-day, when
 knowing that her father would return ere night, no persuasion could
 prevail upon her to delay her departure."
 </p><p>  "From daybreak," said Anne, " she never ceased to pray of us to
take her home; so, as she had never quitted her bed since the day she
first came, we fitted up one of our vans with all sorts of furs, and everything we could find to keep away the cold, and in it, as she lay upon
her bed, we conveyed her to the Inn. I would have remained with her, but
she insisted upon my departure, as she wished, she said, to be quite alone
until her father came. It was with great reluctance I obeyed that wish,
but I will be with her again at earliest morn.  She has some secret
sorrow preying upon her mind, I am certain, but of what nature I cannot
guess; nor could I tempt her to disclose aught that might give me a clue
to discover any way of bringing relief to her wounded mind."
 </p><p>  Hearing this account of the Lilly of the Inn, Edward once more looked
upon the picture, and fancied he could trace through the sweet, but sad
expression of the countenance, the foreboding of an early grave.
 </p><p> Edward was now made acquainted with all they knew concerning
Lillia and her father, and he soon became deeply interested in their fates.
So intently were all their minds fixed upon the subject, that they were
not aware, until the moon had risen high in the heavens, and was sending
her bright rays through the casement as messengers, to tell them that
night was fast approaching, how long they had been talking upon the
melancholy theme.
 </p><p> Anne happening to raise her eyes towards the window, suddenly







                                           <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>

 uttered an exclamation of fear, that caused them all to start to their feet.
 " I am certain," she said," I saw a man looking in at the casement."
 </p><p>  "Did you, Mistress Anne ?" said the Bridge-shooter, starting towards
 it; "then I'll just ask him what he wants, and -"
 </p><p>  "No, no,-do not venture; it may he one of those desperate people
that are now so continually prowling about."
  </p><p> " If so," observed Edward, " I think the sooner we make him prowl
 somewhere else the better !"
 </p><p>  Saying this, and before Anne could prevent him, Edward at once flew to
the outer door, followed by the Bridge-shooter; when it was opened they
found a country lad standing before them; he was crying, and panting
for breath, and appeared exhausted with running.
 </p><p>  "Was it you who looked in at the window ?" enquired Edward, in
 an angry tone.
 </p><p>  "Hoiy ?" exclaimed the lad, "not holy, maister ! Hoiy know my
 place better nor that."
  </p><p> "Then did you observe any one else doing so, as you came up ?" said
the Bridge-shooter.
 </p><p>  " Hoiy ? not hoiy, maister !" again exclaimed the lad, as well as his
sobbing and his lack of breath would allow him; " hoiy seed no 'un
lookin in!"
  </p><p> "But why do we find you here?     What want you ?"    enquired
Edward.
 </p><p>  " Hoiy wants young missus; and my young missus wants her too !"
 </p><p>  " And who is your young missus ?' said the Bridge-shooter.
 </p><p>  Why, don't you know? 'gad hoiy thought every fool knowed my young
missus, bless her! It only shows that you're not a poor un, or you'd a
known my young missus, bless her! All the poor 'uns about these parts
knows maister's daughter, Lillia, bless her !"  Here he blubbered aloud.
 </p><p>  Anne recognising the voice of the lad, came to the door, and enquired
if Lillia had sent him.
 </p><p>  " No, not she," was his reply; "not she, bless her !"
 </p><p>  " Then who did ?" said Edward.
 </p><p>  "Moll, the milkmaid !" exclaimed the boy; "Moll sent hoiy; and
told holy to run loike mad up to the cottage; and so hoiy have run'd loike
mad: and mad we'll all run, if young missus dies, bless her!" Saying
this, he wiped his eyes with his arm, and blubbered afresh.
 </p><p>  "Heavens !" exclaimed Anne, "is Lillia then so very ill ?"
 </p><p>  "She's as bad as bad can be, bless her ! so Moll says, and Moll says,
that young missus says, that she wants you to come to her directly; and
hoiy'm to take care on you, down to the Ferry."
 </p><p> "No, my good lad, I have others to take care of me," said Anne; "so
do you run back again---"
 </p><p> "Loike mad ?" interrupted the boy.
 </p><p> "No, but as quickly as you can, and say that I will be there almost
as soon as you are."
 </p><p> " No you won't," said the lad; " for hoiy knows it'll do her good to
know that you're cummin, and hoiy'd run my legs off to do her good,
bless her!"
 </p><p> Without waiting another instant, the lad started off at the top of his







<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>                     .

speed, in seeming delight at what he considered the good news he was to
take to his young mistress.
  </p><p> A few minutes after, and Anne, with Edward, followed by the Bridge-
 shooter, was on her way towards the Ferry. The moon was shining so
 brightly, that all around seemed light as day.
 </p><p>  Moonlight has a peculiar power upon some persons, particularly upon
lovers; it seems to soften the heart, and bring on a pleasing sadness;
and if two young people should happen to find themselves walking together in its silvery light, ten to one but its supposed influence on the brain
begins to act, and if they are not already mad enough to be in love with
each other, they are pretty sure to be so before their walk is ended.
Edward and Anne had been walking rapidly for some time, and had not
yet uttered one word.
 </p><p>  " You are very thoughtful, Edward," said Anne, at last breaking the
silence; " and I noticed, the moment you came to the cottage, how sad
you looked; and I have also remarked that your last letters have
been little less sad then are your looks."
 </p><p>  "Why should I be sad, dear Anne ?" said Osborne, endeavouring to
speak cheerfully; "no man on earth, the world would say, has less
cause then I."
  </p><p> " But what say you ?" observed Anne; " the world seldom makes
just remarks; and none but those who suffer, can know the pangs of
hidden sorrow. You have always called me your sister, and I have
always loved you with a sister's love; then if there be aught that has
caused you pain, confide the truth to me; there is no greater comfort to
the human heart than that of sympathy; and where will you find a
heart that can more truly sympathize with yours, than mine?  Come,
Edward, tell me, tell me all, for something there is upon your mind that
robs it of repose. I have never kept a secret from you; then why should
you from me, if you are my own true brother ?"
</p><p>  " Dear Anne," said Osborne, " I do long to tell you part of what I
feel; and it was to do so that I now am here; but fearing the wisdom of
the step, I hesitate; because-"
 </p><p> As he said this he looked round to see that the Bridge-shooter was
not within hearing, for he felt his resolution tottering terribly.
 </p><p> " Because-and yet I know not why I hesitate, for what I would say
is for your happiness, so I will speak out, and then leave all to your own
discretion."
 </p><p> So seriously had Osborne said this, that Anne for a moment felt really
alarmed, not dreaming what could follow such a commencement.
 </p><p> " It is," said Edward, after a moment's pause, " it is concerning this
Master Walter Lerue, this young artist, that I would speak."
 </p><p> " In the name of goodness," exclaimed the lovely girl, " what of him ?
Surely he cannot in any way be the cause of your sadness ?"
 </p><p> " He is the sole cause," replied Osborne; " from all you have written
to me about him, it seems, as well as I can judge, that the attentions he
is so anxious to bestow upon you, spring from a warmer feeling than
that of suddenly-formed friendship; for Heaven's sake, dear Anne, be
guarded how you allow your thoughts to turn towards him !"








                         <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>

 </p><p>  "Why, Edward," exclaimed the astonished girl; "you are surely
jealous of Master Lerue !"
  </p><p> "Jealous !" Osborne said, with a kind of sneer; "why should I be
jealous ? Even were you really to love him, it could matter naught to
me, but to yourself would be certain misery; and it is to save you from
that, that I now warn you. You are the sole heiress of one of the
greatest merchants of our land-Lerue a stranger, and unknown-a poor
artist, no fitting match for you. Be sure of this, dear Anne, that to wed
you with such as he, your father never would consent."
 </p><p>  "My father will consent to give me to whom I like," said Anne,
proudly, "be he rich or poor, a prince or a beggar, or he gives no consent
at all. And do you, Edward, think so poorly of me, as to imagine that
poverty or wealth should sway me from, or to any man ? No, believe me,
it is my present thought never to wed at all; but when I do, I will seek
for my happiness in my husband's heart, not in his purse. Dear Edward," she continued, as she placed her hand kindly upon his arm, " if
that be all that has so much troubled you, set your mind at ease, for in
truth I am in but little danger from Master Lerue, unless, indeed, your
having placed him before my mind may cause me to discover some
hidden charms, that, but for you, I had never thought of looking for."
 </p><p>  The moment she said this, the Bridge-shooter's observation concerning
the perversity of the female mind recurred to him, and he began to feel
sorry he had drawn her attention so strongly upon the very man of whom
he would rather she should never think again. Fearing he had done more
harm than good, poor Osborne became more than ever thoughtful; and
Anne, too, for a time seemed lost in a reverie. She was the first to
speak; but before she did so, she looked kindly at her childhood's earliest
friend, and then, with a smile, said--" Edward, I know that every word
you have said, has sprung from the kindest, purest motives, and I thank
you-indeed I do; and if it will give you one moment's ease to hear me
make a promise, which I will never break, listen to me--"
 </p><p> They had just passed the end of a cross--road, and had not gone many
steps beyond, when exactly at the moment Anne was about to make
her pledge, they were caused to start, by hearing a female voice calling
loudly, " William! William ! William!"
 </p><p>  They turned round, and were very much surprised to see " William"
running towards a wagon that was just emerging from the cross-road,
and in another moment were still more surprised, to see a young woman,
jumping from it into William's arms. It was Flora, returning to the
cottage; she had caught sight of her lover as he passed the end of the
road, and was too much delighted at seeing him, to allow her to remain
quiet.
 </p><p>  " Well," she said, " that old gipsy must have been a witch, for she
told me I should find something precious at a cross-road."
 </p><p>  " And you found my precious self there," said the Bridge-shooter,
giving Flora a hearty embrace; "and now you shall go to the Ferry
with us."
  </p><p> " I can't," said Flora; " I've got all my things in the wagon, and I
must not leave them; so, lift me up again."







<pb id="p.280" n="280"/>                   ,

 </p><p>   Poor William looked terribly crest-fallen, to think that she was to go
 one way and he the other.
  </p><p>  Anne, guessing his feelings, insisted upon his accompanying Flora
 home, "being," as she said, " quite safe without more protection than
 what Edward could bestow."
 </p><p>  The Bridge-shooter did not wait to be pressed to return, but at once
 told the driver to push forward, and placing Flora's arm in his own, the
 two trudged on happily together behind the wagon--" in order," as he
 said, " to enjoy the beauty of the evening," but in reality, to have a
 little bit of comfortable chat unnoticed.
 </p><p>  As they strolled along, Flora said--' Now, who could have expected
 to see you here to-night."
 </p><p>  " That's exactly what we want to know," replied the Bridge-shooter:
 "mother sent us off to the heath on a wild-goose chase, after some one or
 other, whom, she said, was expecting us; and now we are here, we find
 we can't find any one that will confess we were expected at all. I say,
 Flora, I'm going to tell you something that will astonish your very eyebrows, and make them start right up to the top of your head."
 </p><p>  "You don't say so !" exclaimed Flora, really raising her eyebrows.
 </p><p>  " But I do, though," replied the Bridge-shooter. " What do you
think? I'm downright certain that Master Edward is in love at last!"
  </p><p> " Gracious " exclaimed Flora; " Master Edward in love, it can't
 be."
 </p><p>  " Can't it ?" said William, with a nod of the head; " can't it ? Do
you think I don't know all the symptoms by this time, eh ?  A young
fellow doesn't get pale for nothing-do you remember how pale I used
to be ? and he doesn't lose his appetite without eating, for nothing neither-don't you recollect what a little I used to eat ?"
 </p><p>  " I can't say I do," was Flora's reply.
 </p><p>  "Well, then," continued the Bridge-shooter, " Master Edward does
get pale-and Master Edward doesn't eat; and that's not half the
symptoms he shews-Master Edward is jealous."
  </p><p> " Jealous! of whom ?" said Flora; " perhaps it would be as well,
before you tell me that, just to let me into the secret of whom it is he
loves-but it can't be."
  </p><p> " I'll swear it !" replied William; " and he's very far gone too; but
not half so far as I'd have been gone, long before this, if I had been in
his place, for she is a duck! By-the-by, I wonder why, when we are
fond of any nice girl, we call her a duck ? I'm uncommon fond of ducks,
certainly, but I never saw one that ever put me in mind of you-ex-
cept, perhaps, a little in the walk."
 </p><p> " I'll box your ears, sir," said Flora, " if you are so ungallant again,
as to compare my walk to that of a duck's! I don't think ducks have
feet like these to walk upon," and out she held one of the prettiest little
feet ever seen.
 </p><p> " Only when they are such darling ducks as you !" replied the Bridge-
shooter, placing his arm round her little waist, and taking one of her
hands in his own; " and I am sure you will say she is, when you know
her to be our lovely young mistress, Anne !"
 </p><p> " You don't mean to say she has touched his insensible heart at last ?








                                          <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>

Well, I should be delighted were that true: but how did you discover
the fact ?"
 </p><p>  " By being in love myself," replied the Bridge-shooter; " having gone
through all the degrees-of seeing, admiring, fearing, being jealous;
and uncommonly jealous I know he is, though he keeps it to himself, of
a certain young painter, named Walter Lerue."
 </p><p> Upon this William recounted the whole affair of Lerue rescuing Alyce
and her daughter, and of his becoming a very frequent visitor at the cottage-and of what he had just heard regarding Lillia--" But," said he,
as he concluded his narrative, " the greatest proof of Master Edward
being in love is, that he has turned poet. Oh, dear! when a young man
begins to scribble poetry, depend upon it, his case is hopeless.  You
must know, amongst his waste papers, that are thrown aside for me to
burn, what should I see, one day, but half-a-sheet covered all over with
attempts at finding rhymes, such as-' heath, beneath; beneath, heath;
teeth--' he was evidently thinking of our cottage on the Heath, and,
may be, of Anne's lovely teeth: only this very morning my doubts were
rendered certainties, by finding this scrap of paper."
 </p><p> William took out a piece of paper from his pouch; but, brightly as
the moon was shining, Flora could not make out the words, further than
the title, which being in a larger hand, she could plainly decypher--
"THE DREAM OF LOVE."
  </p><p>" Really a very pretty conceit," observed Flora, " and I'll place it
under my pillow to-night; and who knows but it may bring me a dream
of love."
</p><p>  " You've got the reality," said William, "and that's a plaguy deal
better than any dream."
 </p><p> We must now leave them to pursue their idle chat on their way to
the cottage, while we once more join Edward and the lovely Anne.
</p><p>  They had now reached the Ferry-house; and leaving Osborne in the
room below, Anne ascended to the apartment of the drooping Lilly of
the Inn.
 </p><p> " Oh, bless you, dear Anne !" said Lillia, in a sweet but feeble voice,
as she raised herself slowly on her couch, to welcome her beloved young
friend; " oh, bless you, for this kind, this prompt attention to the
wishes of a poor miserable girl!"
 </p><p> " But why miserable, Lillia ?" said Anne, kissing the pale lips of the
sufferer; " why say miserable, when hope seems to have once more
dawned upon the fortunes of your father ? You know his present absence has been caused, so he informed you in his last letter, by having
found a friend where he could never have dreamt of finding one, who
will, he doubts not, be the means of his restoration to his former
station-then why this misery ?"
 </p><p> "It was to tell you why," replied Lillia, " that I have prayed your
toming hither-I am dying !"
 </p><p> " For Heaven's sake, talk not thus !" exclaimed Anne, taking the
burning hand of Lillia, and pressing it to her lips, " talk not thus:
there are many, many years, believe me, of happy life in store for you;
and doubtless the secret trouble that now appears to weigh you down,








<pb id="p.282" n="282"/>                   .

when I shall know the cause, will prove but the fleeting fancy of a
childish dream."
 </p><p> " It was a childish dream," replied Lillia, " but one that seemed so
real, its sad remembrance can never be again effaced from out my heart,
wherein it took its rise, until that heart shall cease to beat. 'Twill not
be long before 'tis still-its throbs already come slower, slower, and
fainter; and it is because I fear its little remaining life will pass away
before my poor father once more shall look upon his child, that I would
say to you all I had intended to have confessed to none but him.  Tell
him all, dear Anne, all I shall say to you! 'Twill kill him, Anne!
I feel my death will kill him !"  As she uttered these words, a flood of
tears burst from the fountains of her inmost heart, that seemed to choak
her.
</p><p>  Anne wept bitterly, too, but her anxiety to learn the cause of the
poor child's wretchedness, in the hope of bringing her relief; caused her
to exert her every power to appear composed, and as Lillia became for a
moment calm, she kindly pressed her at once to ease her mind of what
she wished to disclose.
</p><p>  Lillia gazing at Anne with a look of intense feeling, exclaimed-
"You, you are the cause !"
</p><p>  " I," exclaimed Anne, in a tone of perfect wonderment; " I the
cause of your sorrow ? Lillia, Lillia, you must be now, indeed, in a
childish dream !"
 </p><p> " No," replied the poor girl, " the dream is gone, and to you I owe
my waking.   Do not think that I have called you here to upbraid you
-Heaven forbid ! You knew not of the death-blight to my life, that
lay in those eyes now looking on me in kindliness and pity-you knew
not that their power, while giving life to another's hopes, was bringing
death to mine."
  </p><p>' You speak in riddles, Lillia, indeed you do," said Anne; " what
other mean you ?"
 </p><p> " Walter," replied Lillia, " Walter Lerue! I loved him, more than
my life I loved him, which my early death will prove."   Again she
burst into tears.
 </p><p> Anne now remembered the scene that had taken place in the ruins of
the chapel, the evident confusion that had seized upon Lerue, when first
he discovered the senseless form of Lillia lying on the earth; his precipitate retreat the moment Lillia had been conveyed to the cottage, and
his continued absence, while she was there.  The truth seemed at once
suddenly to flash upon her mind.
 </p><p> Lillia, now that the secret which had been devouring her very life was
once divulged, revealed to Anne her most inmost thoughts-she took all
blame from him-" Walter," she said, " had been kind to her, as he
would have been to any other child; but she herself had transformed
that kindness into a feeling, like that with which her own heart glowed
-she loved him, and she thought herself beloved."  The mist of overwrought affection had blinded her to the truth; that mist had been dispelled by what she had beheld in the ruined chapel-all the bright
fabrics her imagination had built up in her childish mind, had been, as
by the lightning's flash, shattered, never to be raised again.







                                           <pb id="p.283" n="283"/>

 </p><p> Anne having learnt the truth, endeavoured, by every means she
could devise, to raise a hope in Lillia's breast, feeling that hope was the
only medicine that ever cured the wounded mind. She told her truly
how indifferent Lerue was to herself; that with the one slight exception, all his acts to her had ever been but those of common courtesy.
</p><p>  The willing heart is easily persuaded, and for a moment a ray of hope
did light up the pale innocent features of that poor drooping lilly.
Lillia now endeavoured to deceive herself anew, by trying to believe
that she had been deceived in what she had seen  Her mind had become so weak from illness, that any picture placed before it seemed to
her reality: she clung to any hope held out to her. Suddenly she
started, as she exclaimed--" Hark ! hark ! oh, my longing ears deceive
me not this time ! 'Tis he! thank Heaven, 'tis he-it is my father !"
 </p><p> Anne could distinguish no sound; but Lillia insisted that she had
heard his voice.
</p><p>  The child was right, for in another instant the old man rushed into
the room, half frantic, and he threw his arms about his child, and kissed
her a thousand times.
</p><p>  Edward had, in the few moments the old man was below, told him,
as guardedly as he'could, of the sad condition of his child.
 </p><p> The old man scarcely heeded what he said, for he brought such happy news with him, that he felt that sorrow would never dare to visit
them again.
 </p><p> The little hope which Anne had raised in Lillia's breast, and the sudden appearance of her adored father, had caused such a glow to overspread her features, that no one then to have looked upon her, could have
dreamt that she and death would, ere long, become united.
 </p><p> Anne now took an affectionate leave of her suffering friend, and left
her with her father by her side, recounting all the happy chances that
had befallen him while away, and how his dearest hopes had been most
strangely consummated.
 </p><p> When Anne rejoined young Osborne, she found him sadder than ever,
--  Anne," he said, as they commenced their homeward journey, " I
have been thinking, what could have been the promise you were about
to make me, when we were interrupted by hearing Flora's voice calling
to William."
 </p><p> "I almost forget," said Anne.  " Of what were we talking ?-oh, I
remember now-it was about your fears for me, in case I should lose my
heart to Master Walter Lerue.  Be assured of this, that lose it when I
may, it will never be to him; and my promise would have been, and shall
be still, that the moment I have become silly enough to fall in love, you
shall be the first to know it-will that satisfy you, Edward ?"
 </p><p> As she was saying this, a sound fell upon their ears, as of one suffering great pain.  They were close to the little smithy, that had once
been the dwelling of Walter Cromwell, and in which his son, King
Henry's great favourite, Thomas Cromwell. afterwards Earl of Essex, had
worked as a blacksmith, when a boy.
 </p><p> "Down on your knees," said a gruff voice from within; "down on
your knees, while I rivet this iron ring round your neck ; and be thankful
to me for not doing it while it was red hot ?"







<pb id="p.284" n="284"/>                    .

   </p><p>They heard a violent blow, and then another cry of pain. The door
of the smithy being open, and the blazing fire of the forge within
showing every thing plainly that was passing in the smith's shop, they
could not help checking their steps for a moment, and gazing in. An old
man, whose back was towards them, was kneeling upon the ground;
near him stood a surly-looking fellow, whose dress and badge plainly
told that he was the tipstaff of the village. A gruff, elderly, but athletic,
Cyclops, for the smith had but one eye, was in the act of bending an iron
ring round the neck of the old man. Close to him stood a boy, holding
in one hand a square lump of iron, that was to act as a portable anvil;
and in the other a rivet and a hammer.
 </p><p>  "He won't be so fond of running away again,"- said the tipstaff,
" now he knows what it is to be branded upon the breast with a hot iron;
and I can tell you, my master, we did it pretty deep for you."
 </p><p> A shudder passed over the old man's frame as he thought of the dreadful pain he had that morning suffered, the wound still burning like a
fire on his chest.
 </p><p> " What can this mean ?" said Anne, as trembling she whispered into
Osborne's ear.
  </p><p> "I will enquire," replied Edward; "you step aside, for this is no
sight for you, dear Anne."
</p><p>  Anne moved on a few paces, and Osborne entered the smithy.
</p><p> " What are you doing to that old man ?" he said.
 </p><p> " What's that to you ?" was the smith's uncourteous reply ; " we are
doing what the law allows; and if you doubt it, read that !" Saying this,
he pointed to a dirty-looking bill that was nailed to the wall; it was a
copy of the law against vagrants.
</p><p>  " Oh ! it's all right, young sir," said the tipstaff; "this old scoundrel
would be begging, so honest Master Blaze, here, took him before his
worship, and had him assigned to him as a slave for two years; he is
branded on the breast; and if now he should run away, and absent himself for fourteen days-those are the words of the act-he will be branded
on the forehead, or the ball of the cheek, and then become the slave of
honest Master Blaze for ever."
 </p><p> "But that iron ring," said Edward; "surely the law does not allow
of that ?"
 </p><p> " Doesn't it ?" said the smith, with a laugh; "you shall see !" And he
began to hammer away at the rivet, as the boy held the lump of iron
beneath the ring; the jarring of the ring at every blow, caused great pain
to the old man, and he cried out for mercy.
</p><p>  " Will nothing tempt you to be more feeling ?" said Edward, his blood
rising with indignation, as much against the framers of such an inhuman
law, as against those who were now carrying its spirit into practice;
" will money buy your feeling, if you have any left to sell, which I own
I doubt ?"
</p><p>  "Money will buy anything in these times," replied the smith.
"What will you give, if I put him to nothing harder than blowing the
forge ? he'll only have to do it eighteen hours out of the twenty-four;
the other six he may sleep away in the ash-hole there beneath; it's a
snug and comfortable bed, young master, I can tell you."








                                         <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>

</p><p>   "Take all I have," said Edward, throwing down a leathern purse,
and give him as much of your humanity as you can, for the amount,"
 </p><p>  The smith took the purse, and weighing it in his hand seemed debating within himself what quantity he could afford to give; at last he said
--  Get up, old fool; but as the ring is on, why, there it must stay; take
the handle of the bellows, and to your work. Master Blaze is an honest
man, and having passed his word, he won't break it."
 </p><p>  The old man tottered towards the forge, and as he passed close to Edward, said-"God will bless you for this!" and then cast a look of
gratitude, so intense, that for a long time after Edward fancied he could
see the old man still before him.
 </p><p> Edward now left the smithy, and with Anne hurried on towards their
home. When they arrived at the cottage, they found the Bridge-shooter
awaiting them at the gate.
  </p><p>" Master Edward," said the Bridge-shooter, "were you ever surprised in your life ? but if you were not, you will be now. Who's the
last person you would ever expect to find beneath this roof ?-But you'd
never guess; no, never-that you could not ! So come in, but mind you
don't fall down with wonder!"
 </p><p>  When Osborne entered the room, he certainly was surprised; he stood
for a moment motionless, as if doubting his own vision, for there he
beheld not only his master, whom he believed to be in Holland, but also
the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-tower, and by him the blind Eoline.
  </p><p> "It's many a day since we have met," said the Cripple, addressing
Osborne; "and many a night, since that on which we said adieu by
the water-side!"
</p><p>   "But day nor night," said Eoline, with her lovely voice, " but day nor
night has ever passed, without our offering up a prayer for him, to whom
we owed our safety, and our lives."
 </p><p> Anne, who had so often heard of the Blind Beauty of the Minories, was
greatly interested now she saw her.  The contrast between the Cripple
and his wife was so striking, that she kept looking from one to the other
in wonder.
 </p><p>  In order to explain how the Cripple could possibly be found beneath
the roof of Master Hewet, we must take the reader back to the night of
the storm. When the merchant and his brave companions had approached
as near as they dared to the fatal sands, they plainly saw that there were
at least two persons upon them still alive : more than one, they also
saw lying as if dead. The breakers against the sands were so frightful,
that it was hopeless to attempt to run the boat nearer. At last it struck
the merchant, that by tying one of the stones that lay in the bottom of
the boat as ballast, to the end of a long rope, they might succeed in
throwing one end to those in peril.  After several failures, they at
last accomplished their aim ; the end with the stone attached to it, was
seized by some one on the sands, and they could observe that he was,
apparently, fastening it round the body of another.  They presently
saw him stand erect and extend both his arms, which they took for a
signal to haul in the rope : this they did as rapidly as they could, for they
knew that to it was fastened a human being-half dead with fear and
cold; half drowned by being drawn so far through the waves, a female








<pb id="p.286" n="286"/>                    .

was at last safely got into the boat.  Not a moment was lost in again
casting the rope to the sands, and again they succeeded in saving another
helpless being from a watery grave. lt was useless to persevere further, for
they understood from him they had just saved, that all else had perished.
  </p><p> So imperfect was the light of the breaking day, so altered by iear and
suffering were those they had rescued, that it was not until they
were once again safe in the ship, that the merchant recognised in the
man, the Cripple-of-the-bridge, and in the helpless female, the blind
Eoline.
 </p><p>  The merchant, when the sufferers were somewhat recovered, was still
more anih astonished at the Cripple falling on his knees before him, and asking
his pardon, and blessing him for saving more than life to him, his
adored Eoline. They had journeyed at once, after landing on the Sussex
shore, towards the Heath-Eoline conveyed in a litter, borne along by two
horses; the merchant and the Cripple walking the greater part of the
way on foot, on either side of the litter.
 </p><p>  There being strong reasons why the Cripple should not l.e supposed as
yet in England, or that he was even alive, the merchant kept to the
north of London; but wishing Edward to be at the Heath that night,
he had called on his way at the cottage of the Bridge-shooter's mother,
where he left the message for Osborne.
  </p><p> When the Bridge-shooter heard this, he exclaimed- There, now! I
knew it would all come out.  Is it not strange, that she will do nothing
without mixing up her magical nonsense with it ? It does not seem now
very wonderful-does it ?-that she should have known that we were
expected here to-night ?"
  </p><p> The merchant was again commencing his narrative, and explaining
that the feeble state of Eoline had caused them to pause on their journey, for some hours, and this had made them arrive so long after the
time they had expected to be at the cottage.-" But we have more
wonders yet to tell," said the merchant; " have we not, Willy-of-the-
bridge ?"
 </p><p> The Cripple nodded his head in assent; when who should be announced but Walter Lerue !
  </p><p> "    I am right glad he has come," said the merchant; " for now I can
thank him heartily for saving you, my Alyce dear, and my no less daring child.
  </p><p> " You will be charmed with him,' replied Alyce, " he is so clever,
so amiable and Anne says, so handsome: between ourselves, I think
she is half in love with him."
 </p><p> Osborne, upon hearing this, notwithstanding Anne's assertion of Lerue
being perfectly indifferent to her, felt a pang at his heart he had never
experienced before he looked at her reproachfully, but she observed him
not: the name of Lerue had called up to her mind the whole melancholy scene she had so lately witnessed at the Ferry: she had formed her
own ideas regarding Lerue, and those were greatly at variance with poor
Lillia's. When Lerue entered, he was, for a moment, greatly confused
at finding so many persons where he had expected and hoped to have
found but two.  The merchant waited not for any introduction, but taking him cordially by the hand, first thanked him for the service he had








                                          <pb id="p.287" n="287"/>

rendered his wife and child, and then gave him a hearty welcome to the
cottage. Anne, in spite of her endeavours to appear as usual, could not
cast off a feeling of restraint, which the knowledge she had that night
gained from the pale lips of Lillia, would force upon her. Osborne sat
moodily in one corner, and became more moody the instant he observed
the handsome appearance and superior style of bearing which belonged
to Walter Lerue.   The moment Flora cast her eyes upon him, she
whispered to William--" I am sure I have seen that face before, or one
so like it, that it seems to me the same. Do you know any one like this
Master Lerue, William ?"
 </p><p> The Bridge-shooter, eyeing Lerue from head to foot, declared he had
never seen any one at all resembling him.
 </p><p> Walter had placed himself between Alyce and the merchant, and
appeared to be in deep converse with them; but if one might judge by
eyes, his thoughts were in an opposite direction, in fact, exactly where
Anne was sitting, for at every moment his eyes were cast upon her
lovely face, as if to catch her own, and by their soft expression, learn
her approval of his admiration.
 </p><p> The more Flora examined the features of Lerue, the more convinced
was she that they had met before.
 </p><p> " Master Edward," she said, " I want to try a bit of the witch's
trade-lend me your ring, will you, for a minute ?  Conjurors always
borrow a ring."
 </p><p> Edward, without taking his eyes off Anne, removed the ring from
his finger, and gave it to Flora.
</p><p>  " Now you shall see," she said again, whispering to the Bridge-
shooter, " which is the greatest witch, your mother or I."
</p><p>  Taking an opportunity of crossing the room to assist Eoline, as she was
returning she  suddenly stopped, and stooping to the ground as if to pick
up something, on again rising, she presented the ring to Lerue, saying-
" I have found a ring, which I think, sir, must have belonged to you."
</p><p>  Lerue, the moment he had glanced upon it, blushed, and then became
suddenly pale-" It is not mine," he said, and then turned away his
head to avoid the fixed gaze of Flora.
</p><p>  " How silly I must be, to be sure," said Flora, still looking at Lerue,
'how silly not to know that this ring is the one Lord George Talbot gave
to Edward Osborne, there, some years ago."  She then returned the ring
to Edward, who had been so engrossed by his own thoughts, which more
and more took the form of jealousy, that he had scarcely heeded either
the actions or the words of Flora.-" I am right," she said, softly to the
Bridge-shooter, as she again seated herself by him; " but we must keep
the secret for the present."
 </p><p> "I am  sure I shall," replied the Bridge-shooter, " for I don't know
what it is."
 </p><p> " But you shall," said Flora, "but mind-your finger on your lip, or
we may make mischief here."  Then in a still softer tone she whispered,
"Lerue, as lie is called, is not Lerue, but the heir to the Earl of
Shrewsbury."
</p><p>  The Bridge-shooter raised his eyebrows until they were nearly lost
under his hair,







<pb id="p.288" n="288"/>                   .

 </p><p>  "'Egad ! and now I look again," replied the Bridge-shooter, " it is the
very fellow that made me so jealous when first I loved you. But why
is he here in disguise ?"
</p><p>   " Hush !" ejaculated Flora, "hush, be cautious !"
</p><p>   When all was hurriedly made ready for the accommodation of Eoline
and the Cripple, they arose, and Lerue, taking advantage of the opportunity, bade a quick adieu, and left the room. As he went out he
gave Flora a peculiar look, which she guessing the meaning of, said-
"I'll lock the outer gate, William !" and without waiting a reply, followed Lerue.
 </p><p> When they were out of the house, he turned to Flora, and said-"You
know me !"
 </p><p> " I do !" she replied. " But why is Lord Talbot here under a false
name ?"
 </p><p> "For the same reason, perhaps," retorted the young lord, "that
Master William  Hewet takes the name of Allen. I was not long in
his presence before I recognised the king's rich merchant. Keep my secret," he continued, "and your reward shall not be stinted: as earnest,
take this gold !"
 </p><p> " I want not gold," said Flora: " I have a treasure within more precious far than gold."
  </p><p> " Indeed ! what is that ?"
  </p><p> " My young mistress's fame !" As she uttered these words, she closed
the gate, and hurried into the cottage.
 </p><p> Lerue, for so we shall call him for the present, was about to take the
way to the Ferry; but, checking himself, he turned the contrary way,
towards the other side of the heath.  The strange meeting with those
lie had encountered that night perplexed him terribly.-" That stupid
girl will spoil all! But why should I dread the disclosure?  He who
is to be the Earl of Shrewsbury cannot marry a clothier's daughter; and
why this continued folly ?  To-morrow I will at once to town; and
now I am again reconciled to my father, will endeavour, by gaiety and
courtly pleasures, to forget the Beauty of the Heath."
  </p><p>The next morning he set about fulfilling his new formed plans. Wishing
to go to Whitehall, he determined to do so by water, and therefore hastened by a rather circuitous route down to the Ferry. He had done this
to avoid the cottage, and also that he might not pass the Ferry-house;
but, by mistake, he had entered a lane which brought him right in front
of poor Lillia's abode.  Upon looking up, he started; for, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, the whole was closed, as though death lay
therein. He hurried past, and, seeing a country lad, he asked if any
one were dead at the Ferry-house.
 </p><p> "Dead, yes, maister-alas, there is !"
 </p><p> "And who is it, my good lad ?" said Lerue, dreading, he knew not
why, the answer the boy might give.
 </p><p> "Why, my poor dear young missus !-Ho, ho, ho! Yes, she's
dead, and we shall never see her agin, bless her! Did you ever see my
young missus, sir-little Lillia?  She's dead, and I wish I was too,
bless her!"
 </p><p> Lerue threw a piece of money to the boy, and hurried to the boat.







                                        <pb id="p.289" n="289"/>

 </p><p>  As he proceeded on his way towards London, that great emporium of
 wealth, of poverty, of virtue, and of vice, he gave way to deep despondency. Lerue possessed a mind strong in feeling, but weak in resolution,
 and he knew it.  He could not, do what he would, shut out from his
 mind's eye the little ostlery of the Ferry, now closed, as it were, by the
 hand of death; the walls appeared to his imagination to be transparent,
 through which he saw, as in a vision, the withered blossom lying on her
 couch of death-the old man's grief-the father's deep despair.  "And
 this is the work of my own vain folly," he said, and then heaved a bitter
 sigh; " poor child! she was too pure to inhabit a world like this, and
 Heaven, in pity, has taken her to its blest abode; but would to heaven I had
 been spared the pain of being the executioner of fate's mysterious
 decrees !"
  </p><p> Not a word, not a look, not an act of poor Lillia's since he had
known her, but now rose up again like ghosts passing o'er memory's
glass. At one moment he thought he would return, and give what consolation he could to the bereaved father, but his courage failed him, and
he still went on. Had he returned, he would have beheld a scene very
like to the one he had been picturing to his mind ; for there, indeed, lay
the withered blossom on her couch of death; there truly was the old
man in his grief, the father in his deep despair.
 </p><p>  How differently had that night ended to the way the old man had expected it would have done. He had returned with a heart filled with
hope and joy, for he thought the news he brought would have filled with
hope and joy poor Lillia's heart; but, alas : that very news gave the last
blow to the frail stem on which her life rested-it snapped, and the blossom
fell withered-dead!
  </p><p> The moment Anne had left the old man with his child, he once more
took her in his arms, and kissed her fondly; he gazed at her sweet face;
the bloom upon her cheeks appeared to contradict the fears Osborne had
expressed; so with a joyous smile, he sat beside the bed, soon to be that
of death, and began to recount the unlooked-for success he had met
with in his application to the Court-" Oh, Lillia, how happy we shall
be !" said the old man to his child; "all my troubles, all my cares are
now for ever passed.  I am wealthy, Lillia, doubly wealthy, for I have
thee as well as gold. See here," he said, as he took forth some official
looking documents-" this is a deed that restores to me all my former
wealth; this is a commission in our pew king's service-this-but these
are things I can shew you to-morrow, dear, for now it is growing late,
and rest will do you far more good than the prattling of an old man's
tongue."
   </p><p>" No, do not leave me yet," said Lillia, " for I shall never sleep again
until I have told you a secret, father, the only one I have ever kept from
you. And now, if indeed we are rich-"      a blush came over her
features, for she thought of him she loved; the scene in the ruined
chapel rose up in her mind, and seemed to rob her of the little hope she
had been endeavouring to foster in her heart.  At last, after hesitating
more than once, she said--" It is of Walter Lerue-"
 </p><p>  " Walter Lerue !" exclaimed the old man, not waiting for Lillia to
 finish her sentence; "may Heaven's blessings light upon him ! Would






<pb id="p.290" n="290"/>                  .

  you believe it, Lillia, but it is true, dear child, that to Walter Lerue, the
  poor artist, who seemed scarcely able to pay the simple charges of our Inn,
  to him it is I owe all my present happiness. No friend had I to state
  my wrongs to those, by whom alone those wrongs could be redressed,
  and I was on the point of returning in despair, when suddenly I was
  summoned to the Palace of Whitehall; there I met my benefactor; he
  placed in my hands these papers-then hurried from me before I knew
  their worth-before I could offer him my thanks."
  </p><p>  When poor Lillia heard her father's words she burst into tears; for
 now hope once more took firm hold upon her heart; could he love
 another, and do all this for her poor father ? No; she must have been
 mistaken; her overwrought love must have blinded her reason; thus
 did she think, and for a moment she was happy.
   </p><p> " But stranger than all," said the old man, "was the discovery I soon
 after made; for I found that this same Walter Lerue was no other but the
 heir to the great Earl of Shrewsbury, young Lord George Talbot. What
 ails you, child ?" exclaimed the father; "heavens, your face has become
 deadly pale ! Speak, speak, Lillia, Lillia, speak !" He clasped her in his
 arms; she made several efforts as if to find something that lay near her
 heart; she drew forth her hand, and flung from it a flower-it was Lerue's
 first offering, and had ever since been treasured in her breast. She made
 two or three convulsive efforts to throw her arms round her father's neck-.
 one deep-drawn sigh that seemed as though it was her soul taking its
 flight to Heaven-and she was dead!</p>

</p><p>WHEN Flora returned to the parlour, she found the merchant and Alyce
ying with each other in praise of Lerue.   Alyce looked upon him as
being so remarkably clever, so amiable, and above all so handsome; the
merchant was principally taken by his superior bearing, and extraordinary
openness of manner; he said-" I do declare so open is he, that were he
to put a mask on his face, I should be able to see through it."
</p><p>   Flora, as may be supposed, upon hearing this, gave the Bridge-shooter
a sly look, and said--" Most men, I've been told, master, wear a disguise
of some sort all through their lives, although they wear no masks; and
keep their true feelings hid from the world, by clothing them in a thick
veil of false words."
  </p><p> " Heyday !" exclaimed the merchant; "why, Flora, you surely have
been studying philosophy of the old woman, your aunt, eh ?"
 </p><p>  "There's many an old woman," replied Flora, "a better philosopher

than you men, and can see much quicker through a millstone, than any
of the proud lords of the creation can; common sense and a quick eye,
make the best philosopher, whether in man or maid, old or young."
 </p><p> "Well," replied the merchant, laughing, " as I know you possess both
those great requisites, in an eminent degree, and as my eye is only
quick in detecting a rogue when he would give me a yard for an ell of broadcloth, and as I have but just sufficient common sense to know that
honesty is the best policy, I think the most philosophical thing I can do,
will be, instead of continuing a combat in which I know I shall be beaten,
to cry you mercy, my petticoat philosopher, and go to sleep; an art in
which I am a great proficient."
 </p><p> As the rest of the family retired, Flora and the Bridge-shooter made
an excuse, something about wishing to put the place a little in order
before they went to rest, and then, being alone, the two drew their seats
up close to the bright wood fire, that was sparkling and cracking joyously
upon the hearth, and began to discuss matters both private and public,
not only as regarded themselves, but, also, such as pertained to those
around them.  The first subject upon which they both appeared equally
anxious to enter, was that in which Lerue held a most conspicuous
place.
</p><p>  "Oh, you men, you men !" said Flora, shaking her head at the Bridge-
shooter, and then letting her eyes fall sadly upon the hearth, as if in
deep reflection; "heigho, heigho, heigho !-you're all alike-you're all
alike-I'm afraid, you're all alike!" and down went her eyes a second
time.
 </p><p> The Bridge-shooter for a moment looked quite amazed, for he could
not guess why she should shake her head at him, or why she should say
he was like every other man, when she had so often told him, that in
her eyes, no other man in the world was ever like him. So, not knowing
exactly what to say, he allowed his arm to creep gently round her waist,
which act she seemed to be perfectly unconscious of, and then taking
one of her hands in his, let his eyes fall in the same direction as hers,
and remained silent.  Presently, they both leant slowly forward, their
two heads nearly touching, they mutually inspected something lying
amongst the burnt embers upon the hearth; then again rising-" It
certainly is," said Flora.
 </p><p> "I was thinking so myself," replied the Bridge-shooter, and down
went their heads again for a second examination.
</p><p>  Flora, possessing, as she certainly did, a very pretty little foot, naturally employed the said pretty little foot to poke about the ashes, and
the Bridge-shooter as naturally caught hold of the pretty little foot with
his hand, to prevent her burning herself; having placed this pretty little
foot quite out of danger, he caught up the cause of their wonder, but it
proving rather hot, he let it go again, observing that " a fool would have
burnt his fingers ;" having made this assertion, his pride would not allow
him to confess how much his own smarted. Taking an old-fashioned pair
of tongs, which, by-the-by, were new fashioned then, he lifted the
glittering prize upon the table.
 </p><p> I could have sworn it was," said Flora.
 </p><p> "And so could I," rejoined the Bridge-shooter.







<pb id="p.292" n="292"/>

  </p><p>"It sparkled so," continued she.
 </p><p> "That's what made me notice it at first," replied he.
 </p><p> Then both again putting their heads close together, and their noses
almost upon the object that lay before them-" Why, it's a costly jewel !"
exclaimed Flora, taking up the magnificent bauble; when after examining it for scarcely a moment, her teeth began to chatter in her head, and
seizing William's arm with a strong, but trembling grasp, she pushed
away the jewel with her other hand, and muttered, in a subdued tone,
"she said we should hear more of him anon."
 </p><p> " Who said so ?" enquired the Bridge-shooter, quite alarmed at Flora's
strange manner; " and whom mean you by him ?"
 </p><p> "Your mother said it," replied Flora, her eyes riveted upon the
jewel; " your mother forewarned you, and by him, she meant-"
 </p><p> " The murdered knight !" chimed in William; "but what has that
trinket to do with him ?"
 </p><p> "'Twas his," replied Flora; "I should have remembered it amongst a
thousand. It was I who clasped it round the neck of our Mistress Alyce,
on the fatal day when I first guessed at the knight's false intentions.
But how could it have come here, and in yon fire too?"
 </p><p> " If it be really the same," said the Bridge-shooter, "it would, I
suppose, be uncharitable for us to imagine, that from where he may now
be, fire was the only agent he had at his command to send it by. But
you must be mistaken, Flora-I'm sure you must. Why, it is years since
you saw the real one, and then only for a day."
 </p><p> "But there were circumstances," replied Flora, " circumstances which
arose from out that sparkling gem, that caused too many a heart to
ache, for us soon to forget the cause; theft is the same, I am assured, or
it is a false semblance sent by the spirits of good or evil, for purposes, as
yet to us unknown."
 </p><p> The instant they allowed the idea of supernatural interference in
the business, and remembered that the original owner had met with a
bloody death, and then knowing the strange manner in which it had
suddenly been revealed to them in the flames, fear took possession of
both their hearts; they involuntarily clung together, the Bridge-
shooter flattering himself that it was merely to support, and give courage
to Flora; but in truth he was entirely subdued for the moment, by the
almost universal superstition of the times.
 </p><p> Fear we believe to be the most powerful and universal of all human
feelings; no one is exempt from it-no one can withstand its power:
the gentle lover, the steel-clad warrior, can be alike subdued by fear.
What was it that made our kings crawl grovelling in the dust, to hold
the stirrup, or to kiss the dirt from off the feet of some proud angry Pope,
but fear ?  They feared, poor simple souls, that he would shut the gates
of heaven against them, or open the gates of fire and thrust them in:
this, will be said, was superstition; but what is superstition but the
child of fear, and the most promising child of all his progeny? the
strongest sinews of the strongest man, are but as threads of glass, if
touched by fear's all powerful hand.  Its mode of action is like that of
the electric fluid-invisible ; but its effects, too, are like that-resistless.
 </p><p> They stood for a time, neither liking to confess that they feared to

   move, gazing upon the bauble : then both took a stealthy glance around
   the room, as though they half suspected the murdered knight lay lurking
   in some dark corner peeping at them, and ready to start up, if they
   dared to touch the mystic talisman, when the Bridge-shooter's eye fell
   upon a book, now becoming rather general in dwellings in England-it
   was the Bible; he pointed to it, and Flora, who was scarcely more advanced in her. state of reformation, than was the poor Bridge-shooter,
   started towards it, as a sure refuge against all evil spirits.  She opened
   it half-way, and placed it as a sort of roof over the sparkling jewel. So
   satisfied were they now of their own safety, that Flora almost smiled
   at her former apprehensions.
 </p><p>    " I think we are now secure from all ghosts or hobgoblins," she said;
   "but still the mysterious appearance of that brooch, in such a place as the
   cottage on the Heath, and coming in such a way, surrounded by flames,
   is very perplexing. I almost begin to suspect, William, that the Witch ot
   Houndsditch, although she is your mother, and may be mine one of these
days, is more of a witch than our unbelieving presumptuous minds have
 hitherto been willing to acknowledge."
    </p><p>  " Oh !" said William, in a most reassured tone of voice, as though
  the bare mention of his mother as a witch, had at once dispelled from
  his mind all ideas of witchcraft; "oh! if she has anything to do with
  it, believe me, we shall not be long in finding out the secret, and finding
  it out too, to be anything but supernatural." He peeped beneath the
  book-" It's there safe enough," he said; " and to show you how little
  I think of mother's witcheries, see here, I'm no longer afraid to
  touch it."
   </p><p>  Saying this, he lifted the book with his left hand, and took up the
 brooch with his right, exclaiming-" If thou be an imp of Satan come
 in the form of a diamond, and many an imp of Satan has come in that
 shape, this book will protect me; but if thou be a real diamond  -"
 Saying this he looked at it very closely, and suddenly changing his tone,
 said" And upon my life, Flora, it is uncommonly like a real one-
 isn't it ?"
  </p><p>  Flora, finding no harm had come to William, and not hearing any
  strange noises, such as moans and groans, or sobs or sighs, confessed it
  was; and further stated her still stronger belief, that that superb diamond
  was the very same, and no fairy gem, which Horton said he had found,
  but which really had been placed in his hands by Sir Filbut Fussy.
  The question now came-what should they do with it ? It might bring
  up painful recollections to their master, were they to show it to him, and
  still more painful memories should Alyce see it. So for the present,
  they determined to let Edward Osborne alone know of the treasure they
  had found, and then to act according to his advice.
 </p><p>   The mention of Edward's name, at once turned their thoughts into a
  different channel, so not feeling sleepy, and both having a great deal to
  say about him, and others in connexion with him, they once more drew
  their seats to the fire, and placing two or three extra logs of wood upon
  it, began a very cosy little chat.  There was one curious circumstance,
  scarcely perhaps worth the mentioning, but yet we will name it, and
  that was, that whenever the Bridge-shooter found himself alone near








<pb id="p.294" n="294"/>                    .

Flora, his arm always got round her waist; perhaps this is natural to
lovers; if so, we have no wish that either of them should be deemed unnatural-unkind we know they were not; so we will let them sit just
as they list, and merely relate what they said, without impertinently
noticing what they did.
 </p><p>  " By-the-by," observed the Bridge-shooter, " what were you thinking
of, Flora, when you just now said-' Oh, these men, these men !' and
shook your head at me ?"
  </p><p> "Thinking of," replied his fair-companion; "thinking of? why, of
you, and all the rest of your deceitful sex ; particularly of that masquerader, that pretended young painter, Master Lerue, or rather Lord Talbot:
how we are to act for the best in this affair, puzzles me vastly. It is
quite evident that Master Edward had no suspicion that the humble
artist was one of the first nobles of our land; and it's my present opinion
that we had better still leave him in ignorance; what think you ?"
  </p><p> Now as William always thought exactly as Flora did, the question was
quite superfluous on her part, for she already knew his answer before he
gave it; and as she had anticipated, he replied-- Why, Flora, upon
this subject I think exactly as you do: were we to tell all we know
to the merchant, he would be mighty wrath at the trick played off upon
him and his; the more so, because he would be without the power to
resent the insult; if we divulge the secret to Dame Alyce, it will drive
ner half frantic, from alarm for the safety of her child; and for more
reasons than one, our young mistress had better know nothing about it;
and as to Edward-whe--w !" and the Bridge-shooter gave a long
whistle; "heavens! that would end his business in a twinkling.
Already has this Lerue put the match pretty near to a hidden train,
reaching to a magazine stuffed with combustibles, that has long been
lying in Edward's heart; a step more, and the explosion would be awful.
No, no, let us wait, and, as mother beautifully expresses it, 'let us see
how the cat jumps,' before we move in this business."
 </p><p> " But are you sure ?" said Flora, as if still half doubting, " are you
quite sure, that sweet Mistress Anne has at last found a way to the
tender part of his stony heart ?"
 </p><p> "Sure," replied the other, "more than sure.  Where's that scrap
of paper I gave you? look at that; what further proof could any
reasonable being want ?"
 </p><p> 'While he was speaking, Flora drew from her bosom the piece of paper
the Bridge-shooter had given her in their ramble home, and which she intended to place under her pillow that night, in hope of calling up a " Dream
of Love."
 </p><p> " Look at it," said William; "don't you see it's poetry-poetry
When a child begins to write poetry, it may be because he has been born
a poet, but when a man begins to scribble rhymes, depend upon it he
has suddenly found a pen made out of one of Cupid's feathers. Read it
Flora-read it; and then judge for yourself whether or not Master
Edward is not uncommonly far gone."
 </p><p> Flora, after smoothing the paper with her hand upon her knee, began to
read--

 </p><p> " Well, what think you now ?" enquired the Bridge-shooter; " I say,
what think you now ?"
  </p><p>"Think," replied Flora, still looking at the lines, " why, I think if that
he wrote this, his case is perfectly desperate-i'faith I do, perfectly des
perate; and you imagine the cause of his sudden affliction, is our sweet
young mistress ?"
 </p><p> " Can there be a doubt," replied the other, " after what we saw tonight ? Did you ever see a dog chained up, watching another at liberty
and enjoying a delicate banquet, that looked more savagely envious than
did poor Edward, as he eyed the gay Lerue devouring the sweet smiles of
Anne ? I don't believe he has yet quite made a confident of even himself;
but love is a disease that will burst out somewhere or other, in spite of
all our care: he'll be obliged to tell her yet: I wonder what she'll say
when he does."
 </p><p> " Just what I said to you," said Flora, ' don't be a fool!' She'll perhaps put it in different words, but that's what she'll mean; for, alas! I fear
me that on her part, she has thought as little of Edward, as Edward
has hitherto appeared to do of her. If ever they should fall really in love
with one another, I wonder what the merchant would say; he's rather
high it his notions; and should the intentions of this Lord Talbot prove
more honest than I suspect them to be, would he, or would she, have
courage to say him nay ?"
 </p><p> " If I were Master Edward," said the Bridge-shooter, " I'd be before
hand with him, I know; for he ought to remember that at that little
shop called a young lady's heart, it's generally, ' first come first served ;'
and if he could only take all her stock of love off her hands, the next
comer might go elsewhere for what he wanted.      Is there no way we
could bring it about ? Couldn't you abuse him dreadfully to her; find







<pb id="p.296" n="296"/>

out all sorts of pretended faults; it's a seldom-failing method of making
young people discover all kinds of virtues"
 </p><p>   "I think the best thing we can do," observed Flora, giving herself a
 slight shake, " is to find out our way to rest; for if we continue to talk
 in this way, it will be morning before we say good night.  I'm very
 tired, but I have a thousand things to say, about the Cripple and Eoline,
 and I know not what; but for to-night, William, fare thee well !"
</p><p>    What else they said, or did, we do not feel bound to record, further
 than to say that the Bridge-shooter as he ascended to his room, muttered
 something to himself about-" He'd not stand it much longer; and if
 she liked him she ought to marry him; and that in the morning he would
 come to some fixed determination upon the subject-that he would !"
 </p><p>  Flora having carefully placed the song beneath her pillow, fell into a
 delightful dream of Love, and in it she fancied she saw Master Hewet in
 his barge on the Thames, dressed as Lord Mayor; and what appeared
 still grander in her eyes, there stood William magnificently attired in
 coat-and--badge, as Master of the Lord Mayor's barge.  She always
 regarded herself as a most fatal dreamer; time will shew whether or not
 her dream of this night became verified.
  </p><p> We must now fora moment glance into another apartment of the cottage,
that belonging to Edward Osborne; he had been sitting before the fire,
exactly over the very spot where Flora and the Bridge-shooter had been
conversing so long in the room below; and as they were thinking how
they could bring about a love affair between Osborne and the lovely Anne,
he was racking his mind to find out an escape from the snare he believed
he had constructed to catch himself--" Why have I now," he said,
"opened my eyes to all those matchless charms, against which I have
for years, nay, from her infancy, kept my heart from the knowledge of their excellence, by closing my soul's eyes.  Is it love ? is it
envy ? What is it that I feel now eating away my very mind ? Do what
I will; say what I will; think what I will; still there is the one
impulse to action-the one prompter of my words-the one engrossing
spirit of my every thought-and that one is Anne.  Why have I never
allowed such thoughts to invade my mind before? Was she less fair
before that upstart Lerue discovered her angelic grace ? was she less kind
before he--no-I cannot bear the thought that she has been kind to him.
She was always so to me; but then I valued not that kindness, because
I was fool enough to wait until a stranger should school me in the
knowledge of its inestimable worth; and now, like the spendthrift who
has squandered away all that might have brought him happiness for a
whole life, I feel, when perhaps it is too late, the bitter wretchedness of
my self-wrought poverty.   Am I deformed, unsightly, a fool, an idiot ?
It is no great stretch of vanity to say I'm none of these: then why
should not I have entered the lists, with at least as much courage to
combat for the prize as others will do, and, alas! I fear, that one has
already done. I watched them   both; his were the looks of a well-
practised, seldom-resisted profligate; he is one who has the courage to
ask; and to such, I fear me much, few are found who have the courage
to deny.  If then to ask is to have, why have my eyes never yet learned
the beggar's trade ?"







                                            <pb id="p.297" n="297"/>

  </p><p> Saying this, he turned his glance upon a mirror, but more quickly
turned away again, such a woful failure had he made, in an attempt to
look as languishingly as he fancied he had seen Lerue do, when gazing at
the lovely Anne.
 </p><p>  "No," he said, "practice may male deceit still more deceitful, but
 pever can make truth more true; and yet I feel, dead as these orbs are
 within their hollow graves, one glance from hers would kindle them to
 life ; and were but her heart to shine from out her eyes, oh, with what
 rapture would this poor heart fly through my own to meet it !"
</p><p>   Had Osborne gazed upon himself at that moment, he would have had
 no cause to have doubted his power of throwing his soul into his face.
 He had so wrought upon his own feelings, that he fancied for a moment
 that Anne was really near him, and heard the empassioned words he uttered. For her own peace of mind, unless she could willingly reciprocate his
 feelings, perhaps it was as well she was not there, for few tender hearts
 can resist true enthusiasm, at least, until reflection, with its icy hand
 withdraws the dazzling medium, through which such hearts have viewed
 the magic scene.
</p><p>   Poor Edward looked around the room; every object he there saw
 lowered him one more step from the exalted pinnacle on which, for an
 instant, he had set his thoughts. There stood his little bed half uncovered,
 inviting him to repose; there an icy ledger, bidding him turn over a new
 leaf, and think of business; the fire, too, began to wane and flicker.
 But dare we tell his last act of weakness, ere he sought repose ?-we will,
 for it was frought with kindness, if not with wisdom. The reader is
 aware, from a former visit to Osborne's sleeping-room, that there was
 but a slight partition between his own and Anne's dormitory. He knew
 her bed stood close against it-we almost blush to tell the simple fancy
 of his heart-but after a fervent prayer for her he no longer to himself
 attempted to deny he loved, he kissed the panel near which he knew her
 head was lying. Whether it were truth, or mere imagination, we know
 not, but he himself arose enraptured, for in his fancy that kiss had been
 answered by a sigh. Trifle as this was, it caused him to fall into a
 happier, far happier state of repose than he had enjoyed for nights and
 nights before.
</p><p>   Had the charm which Flora placed under her own pillow an effect
 universal? It seemed so; for not an inmate of that dwelling but
 upon this particular night enjoyed a Dream of Love! Alyce, the gentle
 Alyce, in sleep's resistless spell, was once again in youth, the loved, adored
 young bride of the handsome merchant of the Bridge.  She fancied herself, as we have described her to have been in the earliest chapter of our
 romance, standing at the casement, viewing the passing maypole; and
 once more felt the blushes suffuse her face, as when the morris dancers
 had singled her out as beauty's queen: again she saw the admiring crowds
 gazing upon the infant beauty of her child; but what seemed more than
 all to her, was the gentle pressure of a loving husband's arm, as it
 supported her, and the kind, but proud smile with which that husband
 gazed upon his soul's idol, herself, his own sweet Alyce; hers was
 indeed a Dream of Love.
  </p><p> Eoline's visions were but the continuation of her daily dream; for all

who live in blindness, must ever live in dreams, at least regarding
things material.  Imagination had built an idol in her heart unalterable:
age had no power to wither the roses she had pictured in his cheek;
care could not blanch it with his ashy hand. What first she pictured, still
to the last she saw; if seeing with the mind can be called sight.
 </p><p> At the same hour of night, the Cripple and herself had dreamt of
that night's same hour, which made them one; and theirs was a Dream of
Love.
 </p><p> Poor Flora never dreamt of anything but love; nor did her swain, her
own sweet William; therefore theirs, forsooth, must have been Dreams
of Love.
 </p><p> But what did lovely Anne dream of that night? First, she dreamt
of her mother, and her, we know, she loved ; next of her sire, and no
love was lacking there; her vision now seemed wandering far and wide,
o'er heath and dale, o'er copse and glade; but see, 'tis resting now upon
a poor old man, seated by a little child ; he kisses it, and seems to love
it for its helplessness : its face is like a mirror in which she sees her own-
the child has vanished-and now the old man's head she feels is resting
upon her breast; her arms are round his neck; she loves him for the
love he gave to her, when none were near to love her but himself. In
truth, youth turns to age, but in her dream, age turned to youth. She
saw a kind of lists, arrayed as if for a jousting; and many a gallant youth
was there, smiling, and full of hope.  Lords were there, and decked in
gaudy pride; the game to play was running at the ring.  Around and
round they pranced, but none could yet carry away the ring upon his
lance; one had an unlucky fall, and when his helmet was removed, she
saw the features of Lerue. On went the game, the worsted knight forgotten; but still none ever caught the ring; when presently a youth,
but humble in attire, seemed as if risen from the earth; for no announcement had there been of his approach; he came modestly to try his power of
eye, and steadiness of aim. Gently, at first he took the space around, but
suddenly, as if he had seen the prize he was to strive for, he put spurs to
his steed, and soon was passing all competitors. Observing, with a smile,
the awkward failures his opponents made, he thrust his hand into his
breast, and drawing forth his heart, placed it on his lance, and thus
oddly armed, at the next round, bore off the ring in triumph.  But what
seemed strangest to Anne, of all this strange dream, was that the prize
so many aimed at was nothing but her own fair hand, which now she
saw start up where late the ring had been. She trembled in her
sleep: who could the victor be? The helmet was removed-the winner
of her hand was-Edward Osborne. She heaved a deep-drawn sigh, and
then awoke; was that the sigh he really heard? And was not hers
a dream of love?</p>

 THERE are few people, be they never so wise, who have not one time or
 another suffered their better sense to be led captive for awhile, by the
 recollections of a dream, and many a day has been rendered one of
 sadness or of joy, by the waking mind still clinging to the vision of the
previous night. This was very powerfully exemplified in the case of the
lovely Anne. She smiled at her own folly, as she called it, for thinking
a second time of the nonsense of a dream; but strange to say, the more
she endeavoured to banish the recollection from her mind, the more tenaciously would her thoughts hold on to the forbidden theme. It was
very odd, but it was very true, that on the morrow, while all else were
recounting some portions of their sleeping reveries, Anne alone was silent;
perhaps she believed her own wild fancy of the midnight hour too absurd
to be related; be that as it might, she certainly did not once touch upon
the subject.
   </p><p>" Well," said Flora, "people may talk as they like about dreams, but
 I've known many and many a one come true; and I hope mine may;
 and then Master Hewet will be Lord Mayor of London town, and I shall
 see William, there, as gay as a robin red breast, with scarlet coat and
 glittering badge, lording it over the twenty rowers of the golden barge."
  </p><p> "And if ever I be Lord Mayor," replied Hewet, "William shall assuredly be my head bargeman, and shoot me -   don't start, my Alyce dear,
 but shoot me he shall, not through the brain, but through the Bridge,
 just to prove he has not forgotten his old trade."
 </p><p>  The merchant laughed heartily at his own miserable attempt at a joke,
 and all present for the moment seemed happy. No, there were two who
 although they compelled themselves to smile, did it so badly that it had
 better been left undone; these were Anne and Osborne.  Flora, who was
 in a rather teazing humour, observing Edward's melancholy look, said-
 " Why, Master Edward, you really seem still in a dream; if so, let us
 hope it is ' the dream of Love, that sweetest dream, that ever haunts the
 midnight hour !"
</p><p>   Before half a dozen words had been pronounced, poor Osborne's face
 was all on fire. Why, those were the very words he had been repeating
 to himself half the live-long night; and words, too, that he believed he had
 himself written. Had he done as many a would-be poet has done before,
 taken another's thoughts, while thinking them his own ?
 </p><p> Flora saw the confusion she had caused in Edward's mind, and cruelly
 pursued her sudden mischievous fancy-" Yes," she said, " what a
 beautiful old song that is; it's very old, but that makes it not less to be








<pb id="p.300" n="300"/>
  admired."  Every time she used the word old, a new blush came upon
  Edward's face. The Bridge-shooter, too, made horrible contortions by
  winking, and other little secret hints to Flora, to desist, but all to no
  purpose; on she would go-" I'll repeat the whole of it, although I have
  not heard it for many a year." Saying this, and not waiting for consent
  from  any one, she went through the entire of Edward's first poetical
  effusion.
</p><p>    As she came to the last line, he could bear it no longer, so starting up
 left the room; he hurried to his own; he seized his writing-case, and
 nearly broke the lock in his anxiety to open it. He became more and
 more perplexed, for there he found his treasure safe in its hiding-place-
 " Well," he said,  is it possible that my memory should be so good as
 to retain another's words, and yet so bad as to forget they were another's ?
 It cannot be; and yet she repeated every word, every syllable as I have
 set it down here on this paper now before me." Again locking the case,
 he once more descended to the lower room, determined to take the first
 opportunity of solving the mystery, by speaking openly upon the subject
 when he should find Flora alone.
 </p><p>  It had been settled on the previous night, that the merchant and the
 Bridge-shooter should return to London in the morning, leaving Edward
 at the cottage, to attend upon his former friend, the Cripple, who for
 certain reasons was to be kept out of sight, until matters should be more
 matured.
 </p><p>  Osborne was delighted with the arrangement, for as yet he had not
 been made acquainted with all the strange causes that had brought the
 Cripple once more to England, and had placed him beneath the roof of
 him the Cripple had formerly held in detestation.
 </p><p>  As the merchant intended to go by water, it was settled that Anne
should accompany her father as far as the Ferry, being anxious to hear
tidings of her young suffering friend, for as yet she knew not of Lillia's
death.
 </p><p>  As Osborne was to go with them, in order to escort her home again,
the Cripple, who was as anxious to tell Edward all that had befallen him
and his adored Eoline, as Edward was to hear the tale, determined to
stroll along with them.
 </p><p>  "Wonders will never cease, Master Edward," said the Cripple,
" never, never! You must have been strangely surprised to have found
the Cripple of the Bridge-gate-tower a guest of Master Hewet-were you
not"
 </p><p> " That I was surprised to see you at the Cottage of the Heath, I
cannot deny," replied young Osborne; "but that you should one day
become the merchant's guest, I never expected would surprise me; for I
knew his goodness and your good sense, and that time would remove
whatever prejudices you had unjustly-for I was sure it would prove
unjust-built up in your mind against him: but what first brought about
the change ?"
 </p><p> " An angel," replied the Cripple, " a child of earth, but with a mind
of heaven-Eoline."
 </p><p> " As you yourself have broached the subject," said Osborne; "tell me,
Willy, what was your first cause of hatred to the merchant ?"








                                <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>
   </p><p> "This misshapen trunk," replied the Cripple, looking down upon his
  own deformity; " this, and a father's and a mother's death.  I believed
  I owed all three to him; and all I panted for was the revenge of placing
  his head upon the Bridge-gate-tower.  Often used I to picture to myself,
  when goaded to madness by the insult and mockery of the crowd, how I
  would one day laugh, as I danced around the withering head of him who
  had caused my wrongs.  I was then a monster in mind as well as form,
  until the ray of Heaven shed its softening light upon my darkened soul,
  brought to it by the gentlest heart that ever beat within a mortal's
  breast. The moment I found a thing to love me, I was another being.
  What cared I for other's beauties! I was beloved-what else would I be ?
  From that moment one third of my hatred of Master Hewet found its
  grave. My deformities I had forgiven, for in spite of them I was
  beloved."
  </p><p>  " But what mean you, Willy," enquired Osborne, " by laying to the
  merchant's charge your difference in form to other men ?"
   </p><p> " It were a sad tale, and a long, did I tell you all; but, to the end
  at once, and then you'll quickly feel why I should have held the merchant in such hate.  The fiends who blasphemously called themselves
  the preachers of Christ's mercies, condemned my father to the flames,
  because his conscience saw not with eyes like theirs: he had read-had
  felt that God asked for thoughts, not words; that God demanded the
  prostration of our inward souls, not the mere bending of our outward
  bodies; that he was to be propitiated by penitence before himself, not by
  the intercession of some painted doll. For thoughts like these, he was
  condemned-for words like these he suffered.  I see in your looks the
question you would ask-I'll answer it unasked.  I was ever taught by
  the poor demented being I called my mother, that merchant Hewet was
  the sole cause of our undoing.  I know the error now, but of that anon;
  you cannot guess why I should lay at the merchant's door the cause of
  my deformity ? I'll tell you, why I did so. It was by those nearest to
  me believed, that from information given by William  Hewet, then a
  mere boy, that my father was condemned for Heresy.  Ha, ha ! ho, ho !
  he he !" and the old malignant chuckling laugh, for once was again
heard; for once again his thoughts were carried back to the time, when
  his only solace lay in the contempt with which he tried to laugh at all
his more favoured fellow creatures. "Heresy, heresy !" and he repeated
the word still more bitterly; " know you the meaning of the word,
  young Master Edward ? if not, I'll tell you. HERESY is in the not
  thinking as those think who are in power; gain but the power to
  punish, and then all are heretics who think not like yourself.  Oh!
  powpowepower! how wondrous religious does it make us in our own
  conceit! Now mark the difference a few years have made; my father
  was deemed to be a child of Satan, and to Satan's fiery home was sent,
  as they believed, through fire; had he still lived he had now been
almost worshiped as a saint, for he was truly good. All the arts that
artful priests could bring to bear upon his health, his mind, his human
feelings, were employed to bend him to their will; but all in vain: long
  was he kept in prison-starved-then tempted by all the promised luxuries
  that could tempt a starving man; but still his firmness failed him not.







<pb id="p.302" n="302"/>                  .

The last hope to subdue him was my mother; they had not long been
married; she loved my father as her life; his life was naught to him,
compared to the love he felt for her; but his conviction in regard to the
great TRUTH, was mightier than all his worldly hopes. Now came the
last, the fatal scene. It was enacted in that place of fire, of torture, and
of blood, Smithfield. There stood the pulpit, from which naught but
charity and peace to all mankind should ever flow, but now erected to
sanction the tortures of earthly flames, and to send to flames eternal,
were it in the power of man to do so, the upright soul of one, who
merely differed in outward form of worship of that God, whom he and
his accusers both knelt before, and called all-merciful.  When all else
had failed to shake my poor father, in this dreadful moment of earthly
trial, what did the miscalled holy fiends do then ? they brought his
wife, my mother soon to be, the idol of his heart, the bliss or anguish of
his every thought -they brought her to him while fastened to the stake-
they forced her on her knees to pray of him to save his life, by renouncing,
what they called his damning heresy; and when this last, this horrid
attempt to subdue affrighted nature, failed, they placed a burning brand
within her grasp, and then by force compelled the wife to fire the fatal
pile, that was to consume in tortures her heart's adored-her husband.
I have been told that at the first trial, the very faggots seemed, as by
miracle, to refuse to burn; but the monster who had the welcome work
in charge, soon subdued their obstinacy, by guiding her hand to those
substances the most inflammable; the smoke ascended; the flames at last
burst forth ; and amidst the cries of agony of a dying father, and the
shrieks of a mother maddened by her anguish, I was untimely born !"
  </p><p>As the poor Cripple had advanced more and more in his dreadful
narrative, slower had become his pace; Edward and he were now alone, -
and as he uttered the last words, he buried his head upon Osborne's
shoulder and wept aloud.
 </p><p> After he had somewhat recovered, he looked down upon his misshapen
limbs, then turning to Edward, said-" Could I look upon these deformities, without remembering the dreadful cause that brought such a
monster upon earth. I had always been led to believe that the merchant
had been the denouncer of my father, and by that denunciation the
digger of a mother's early grave.  Every insult that an unfeeling world
heaped upon me, engendered in my heart another drop of bitter gall, to
poison my mind against Master Hewet. But I was wrong, as all are
who foster hate.  The merchant had never wronged me or mine ; this
was by chance made clear to me by the Abbess of St. Clair."
 </p><p> At the mention of the Abbess, Edward stopped the Cripple in his
narration, to ask concerning her fate; for strange to say, so full had his
mind been upon other subjects, more near to his own heart, and so little
had been the opportunities, as yet, of entering fully into the strange
cause of the Cripple's sudden and unexpected appearance in England,-
that hitherto her name had not been mentioned; but now it led to all
that Osborne had still to learn.
</p><p> It appeared that when Spikely had been found amongst the dead, and
had been, as the reader is aware, taken to the dwelling of the Cripple,
he had, when he believed himself upon the point of death, made a confession







                                                  <pb id="p.303" n="303"/>

  to the Abbess, of things of great importance to Eoline: amongst
  others he divulged, but this he did more out of hate towards Horton,
  than from a wish to serve the wronged, that Horton had stolen the documents that alone could prove the rights of Eoline, whatever they
  might be.
 </p><p> "And, think of our surprise," said the Cripple, "to discover,
concealed in the very mattress upon which we had conveyed Eoline to the
ship, years ago, the treasure which the Abbess alone knew the value of,
and which she had believed was for ever lost.  Who the wounded soldier
was, he never would disclose, or how he came to the knowledge which
  was of such worth to us.  The instant he had recovered sufficiently to
  leave his couch, he departed from our house, and since that time we
  never heard more concerning him."
  </p><p>  " Then it is to prosecute Eoline's claim," enquired Edward, " that
 has brought you here ? but who and what is she then ? She was always
 regarded as a poor orphan, kept at the convent out of charity."
 </p><p>   Before the Cripple could reply, they heard a great shouting, from a
  crowd assembled in the little market-place, for they had now entered the
  town.
 </p><p>   "What is the matter?" enquired the merchant, of one of the bystanders.
 </p><p>   " Oh, no great matter," replied the man ; "only Master Blaze, the
  smith, going to sell a beggar; that is, if such a fool can be found as to buy
  such a lump of useless lumber; why, he's too old for anything but to
  eat."  This the man said very loud, as if to depreciate the value of the
  article.  " Why there is such a crowd, do ye see, is because this is the
  first beggar that has been sold since the passing of the act; there won't
  be many beggars soon, but there'll be lots of slaves."  Then, in a whisper,
  he said, " I mean to buy him if I can."
 </p><p> "Then you want to prove there is one fool great enough to buy such
a lump of useless lumber ?" said the Bridge-shooter.
 </p><p>  Ah ! but I want him for a fancy of my own," replied the fellow.
</p><p>  " You see, my master, I'm a man of impulse-and so is my wife-that
  is, I mean, she's a woman of impulse; and when I'm cross, and when
  she's cross, we both feel that we must bang somebody.  Now, if I bang
  her, she bangs me in return, and that's a game at which I'm sure to
  lose-or rather win-if getting more than I give, is to be called winning;
so you see, my master, as the law allows us to beat our slaves if they
won't work, and as I'm sure he can't work, it struck me that he'd be
just the thing, as a sort of off-let to our ill humours, and will enable us
to live as lovingly together as-as-but here he comes, and now for
the fun."
 </p><p>  As the fellow said this, he started off nearer to the spot where a sort of
 large table had been placed, and upon which the smith, the worthy
 Master Blaze, immediately mounted, attended by the same official whom
 Osborne had seen before in the smithy.
  </p><p> This official, or tip-staff, read in a loud voice, the new act-" Statute
 I, Edward VI., c. 3, laying great emphasis upon the words, which empowered the master to sell, bequeath, let out for hire, or give the service
 of their slaves to any person whomsoever, upon such conditions, and for







<pb id="p.304" n="304"/>                    .

such term of years, as the said persons be adjudged to them for slaves,
after the like sort and manner as they may do of any other of their
moveable goods or chattels."
 </p><p> The legal document having been read, Master Blaze began a long
speech about the wonderful qualities of the human being he had to sell,
"industry, willingness, and never-to-be-subdued strength," were but the
faintest of the brilliant virtues possessed by the worthy creature he had
to offer to their notice.  On run his tongue, till the bystanders began to
shew symptoms of weariness, and, in fact, called loudly to see the lot.
When the bondsman did appear, a roar of laughter ensued, for instead of
looking upon a perfect Hercules in strength-an Adonis in beauty, the
crowd beheld the same poor old man whom Osborne had saved from ill-
usage, by a large bribe to the smith.
 </p><p> Anne, who until that moment had not looked towards the disgusting
scene, now raised her eyes, and suddenly clinging to her father's arm,
exclaimed-" Gracious Heavens! 'tis the poor old man !-father, father,
'tis he !"
 </p><p> " Whom mean you, child ?" enquired the merchant, not comprehends
ing why she could be thus suddenly moved.
  </p><p>"'Tis he, I say ! 'tis, 'tis he !" she repeated, still more agitated than
before.
 </p><p> "I know him not," said the merchant.
</p><p>  "But I do," replied Anne, and then, as if half choking to find words to
explain her meaning, she exclaimed-" 'tis the-the-old devil !" for
that one instant her whole mind had flown back to her childhood's miseries.
She saw before her the only being who had made those miseries endurable;
she would have sprang forward to have embraced her never-to-be-forgotten
saviour, had not the merchant held her back.
 </p><p>"Hush," whispered her father; be calm; all will be well yet."
  What a strange mixture of bewildring thought now flew through
Anne's excited mind, as she gazed upon the poor old man, mounting
upon the platform; the last few years had seemed to add an age to his
former venerable mien.  His locks were thinner, and whiter too; his
steps were far more tottering than they were, when last she had seen
him turning away, as she lay concealed in the Tyboum Tree, and had
then heard his feeble voice calling upon Heaven to bless her. Not an incident of that miserable eventful portion of her life, but now stood before
her mind in all the vivid colouring of a frightful dream.
 </p><p> The merchant himself could not resist a powerful emotion, that seemed
to fly from his very heart into his throat. He, too, was in his mind looking
upon a scene of years gone by; that scene of bliss, wherein he beheld
his long-lost child, as by a miracle, restored to his longing arms.  The
very words he had then uttered, upon hearing that to this poor old man
he had owed the restoration of his child, now flew to his tongue, and he
once again exclaimed, " God's blessing light on him! he shall be happy
if wealth can make him so !"
 </p><p> He whispered something into the ear of the Cripple, who, mixing with
the crowd, approached very near to the platform, or rather heavy table
For some time no bidding was offered, until the man to whom the mer








<pb id="p.305" n="305"/>

 chant and the Bridge-shooter had talked, appeared to think the proper
 moment had arrived to secure a bargain, offered a hundred pence.
   </p><p>The Cripple, to Anne's delight, now offered double. The crowd,
 seeing the strange figure of the last bidder, began to jeer and laugh; and
 one, more impudent than the rest, repeated his words, and then his
 limping gait; upon which the Cripple placed his iron grasp behind the
 fellow's neck, and then, with resistless force, sent him sprawling at full
 length amongst the crowd at the other side of the open space about the
 platform. The laugh now was turned upon the discomfited jester, and
 then the sale proceeded.
  </p><p> There were but two bidders-the man with the dreaded wife, and the
 Cripple. The smith, seeing the determination of the Cripple to have the
 slave, gave a knowing wink to the first bidder, whom he knew  right
 well; and this being taken as it was intended, up ran the biddings,
 until the man, beginning to be fearful that he might have misunderstood
 the smith's wink, and thus be saddled with a bargain the wrong way,
 at last refused to bid on, and the Cripple thus became the purchaser.
  </p><p> "For what have you bought me ?" said the old man, as the Cripple
 took hold of the iron chain, which was attached to the ring around his
neck;  for what have you bought me at this fearful price ? I'm old
and weak-I can't work-I only wish to die."
 </p><p>  " I've bought you for a lady's toy," replied the Cripple, smiling,
 "and for one who could, an' she would, make a thousand better men
 then you or I her slaves; and that you'll own, when you shall see your
 mistress."
 </p><p>  The Bridge-shooter now advanced, bringing the merchant's purse.
 </p><p>  The money being paid-the receipt lawfully drawn out-and then a
handful of small coin being thrown amongst the crowd, a scramble
ensued, in the midst of which the Cripple, unnoticed, bore away his
purchase.
 </p><p>  The old man eyed with astonishment the Cripple as he led him away
by the chain, as men were then accustomed to lead about the dancing
bears; but his astonishment was a thousand times augmented, when
turning into a secluded spot, a lovely girl sprang forward, and throwing
her arms around his neck, kissed him with all the affection of a child.
He held her from him, as if bewildered; he gazed upon her lovely face;
he looked around as asking a solution of this dream-like scene; but he
soon felt that no dream was there, when Anne exclaimed-" Grandfather, grandfather, have you indeed forgotten little Anne, the child you
loved-the child you saved at Tybourne Tree ? Look at me! I am older
now: altered I must be, since you know me not-altered in all, but
in the feelings of gratitude towards you, the poor child's only friend !"
 </p><p> " Great Heaven !" he exclaimed, " and have my prayers been heard;
and do my old eyes once again gaze upon the poor wronged thing, that I
so loved-so often prayed to see once more ?"
</p><p>  'Tis I, indeed, grandfather," replied Anne; " and here stands my
real father, him of whom  I used to tell such tales about,  when I thought
he was no father to poor Anne; and here is Edward, too: you remember
Edward. Oh, yes, you must remember him; for don't you recollect, I
used to tell you how kind he had always been to me ; and had saved my







<pb id="p.306" n="306"/>

life; and-but you must remember him; and here is the Bridge-shooter,
who taught Edward to swim, and thus to rescue me; and this is the -
I mean Willy of the Bridge-gate-tower, that we used to talk about so
much.
</p><p>   The old man looked from one to the other, as Anne pronounced their
names, but seemed completely lost; then fixing his eyes intently upon
her face, began to examine every feature-" Yes, yes," he at last exclaimed, " it is, it is the poor wronged child, the little Anne that I so
loved !"
 </p><p>  It was soon explained to him why he had been purchased; and the
ring was speedily removed from around his neck.
 </p><p>  The merchant now told him that for years he had been endeavouring
to discover the protector, the saviour of his darling child; and that
having, as by a miracle, at last found him, he should no more want a
protector, or a home.
 </p><p>  He was now placed under the care of the Cripple, to convey him up
to the Cottage on the Heath.  The merchant's affairs compelling him to
hasten to London, he, with the Bridge-shooter, hurried to the Ferry, as
Anne, after taking a kind farewell of her newly-found old friend, placed
her arm within that of Edward, and then, with a light step and a lighter
heart, proceeded towards the little Inn.
  </p><p> The joy she felt, at the discovery she had just made, was, alas ! of
short duration, for the closed Ferry-house told her too plainly the tale
of death. The people about the place informed her, that from the moment Lillia had died, her father had not spoken a single word; that the
village doctor had ordered no one to disturb him in his sorrow; and had
further stated that so powerfully had the shock acted upon his mind and
frame, that unless nature received some speedy relief, from a source
beyond the power of earthly skill, the same grave would, in all probability, close upon both the father and the child.
 </p><p> Anne wept bitterly at hearing this sad account of her she had loved with
a sister's love, the poor Lilly of the inn.-" Oh, Edward!" she exclaimed,
as they began slowly to retrace their steps towards their home, "this
world seems made up of disappointment and of sorrow;     the few
happy moments permitted to poor mortals, are even at their birth robbed
of half their brightness, from the too well-grounded fear, that ere they
can be fairly siezed on, the dark cloud that is ever rolling in their wake,
will overtake, and with its shadow dim all their promised lustre.  How
happy the discovery of my old grandfather, as I used to call him in my
days of suffering, had now made me, but for this sad, sad event !"
 </p><p> Edward would willingly have given the sweet girl by his side some
little consolation, if he could, but so full of melancholy was his own
mind, that all he said rendered her still more wretched.
 </p><p> "Let us not hurry home, Edward," said Anne, as they came to a road
that turned to the upper part of the heath; "for I would not carry my
sadness there; and after a time I shall be more myself: let us stroll
through this lovely lane, and do you tell me something, anything, to
change my present unhappy thoughts."
 </p><p> " I am but in a poor mood," replied Osborne, " to talk cheerfully, for
my whole thoughts are bent upon a subject, that when you shall learn







<pb id="p.307" n="307"/>

the end to which it leads, I think you will own that I have cause for
being unhappy."
  </p><p>"What cause can you have, Edward, that your sister knows
not of?"
 </p><p> As she pronounced the word sister, Osborne involuntarily bit his lip,
and then pointedly replied-" If a sister had ever been kind, ever devoted to a brother, should not that brother feel a bitter pang, if he found
that fate had made it necessary that they should part for ever ?"
</p><p>  "What mean you, dear Edward ?" exclaimed Anne, his words filling
her with surprise ; " surely, such a speech as that cannot apply to us !"
 </p><p> "Alas, too truly, does it !" continued young Osborne, turning aside,
not daring to trust himself to gaze upon her, while he revealed his intention. "Anne," he said, "I have been long wishing to ask your
advice-nay, not that-for when the mind is determined, it were useless
to seek advice; but I have wished to tell you the plans I have formed
for my future life. Do not be surprised at, nor for the present divulge
to mortal, what I shall now tell you.  You know the great interest
your good father possesses abroad amongst the merchants there.  I have
discovered that ere long the manager of the English Factory at Antwerp,
will leave that station, and 'tis my intention to solicit it, through your
father's means.  It will be a bitter parting when I leave all I ever
loved, to seek my fortune in a foreign land; but, since my mind has
taken a turn, unknown to all but myself, I feel it would prove, oh, far
more bitter still, were I to remain! Do not ask me the cause of this
determination, for I will never breathe the secret to mortal ear: do not
attempt to persuade me to alter my fixed resolve; it would but add
another pang, without even shaking my now firmly-rooted intention.
When I do leave England-it will be for ever."
 </p><p> So unlooked for was the revelation she had heard, that for a mement,
the astonished girl could not utter a word; and when she did she scarcely
knew what she said.
</p><p>  "Oh, Edward, Edward !" at last she exclaimed; "were not your
words too cruel for a jest, I would not, could not think you serious.
Leave us ! your home ! your country ! and for ever !-impossible ! What
says my father to this wild, this unfeeling scheme ?"
 </p><p> "As yet, he knows not of my wishes," replied Edward, "and the
only reason I have for doubting the wisdom of my plan, is the disinclination, the almost dread I have of disclosing it to him.  He will ask my
reasons, and he is the last on earth that I would reveal them to."
</p><p>  "  eveal them, then, to me !" ejaculated Anne, as she gazed imploringly into his eyes, as though she would through them read the secret
of his inmost soul; "confide all your cares, all your sorrows to me;
for I fear you have cares, and sorrows too, Edward, that we little
dream of."
</p><p>"Whatever they may be, Anne," he replied, "and I own I have
troubles; but they are such, that none but he that suffers beneath their
weight, can ever comprehend the pangs that they inflict"
 </p><p> "Then they are troubles of the mind," she replied, "the weightiest
of all to bear; we have had a sad proof of this, but now."
 </p><p> "What mean you?" enquired Osborne.







<pb id="p.308" n="308"/>
 </p><p> "You know, dear Edward, that unlike you, I never keep a secret, at
least from you, my brother." Osborne groaned. "The poor child Lillia,
has died I fear-nay, I am certain, from having allowed her mind to eat
away her life. Young and innocent as she was, she had deceived herself,
and loved."
 </p><p> "And was rejected !" exclaimed Edward.
 </p><p> No," continued Anne; " but believing that she had betrayed her
own affection, to one by whom her love was not returned, she drooped
and died."
</p><p>  "Then she was too proud," said Edward, " to ask the truth, and
sought the grave, rather than hazard a rejection. She was right; were
I to love, I would suffer a thousand deaths, before I would- "
</p><p>  "Would what ?" said a very pretty voice close to his ear.
</p><p>  Both he and Anne started at the sound, and were then greeted by a
laugh from Flora, who was looking at them, from one of the windows of
the ruins of the chapel, near which they were now passing.
 </p><p> " I hope I've not disturbed you," said she, "for really so absorbed did
you both appear with each other's conversation, that, had I not known
that freezing Master Edward, and chilly Mistress Anne, had been
chiselled out of stone, I should really have believed I had been gazing
upon two living lovers-stone did I say ! I ought to have said ice, for
ice is colder than stone; and yet that would have been a bad comparison,
for ice will melt in time, and run away; therefore, ice and lovers are not
so unlike as one would at first believe- are they ?"
 </p><p> Both Anne and her companion attempted to smile, but failed; so Flora
thinking it a bad time to jest further, told them that Dame Alyce and
the lovely Eoline were in the ruins. Osborne felt rather relieved at the
interruption which had broken off a conversation that he began to fear
would lead him to betray his secret to her, of all others he would have
concealed it from. "No !" thought he, "where there is no hope there
should be silence; if he had been so mad as to allow himself to look upon
Anne with other than a brother's eyes, he deserved to pay the penalty
his own folly had brought upon him; it was evident to him that Anne's
feelings were very different to what his own had lately become, but independent of her lack of that warmest of all affections, love, there appeared
to him a barrier quite as insurmountable as her coldness-that was his
belief in the merchant's proud notions with regard to the future settlement of his daughter; so that the more he reflected upon the subject, the
more necessary did it appear to him that he should not delay one unnecessary moment in flying from the enchantment in which he had
suddenly found himself; an enchantment-that with hope, would have
made this world to him an earthly paradise, but without that sweetest
food of love, it was a spell of endless torture."
 </p><p> When they had joined Alyce and Eoline, they had much to say, first
about the death of poor Lillia, the news of which shocked Alyce greatly;
then concerning the strange discovery of the old man, to whom Anne
had really owed her restoration to her home and adoring parents. Alyce
hearing that by that time he would be at the cottage, hastened away
with Eoline and Edward, leaving Anne and Flora to follow them. As
they strolled home, Flora made several attempts to be sprightly, hoping






<pb id="p.309" n="309"/>

by these means to cheer up her young mistress; but all her efforts proved
unavailing, so that long before they reached the cottage, the two had
become perfectly silent.  Was Anne ruminating upon the uncertainty of
human life, exemplified in the unlooked-for death of her sweet young
friend Lillia; or were her thoughts suddenly turned into a rapid channel,
which until that day she knew not had existence, and even now dreamt
not from whence it flowed, or to what smooth or troubled sea it might
carry her away ?</p></div1>

</p><p>IT was a dark and dreary night, and the hand of time was already pointing to the midnight hour, when in a miserable room, in one of the most
miserable dwellings in the most miserable part of London, two persons
might be seen sitting in deep converse by a single flickering lamp, whose
vitality seemed to possess but a feeble hold upon the impure liquid that
was intended to feed and cherish it. One of the speakers was a man
well dressed, and of soldier-like bearing;-over the high back of the
chair upon which he sat, hung his military cloak; he was well armed,
and before him on the table lay a large pistol. His companion was very
meanly dressed; haggard, and worn by toil and depravity, were her
features, which had evidently been handsome in the days of their youth.
Her eye was still bright, and from it flashed the light of firmness and
determination.-The man was Horton-his companion, the wretch Nan,
of the monster show.
</p><p>" If what you say be sooth," exclaimed Nan, "then my many
troubles begin to end: while he lived, poor indeed was my chance of
peace; he was one who never remembered a friend-nor ever forgot a
foe. And you are sure he is dead ?" she again enquired.
 </p><p> "Sure," replied Horton--" I saw him with my own eyes expire on
the field of battle."
</p><p>  Horton did not think it necessary to acquaint Spikely's wife with the
care he himself had taken to assist his former friend out of this world.
</p><p>  " That he should die in blood," said Nan, " is but what I had always
expected; but a soldier's death should not have been for him: the hangman's knife, not the warrior's sword, should have shed his blood, when
half dead from hanging. I had always promised him to be within sight
on that day; but if he's dead, why, there's an end. But are you sure?"
she again repeated, as still doubting that such joyful news could really
be true.
</p><p>  " Not only did I see him fall," said Horton, "but saw the body cast
upon the heap of dead ready for burial: he must be strong indeed if he
can lift up the load of death and earth beneath which he lies, to come







<pb id="p.310" n="310"/>                   .

and scare you more. How often it has struck me, Nanny (you see I
still remember the old name I used to call you by when a mere babe).
yes, Nanny, it has often struck me that certain spirits, or people, or
whatever you like to call them, are destined from birth to work together,
whether for good or evil; when I say together, I mean not hand in hand,
but all their acts, words, deeds, or thoughts, though perhaps the actors be
a thousand miles apart, are still by some mysterious link united-a single
word at times, uttered at the Antipodes, will prove that link, and bring
together, not the people, but their thoughts and deeds, and from that word
new deeds and thoughts will take their spring, still keeping, as it were,
the whole in concert though apart: who could have thought, when my
father ill used the little girl, the pretty Nancy, and turned her adrift
upon a heartless world, that that very act would one day bring about
his own son's fortune, and by that means be a reward to her for all her
wrongs; so be assured, Nanny," and he looked as kindly at her as his
nature would allow, " that whatever fortune you bring to me, shall by
you with me be shared."
  </p><p>" I'll take care of that," was the unexpected reply, " I've known the
world too long to trust to fair words and soft looks; if you get it, I get
it, or it is gotten by neither of us "
  </p><p> "All fair and straight as it should be," said Horton, " when a bargain
is struck between a man and his dear old nurse: eh, Nanny? So now tell
me all."
   </p><p>"When you have given me the bond I will; in law, I fancy, words
that can be seen, bind faster than those that can be heard-sounds die
away, and are easily forgotten-but ink stains deep, and can always revive short memories. I'll not be hard, and as the amount in all cannot
be now discovered, I'll take one quarter of the whole, be it what it may."
 </p><p>  Horton looked rather blank for a moment, for he found, what he had
before suspected, that in his old nurse he had at least an equal, if not
more, than his match. Feeling that to be shilly-shally now, would cost
him more than he could gain by it, he appeared to enter at once honestly
into her proposal. "Where is the ink, Nanny," he said, " that stains
so deeply? not that my memory would require a reviver with regard to
any promises made to you."
  </p><p> " It's close at hand," she replied, at the same time rising, and opening
the shattered door of a cupboard; from a shelf inside she brought forth an
old broken wine glass, the stem of which was forced into a bung by way
of stand: in this was some ink. A new pen, and a sheet of white
paper, she placed by its side before Horton.
 </p><p> I can write while you talk, Nanny," said Horton, holding up the
pen to the flickering lamp, as if to see that the nibs were equal, but in
reality to gain time, and thus obtain as much information as possible,
hoping that he might yet learn all without binding himself to a sort of
partnership.
 </p><p>  Nan never deigned to utter a word, or move a muscle. Horton
glanced at her immovable features and stone-like form more than once;
then, as if conscious of his own inability to move a rock, began to
write. On ran his hand, but Nan moved not. At last he exclaimed-
"'Tis done !"  Without saying a word, she quietly took the paper from








                                          <pb id="p.311" n="311"/>

the table, and carefully perusing it, placed it again upon the table.
"Right, quite right," she said, " a limb of Satan could not have worded
it more binding !"
  </p><p> " Well, then," replied Horton, " if you are satisfied, all is concluded.
 So now, dear Nanny, relate all I would have you tell."
  </p><p> " A deed, is a deed," said Nan, " whether it has two names or four attached to it; but lawyers won't believe this simple fact; so we must
 have witnesses to make it binding."
  </p><p> Nan stamped her foot thrice upon the floor, when, to Horton's astonishment, in walked two of the most ill-looking fellows he had ever seen
 -and Horton had seen a few.  The one was our former friend, Ugly
 Tom-the other, our almost-as-well-known intimate, the " walking
 gentleman" of the show, Master Walking-stick, the tall noseless son of
 the deceased giant--the long-since-bereaved husband of Sarah, the bandy-legged tight-rope dancer.
 </p><p>  As actors, be their sphere of action ever so humble, always possess,
 whether from nature or from art, a rather superior carriage when they
 choose, the present performers entered, and, though ruffians in look, saluted Horton courteously.  This made him lift his hand from the pistol, upon which he had placed it, and raising his cap, salute them.
 They appeared perfectly to understand why they had been called; for
 upon Nan pointing to the paper, and Horton passing his pen again over
 his signature, they both stepped forward, and having made their marks
 X,+, without a word, retired.
</p><p> As Nan doubled up the paper and placed it in a cupboard (not the
one from which she had taken the ink, but one that was well barred and
nailed with iron), she said, " I called the boys,"-now the boys were,
the one about six feet, the other nearer eight feet in height-" not so
much to witness your signature-for that, would you cheat me, would be
of little value-but to shew you that I am here 'midst friends; and
such, that did you attempt to play me false, would let your throat know
that a tongueless mouth might be made below your chin. Think of
this, and keep your bond."
 </p><p>  "Where we have honest thoughts," said Horton, attempting to assume
 an easy air, " we fear little from the punishment of those who only
 punish our misdeeds: so, fear me not."
 </p><p>  "I never feared but one man in my life," replied Nan, "and he
 would make a devil fear-but you say he is dead, so let that pass.
 And now what would you learn ?"
  </p><p> " What you alone can tell," replied Horton. " Who, and what am I ?
 -for I am  not what I seem to be. Who, and what is Eoline ?-for
 she is not what she seems."
 </p><p>  " In both surmises you are right. The world believes her a penniless,
 sightless orphan-you believe her to be your sister  The world and
 you are wrong."
 </p><p>  "Not my sister !" exclaimed Horton.
 </p><p>  " No !" replied Nan. " No blood of hers and yours ever flowed in
 the same channel.  Don't dash out my brains," she continued, half
 laughing, yet still evincing fear, " when I humble the pride of Master







<pb id="p.312" n="312"/>                  .

Horton, the would-be heir of Horton of Henley-when I tell him his
rightful father was a thief - my sister was his mother."
  </p><p>As she said this, involuntarily she drew herself back further from
Horton, who, starting to his feet, cast on her a look that would have
blasted if it could, as he exclaimed, "Thou liest, hell cat! I came not
here for fooleries like these, but to seek truth, and through the truth find
fortune."
  </p><p>"And if you be wise," she coolly replied, "in me you have found
them both. Sit quietly and listen; fools only rave, and wisdom  itself
turns foolish when out of temper: so sit, and coolly listen."
 </p><p> Horton again seated himself; but by the workings of his features,
and the bitings of his lips, it was not difficult to read, that in his mind
she had opened a page not easy to be digested, if even understood.
 </p><p>" To make all clear to you, I must relate matters of an early date,
even before your birth.  The man you always thought to be your father, Andrew Horton, who, from dissipation, died an old young man,'
had from early youth lived one unaltered course of deep, though secret
depravity. Woman was his prey. My sister was one of his many
victims. Of my own wrongs I will not speak.  Tempted by a sum of
money, one of the Birds of the Clink married my sister-you are their
child.'
</p><p>  Horton again bit his lips and frowned, but held his peace.
 </p><p> " Some time before this, (the real cause why he gave the bribe,
was to rid himself of my sister,) he wedded with a girl lowly of birth,
but beautiful in face. I too was reckoned handsome then, and for my
beauty, I suppose, had been retained: at all events I was still beneath
his roof, when his wife bore to him a son; at the same moment you
were born; and then it was that the idea entered my mind, what a glo
rious revenge it would be, to change the children, and make the thief's
son Horton's heir, and bring up Horton's son midst thieves! The
thought was scarcely formed before it was fulfilled.  Horton's real son
grew up a lovely boy, effeminate but beautiful An old man, who must
have been of great wealth, took a liking to him, and, for an enormous
sum, bought him of your mother, promising to make him his heir. Who
the old man was, and what became of the boy, I have never been able
to learn. All I know is, they went abroad, and now perchance are
both dead. You grew up a wayward boy; the blood of your real father
was in your veins, and made you what you are. She whom you called
your mother had another child, a girl, born in sorrow, for Horton was a
brute, and drove his wife almost to madness. I have known her weep
until she lost all power of sight-whether this could have influenced the
fate of her child that was still unborn, I know not; but when it came
into the world it was blind- totally blind: that child was Eoline."
 </p><p> " But how came she in the convent of the Minories ?" said Horton;
' and how knew the Abbess that she was my father's child ? or the
man I called my father, if it be really as you say."
 </p><p> " That I cannot answer," said Nan; "that knowledge is not mine to
give; but that Eoline and the child of Horton were one, I did; for my
sister, taking a religious fit, became one of the poor Clares; and when
she died, as she did soon after she had entered, I saw the blind girl






                                           <pb id="p.313" n="313"/>

there, and knew her: she had been lost before I was driven from his
roof, and I gloried in knowing it, for, strange to say, the only thing he ever
seemed to really love was that blind child: his wife had long before fled
from him, and, it is believed, destroyed herself.  We must meet again,
for I am worn out to-night, and there is much yet to tell, ere our plan
can be brought to bear: give me some money, and then leave me."
 </p><p> Horton, who would have learnt all at once if he could, but knowing
the being he had to deal with, felt it would be useless to press her
further, placed a purse upon the table, appointed another meeting,
and then taking up the pistol, left the wretched apartment. Nan held
the nearly-exhausted lamp over the stairs to enable Horton to find his
way down to the outer door.  The two men he had seen above were
there, who, without speaking, led him to the end of the alley, where they
left him to pursue his way along the more open street.
 </p><p> " If what she say be true," he muttered to himself, " I am not the
heir to Horton: no one but ourselves knows that secret; how then would
my claim stand were she dead ? Should I gain more by her evidence upon
other points, or safety by her death ? for if she please she can at once
upset all my claim to the wealth of the old wretch I used to call my father:
and yet I cannot do without her; she alone can prove the death of Eoline,
and of the Abbess too; but I'll not work my brain upon this point until
I have heard all she can divulge.  ' The son of a thief!' I could have
brained her when she said it.  If I but accomplish my end, her reward
shall be ample, but not such as she would have: no, no; her knowledge
is too valuable to be left at her own disposal; but with her I can easily
settle when the fit time shall come."  Filled with thoughts like these he
pursued his way to his own abode.
</p><p>  The reader may easily imagine how completely Anne's mind was torn
by conflicting emotions; the strange reappearance of the Cripple with
Eoline had added no little to her causes of serious thought: the fate of
her sweet young friend, Lillia, gave a blow to her heart almost insupportable, for she felt that, however innocently on her part, still she was
to a degree a participator in the cause of her untimely death. Then came
the old man, the only friend of her childhood's wretched days, to tear up
from the hidden stores of her memory, all the recollections of those incidents of her early life, that she would have wished to have been blotted
out of her remembrance for ever; but even all these varied feelings
seemed as nought compared to the painful sensation that Osborne's determination to quit England had given rise to.
 </p><p> So completely occupied had every one at the cottage been, from one
cause or another, that Anne and Osborne had not for several days been
again alone. Anne became every hour more and more abstracted; her
greatest pleasure was to be alone, or with her poor old friend, who had
been at once settled in a cottage of the farm, where, for hours and hours,
would the two talk over their past miseries, and of their future hopes.
When they spoke of the future, Anne invariably became sad, and would,
as quickly as possible, fly back to her days of suffering, as being to her
less painful than the anticipation of those that might yet come. One
night, as Flora was attending upon her, previous to her retiring to rest,
she became so buried in her own thoughts that Flora could bear it no

longer; so let loose to her powers of speech, and they were pretty strong
ones, she started off at full speed, touching upon every subject she could
think of as likely to interest and rouse her young mistress.
 </p><p> "Only think of that," said she, after having galloped along for some
time upon the same theme, "only think of that! oh! it's true, for
William heard it in the city, from a quarter that must know the truth;
and then you know your mother will be a real lady. How fine it will sound,
won't it ? to hear merchant Hewet called  my Lord,' and dame Alyce,
'my Lady;' what a pity a Lord Mayor is not a Lord Mayor always-
it takes away half one's delight to think that at the end of a year, my
Lord isn't my Lord; but the King always, William says, knights the
Lord Mayors; so you know ' Sir William Hewet' won't sound so very
bad-will it ?"
 </p><p> "What are you talking about?" said Anne, having just caught the
last few words.
 </p><p> " What about ?" replied Flora; "why haven't you heard all I've been
telling you, that very soon, so William says, your father, my honoured
master, will be a grand Lord Mayor; and won't he look handsome when
he rides along in my Lord Mayor's show ? But, oh dear ! oh lor' !"
</p><p>  "Are you ill ?" exclaimed Anne, anxiously.
</p><p>  "Oh my !" continued Flora, "oh dear! if Master Hewet is a Lord
Mayor, I shall become a prisoner for the rest of my life."
</p><p>  " What nonsense are you talking of Flora ?" said Anne. "What
mean you by a prisoner ?"
</p><p>  " Why, you must know that I have promised, that when master becomes Lord Mayor, William shall become my lord and master: William
is so dreadfully impatient."
 </p><p> Flora continued to chatter about her master's probable grandeur that
was to come; but Anne paid little attention to her; so the poor girl
having failed in her endeavour to cheer her young mistress, by degrees herself became sadder and sadder, when at last, heaving a sigh, she said, " I
hope to Heaven what William says about master Edward may not be true."
 </p><p> " Edward !" ejaculated Anne, " what of Edward ?"
 </p><p> " Oh !" replied Flora, in a very sorrowful tone, " he has told William
that he intends leaving us, and quitting England for ever."
  "He has told me so too," said Anne, in a tone more sorrowful than
the other; " and ever since he did so, I have never been able to think of
anything else: what can it mean ? Leave us-leave his home-leave all
he declared he loved !"
</p><p>  "Oh, these men," replied Flora, " are such strange unaccountable
creatures, that they seldom, if ever know themselves what their actions
mean ! And he has become so melancholy lately, and so thoughtful, and
so pale, and he's always sighing."  Anne heaved a sigh. "Yes, just
like that," said Flora; " I don't think, if he should go away, that he will
live long."
 </p><p> "Merciful Heaven !" exclaimed Anne, "what makes you say that ?"
 </p><p> " Because I think he will destroy himself. I often hear him, when
he doesn't know that I do hear him, ask himself what there is in this
life worth living for? and then he laughs; but it is such a melancholy
laugh; and then walks about; and, in fact, acts like a madman."








                                           <pb id="p.315" n="315"/>

 </p><p>  " If what you say be true," observed Anne, "there must be some good
cause for such strange conduct."
 </p><p>  "Oh, there's plenty of cause," said Flora, in a tone of voice that
seemed to imply she could tell a good deal more if she were asked; she
waited, but Anne spoke not; so as Flora had now determined to speak
out, she repeated the sentence, " Oh, there's plenty of cause."
  </p><p> Would that I knew were to look for it !" replied Anne.
  </p><p> "Look for it ?" observed the other, in a rather pert manner, " you
need not look far."
 </p><p>  "Not look far?" exclaimed Anne, enquiringly; "and pray where
should I look ?"
  </p><p> " In that glass," said the other, " and there you'll see the cause; and
quite cause enough, to my thinking."
 </p><p>  "I see my own face there," said Anne.
 </p><p>  "And that is the cause, and the only cause. Oh, my dear young mistress, it's no use mincing matters any longer-Edward  Osborne is
dying-yes dying of love for you."
 </p><p>  "For me !" exclaimed Anne, turning deadly pale; "that he loves me
is nothig new, nor is my love for him a novelty, but it has ever been
the simple love of a brother and a sister."
 </p><p>  "Yes, and so he thought," said Flora, "until that Master Lerue
opened his eyes; I'll tell you something about him, too, one of these
days."
</p><p>   " Lerue !" exclaimed Anne; "but what can he have to do with it ?"
 </p><p>  "He has had everything to do with it, and has done it all, and I am
very glad he has, for now we know the truth. Oh, that jealousy! that's
the thing for bringing out love. If Alyce Vaughan had never looked at
my William, I don't think I should have ever looked at him myself; but
the moment I thought it possible that that minx could take him away,
I couldn't stand that, so I took him away instead. It has been just the
same with Master Edward; while he could come and see you, and talk to
you, and know that no other good-looking fellow came near you, oh ! then
it was all comfortable enough -- then it was all brotherly love, do y'see;
but the moment he found a fine handsome young man, and we must all
own that Master Lerue is handsome enough to make even Edward tremble in such a case-yes, the moment Lerue shot the ruffian through the
head, it shot through the mind of Master Edward, that, perchance, the
next aim he might take, would be at something rather more tender than
an old robber: that shot was the cause of Edward's wounded heart, and
if something is not done to heal it, he'll die."
 </p><p> "But what can be done ?" enquired Anne, quite innocently.
</p><p>  "What can be done ? I'll tell you: you see, it is said that ' like cures
like;' for instance, a burnt finger is cured by holding it to the fire; now
if this is true in one thing, it may be true in another; so, if Master
Edward's heart has been wounded by love, why, let love be the plaster,
and do you put it on."
 </p><p> " You are now talking like a mad girl, Flora," replied Anne, at the
same time endeavouring to look rather angry; but as young ladies have
never yet been known to look really so, on account of being told that a
young man is in love with them, it seemed to Flora, that anger had for







<pb id="p.316" n="316"/>                     .

once put on a most lovely expression; " you are talking like a mad gir
-indeed you are; for supposing dear Edward, dear brother Edward, were
really hurt in the way you say, it is not becoming in the physician
to thrust himself forward, and offer a prescription unasked. Indeed,
indeed Flora," she went on, but at every word, the lovely smile and rosy
tint that had for a moment adorned her cheek, faded away, and by the
end of her speech she had sunk into a perfect sadness, " indeed you are
wrong; Edward has never by word, or look, or deed, betrayed to me that
feelings different to those we felt for each other in childhood, had taken
possession of his heart."
 </p><p>  " Oh, dear! oh, dear ! oh, dear!" interrupted Flora, "you young
 ladies are uncommonly dull of apprehension, or dreadful hypocrites.
 Can eyes speak-and do they ever speak ? Can sighs tell tales-and do
 they ever tell tales ? Indeed they do, and sometimes such as are not
 quite true either.  Can words-and do words, that are intended for
 crossness, sometimes betray their speaker, and show that kindness, nay,
 love, was at the bottom of the feeling which prompted them. All this would
 apply to Master Edward, and yet you tell me he has never, by word,
 look, or deed, told you that he loves you. But I have another proof, if
 another proof were wanting, and one that no one would be bold enough
 to question -look here !" As she said this, she took from a sort of pocket
 a sheet of paper, which she unfolded, and held up by the two corners,
 as a flag of triumph. " Did ever a young man, and does ever a young
 man, write poetry if he isn't in love! The thing's impossible! for I have
 been told that there never was a line of poetry written worth the reading, that had not been penned with the hope to gain the praise of some
 fair maid- read that."
</p><p>   Anne took the paper, and read-THE DREAM OF LOVE.
 </p><p>  " Why this," she said, " is the old song you read to us before."
 </p><p>  " I called it an old one, just to vex and perplex the young poet; but
it is a right down new ditty, and Edward is the author."
 </p><p>  She then told Anne how it came into her possession, and then Anne
read it, and Anne admired it; and then Flora began to find all sorts of
faults with it; and then Flora said that having shewn it to her young
mistress, she might as well burn it. And Anne thought so too, but
forgot to give up possession of it; but kept it in her hand on her lap,
and started off quite lively upon a very different subject, and entered
into all sorts of plans for making her poor old friend at the farm happy;
and then she sent Flora down to the parlour to see that all was safe, for
she really thought she heard a strange noise there.
 </p><p> As Flora heard no strange noise, she at once went down without the
least alarm.
 </p><p> The moment she was gone, Anne looked upon the song with one of
her sweetest smiles; and dare we tell what she then did ?-she kissed
it, and then carefully, but quickly folding it, placed it in her bosom,
just as Flora returned.
 </p><p> The first thing Flora noticed to herself, as she entered, was the disappearance of the paper; but being a woman herself, she gave a tolerable
shrewd guess what its fate had been, so said nothing.
</p><p>  Anne had not talked so rapidly as she now did, for no one knew when;








                                           <pb id="p.317" n="317"/>

and Flora feeling certain that she had put the spark to the right train,
took the first opportunity of bidding her lovely young mistress, good
night, and left the room.  As she did so, she said to herself-" They
shall be married, I'm determined."
 </p><p> Anne now being free from observation, let loose to her most hidden
feelings.--" Why have I been thus blind so long ?" she exclaimed; " he
loves me, but believes I love not him: and do I ? I am asking myself
a dangerous question. What if I answer-no. Then he will quit us for
ever, and will, when absent, soon forget me. Forget me! I could not
bear him to do that; but if I love him not, why should I wish for his
remembrance."
</p><p>  She again drew forth the paper, and once more read the song--" And
that Flora, too," she said, "to abuse these lines: I thought she had
better taste. I can find no fault in them-none. If a new affection, or,
perhaps one, but newly made manifest to me, had not sprung up within my
heart, why has that heart been so miserably sad ever since the hour he
talked of parting from me ? Let me try myself by supposing that he were
really gone, really gone for ever, what would my feelings be then ?" She
waited not long for the answer, for the question had burst open the floodgates of her heart; the hitherto pent up stream of pure affection rushed to
her eyes, and thence escaped in a violent flood of tears; all the efforts she
made to stay them seemed but to add new waters to the fountains of
her heart. She buried her head in her fair hands, as they held the song,
which was soon nearly obliterated by the sweetest stream that ever
hallowed a poet's verse.
</p><p> She had remained some time lost in thought, when she murmered-
" I know it-I know I love him now !" and as she said this she kissed
the writing; just as she had done so, she was startled by her door opening gently, and Flora entering.
 </p><p> "Hush !" said Flora, placing her finger on her lip;" hush! I'm sure I
heard it !"
  </p><p>" Heard what ?" enquired Anne, in the same fearful subdued tone, for
Flora's manner had suddenly alarmed her.
 </p><p> "The sound of voices in the grounds behind the house," said Flora.
"Shall I arouse Edward and the Cripple, for I feel certain there is some
danger near at hand ? It was not a passing sound, as of late-wayfarers
journeying over the Heath, but a kind of subdued murmur, as of persons
secretly plotting close to the house. I had heard nothing until, by accident, I had extinguished my light. If there are robbers, they have
been waiting until they are sure all have retired to rest."
 </p><p> " Talk not of robbers, Flora; it cannot be: your fears have deceived
your ears. We will first be certain, at all events, before we alarm
others. Place the lamp out of sight in yonder cupboard, and I will descend
with you, and learn the truth."
</p><p>  Neither Anne nor Flora were wanting in courage; but as they quitted
the room on tiptoe, and in darkness, they could not prevent a trembling
seizing upon them; as they went along a gallery the moon shone
brightly, which greatly reassured them, and they approached the casement; all was still in that direction; the fields and hedges seemed
clothed in silver, so brightly did the moon light up the scene. They







<pb id="p.318" n="318"/>                   .

now descended the stairs with firmer steps, for both were by degrees
becoming more and more assured that all was well; they listened at
every door, that led towards the outside of the dwelling, but all was still;
there was but one more place to examine-the kitchen: this opened on a
sort of farm-yard, and was now in perfect darkness; they lifted the latch
of the door; all was still; they entered; when suddenly, without
speaking a word, they seized each other's hands, and stood petrified; for
now there no longer remained a doubt.  They heard a strange, low,
peculiar sound, as of something placed against the outer door, which
seemed to be turning, and turning, but very slowly and carefully, as
though to cause as little noise as possible; in another moment a blow
came against the door, as the part that had been worked upon had given
way; something was now withdrawn, and now they plainly saw a
round hole in the door; and then the same sort of sound was repeated
at a little distance from the hole.
 </p><p> Not a moment was to be lost; as quickly as their trembling
limbs would bear them, they hastened, Flora to arouse Edward-Anne
to awaken the Cripple-of-the-Bridge.
 </p><p> It was some little time before either of the sleepers could be made
conscious that danger was at hand; as soon as this was made clear to them,
a few moments more and they came forth, bearing all the arms they could
muster. What was to be done ? Flora was sure, she said, " that there
were numbers of assailants, for when she first heard them, it was not the
sound of a single voice, but rather the murmuring of many." Resistance,
under such circumstances, seemed hopeless, but still neither Willy-of-the
Bridge nor Edward were men to give in without a struggle: what
would they not then have given at that moment, for the aid of William
and the merchant ?  At first, it seemed impossible that they could even
alarm the people of the farm, until Anne proposed, nay insisted, upon
making the trial herself; the direct road lay across the yard wherein the
robbers were, therefore that way was impossible; but it struck her that
by leaving the house by the front, and then going round creeping along
beneath the hedges, she might by chance attain her end, and bring,
although but scanty aid, yet, sufficient to do some good, and enable
them  to hold out until the farm  servants might call in other assistance. Willingly would Edward, or the Cripple, have undertaken this
perilous affair, but they felt, too truly, that all hope lay in their remaining where they were. Cautiously did Anne now leave the dwelling--
they watched her steal along, until a turning hid her from their sight;
then the Cripple, with Edward, stole to the kitchen, through the door
of which they now perceived several holes all close together.
</p><p>  "Shall I fire through the door ?" said Edward, in a whisper.
  " Not yet," replied the Cripple; " the few shots we can fire must take
effect, or we are lost: when that piece of the door is removed, you will
see an arm pushed through to undo the fastenings-take a sure aim, and
one, at least, will bite the dust."
</p><p>  Scarcely had the Cripple uttered these word;, when the piece of the door
was broken away, and an arm did appear-one flash, and a horrid cry
told how truly Edward had taken his aim; this done, the robbers hearing the report, and finding, by one of their fellows falling dead,







                                          <pb id="p.319" n="319"/>

 that secrecy was now of little use, shouted, and muttering the vilest
 execrations against all within, began to batter at the door with
 heavy beams of wood; strong as the door was, it was evident that a few
 moments would suffice for its destruction; there was no hope now of
 escape by the front, for they heard a voice calling aloud to surround the
 house, and not let even a rat escape alive.
  </p><p> The uproar that ensued soon brought Alyce and the other females down
in frightful alarm; the door gave way, Edward and the Cripple fired upon
the robbers, and then retreated, followed by the assailants, the principal
robber calling aloud to the fugitives, and telling them, " that had they
not fired, and killed their men, they should merely have taken what
they could get, and have left all lives safe, but now, that not one
should escape to tell that night's tale.' Knowing there would be no time
to reload their pistols, they reserved their fire for the last extremity, and
the Cripple having found his staff, laid more than one ruffian bleeding
upon the ground. From room to room  they fought with desperation;
Edward had flown to his own, and had armed himself with a sword;
the screams and shouts were frightful; despair had now seized upon even
the Cripple, who at one moment thought to fly to Eoline, and with his own
hand end her life, rather than let her fall into the power of the wretches
who were calling out to fire the place.
 </p><p> Who can picture the scene which now ensued; despair on one side,
brutal triumph on the other; the dreaded moment of conquest seemed
already come, when the last kind of relief that could have entered into
the mind of either Edward or the Cripple, suddenly appeared in the shape
of soldiers armed to the teeth; but what caused in Flora's mind still
greater surprise, was to see the soldiers led on by her own dear William.
  At the moment of their appearance, Edward, who had, as we have
said, retired to his room and armed himself with a sword, was in the
act of thrusting it into the heart of one of the robbers who had endeavoured to cut him  down with an axe. As the man fell backwards
down the stairs, the Bridge--shooter, who, having rescued Flora from the
grasp of the head robber, shot him dead.
 </p><p> The house was now filled with armed men, wounded and dying
robbers, and women on their knees, offering up thanks for their unlooked-
for preservation.  The few thieves that remained were soon marched
off; those that had escaped were being hotly pursued in various directions over the Heath. What a different scene now began ! All the farm
servants were busy, and laughing, and preparing all kinds of refreshments for their deliverers. The cressets were stuck around the cottage,
as if for a triumphant illumination. So powerful had been the revulsion of feelings from despair to joy, that no one appeared quite in their
senses.  Flora kept hugging William, till he felt quite ashamed of her;
but as others seemed as mad as she, it did not matter much at such a
moment. At last, Edward, who had been to see to the comforts of their
deliverers, having returned, enquired where Anne was ? Strange as it
may seem, it had never occurred to any one that she was not there.
Flora believed she was in her own room, doubtless offering up a prayer
of thankfulness; but Alyce, feeling anxious, hastened to the room, and
found it empty.  This caused serious fears. All were in a state of



<figure id="fig.00019" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.030.DO01.00019"><head>An Attack at the Cottage.</head> </figure>



<pb id="p.320" n="320"/>                   .

bustle, and hurrying here and there. Every nook in the place was examined, but she was no where to be found. But what added still more
to the strangeness of her disappearance, was the circumstance of her
not having seen or heard of at the farm. All that were questioned upon
this point declared, that she had never been there at all. Where could
she be ? A dreadful thought struck upon Edward's mind, that perhaps
she had fallen by an assassin's hand. In a moment a new search was
made. The cressets were all siezed upon, and not finding her any
where near the cottage, different parties sallied forth over the Heath.
 </p><p>  As the old man of the show took up his staff, determined to aid in
the search after his benefactress, the whole scene near Tybourne Tree was
recalled forcibly to his mind. He looked over the Heath-the lights
were moving about in every direction, as the like had happened years
ago, when Nan and her crew were seeking for Anne. How fervently
did he pray, that on this night, as on that, that he might be by Heaven selected to be the saviour of the lost child. On and on he trudged,
not quickly, but full of hope, for he felt sure, that some good would come
from his endeavours to save her, who had so recently saved him.
 </p><p>  After walking a long time, he was surprised to see, within the ruins
of the chapel, which he had nearly reached, several lights, but he was
sure they were not the lights carried by any of those searching for the
lost girl, for they moved not.
 </p><p>  He approached to one of the ruined windows, and looked in upon a
strange and awful scene.  In the centre was a grave, and on each side
of which was placed a coffin; the one was much smaller than the
other, but both were covered in the same manner, and both were very
plain. Some half dozen rustic-serving looking men stood by, who acted
as real mourners, for their honest faces had many a tear upon them. At
the head of the grave stood a man, reading from a book, the service of
the dead in English; he had no robes, or official vestments upon him,
but had a look of deep and earnest devotion painted upon his countenance.
</p><p>  The old man seeing this, felt at once the truth, that this was some
Protestant funeral.  He took from his head his cap, and stood motionless. The feeling came over him, as if he were attending the last sad
office of taking farewell, an eternal farewell, of some dear friend.
 </p><p> The ceremony was just ended; the larger coffin too, was soon deposited
in its endless home. As the smaller one was just being lifted over the
aperture, the old man was made to start, by hearing a violent crying
came from one corner of the ruins; he turned his gaze that way, and
saw a country lad in violent grief, who, as the coffin descended, exclaimed, " Oh, my poor young missus, I shall never see her again, bless
her! I shall never see her again-no, never, bless her !"
</p><p>  The old man was greatly moved at this simple but heartfelt grief of
the poor lad, so much so, that, anxious as he was to aid in the search for
Anne, he could not resist a feeling of curiosity to learn who had then
gone to their home, and whose death could have caused such grief to
the country lad.
</p><p>  When the grave had been filled up, the lad, leaving the ruins by one
side, as the others quitted the place in an opposite direction, was followed







                                          <pb id="p.321" n="321"/>

 by the old man.-" My good boy," he said, " you must have
 lost a friend that was very.dear to you, to make you cry thus
 violently ?"
  </p><p>  Hoiy," replied the boy, " indeed I have; and you'd a cried too, if
  you'd a' know'd my young missus, bless her !" and the boy blubbered
  again louder than before.
 </p><p>   " And who was your mistress ?" asked the old man.
 </p><p>   "Young Missus Lillia, of the Ferry. Ho, ho! dang me, but you
 would a' cried too, had you'd known her-bless her! and only to think
 that she should die, and her father should die, and all just when he had
 got a new name, and a great heap of money."
 </p><p>   " A new name, and a heap of money ! and what was his new name,
 eh, my good lad ?"
 </p><p>   " Algernon Mortley-so they says."
  </p><p>  "Algernon Mortley!" exclaimed the venerable inquirer; "how
 strange! why, that was my own brother's name."
 </p><p>   "No ! was it, though ?" said the boy, opening his eyes and his mouth,
 as he stared up in the old man's face; "by gumtion, wouldn't it be rum,
 an' youwere to turn out to be your brother's brother! if you bes'
 an' wont you be plaguy rich, neither-for they says he would have had a
 ocean of money. Do you come with me to the Ferry, for there's a
 chap comed from London who can tell'e all about it. Why, if you're his
 brother, you're my young missus's uncle, and if you are, oh do, let me
 be your lad, only for her sake, bless her ! will 'e ?"
  </p><p> The old man, thinking the lad's advice anything but bad, determined
 to hasten to the Ferry; but in their way they would pass the cottage,
 and inquire what success had happened.
  </p><p> When he reached the cottage, he learnt that but few had yet returned, and those few with ill success.  Thinking, that while making
 inquiries into the strange chance which had perhaps, revealed to him the
 fate of his elder brother-who had in early life fled from home, rather
 than enter into a marriage he loathed, and had, until that day, never
 been heard of again-he might do good by giving the alarm at the
 Ferry of the missing girl, he hurried on with the lad.
 </p><p>  When they arrived there, the person from London had gone back
 again, so that for this night it was impossible to make further progress
 in his own affairs.
 </p><p>  He now inquired who had been passing by the Ferry that night, and
 who had arrived ?
  </p><p> " Why, the first that came," said the man in charge of the Ferry,
 "were ill looking fellows, in cloaks, and who hadn't a civil word for any
 one: they rowed their own boat, and tied it to a place a little lower
 down there, and then went towards the Heath; then, after this came a
 guard of honour to sleep here, and be ready in the morning to receive the
 Lord High Admiral, who's coming to these parts on his way to- oh, I
forget where; and then came the young fellow that belongs to Master
Allen at the cottage; he came along like mad, for in his boat there were
six of the stoutest rowers I have ever seen: and was he not glad to
see the soldiers, and they seemed glad to see him; for after having









<pb id="p.322" n="322"/>                     .

  said something to the captain of guard, they were all alive in a minute,
  and off they started, at double quick time."
  </p><p>  Upon hearing this, the old man saw plainly how the aid had come
  so opportunely to the cottage, and saved all their lives.--" And has no
  one gone away ?" he inquired.
  </p><p>  " Not from the Ferry," said the man; "but the boat that was down
  there, belonging to the two strange fellows, that's gone: and my boy
  says, they brought something with them, that looked like a long bale of
  goods. I wonder if they've been out on the thieve ?"
</p><p>    The old man, not being able to gain any further information, now
  strolled back towards the Cottage. As he went along, he met Osborne
  and the Bridge-shooter: to them he related all he had heard at the Ferry,
  and also the strange circumstance of the double funeral at the ruined
  chapel.
</p><p>    Every endeavour to discover the lost Anne proved abortive, and with
 saddened hearts the three returned to the Cottage of the Heath.
</p><p>    As may be supposed, Alyce was inconsolable, and passed the remainder of the night in the most abject grief. All her former sufferings, at
 the first loss of her child, now came upon her with redoubled pain.
 Upon the former occasion there was some clue to guide them; the
 visit of the strange woman explained at once, that the child had been
 stolen; but now all was doubt and horrible conjecture. Could she have
 fallen into the deep well ?--even that spot was searched, but without
 avail.
</p><p>   Late as the night was, Edward and the Bridge-shooter determined to
 hasten away to London, to acquaint the merchant with the dreadful
 news. The inmates of the cottage were safe enough now, for several ot
 the soldiers mounted guard, and the rest were to remain until the morning at the farm. So, taking a hurried leave of their friends, Edward
 and his trusty companion started upon their midnight journey.
</p><p>   As they travelled along, the Bridge-shooter informed young Osborne
 of the manner in which he had been so happily made the instrument
 of their rescue from the attack of the robbers.--" For once," said he, "I
 must own, old mother has been as good as a witch; and I'll call her what-
 ever names she likes after this.  You must know, that this afternoon,
 down she sent for me, and such a message, that there was no denial to
 be offered, so off to her I went. ' Where is the merchant ?' said she.
</p><p> ' Out,' said I, ' and won't be at the Bridge till the morning. ' Then you
 must act for him. Ask no questions, but hurry down to the river, get
 six of the strongest rowers you can, tell them to pull for their lives,
 and convey you to Putney; when there, get what aid you can, and
 hasten to the cottage : they must not save their own breath, or the breath
 of those they go to save may already have past into death. I wanted
 some further explanation; 'but,' she said, ' this is no folly of mine, as
 some of my whims are; but do as I tell you, or the deep curse of a
 mother shall be yours !' So determined did she appear, that I at once
 made up my mind to fulfil her commands. ' Kiss me, good lad,' she
 said, when she saw I would do her bidding; 'and this much I can
re eal-     Cottage will this night be attacked, and plundered, if
nothing worse should happen, unless you be there before the clock shall

sound the eleventh hour of night.' Off I started, got my rowers,
staunch and true; the tide was with us, and gallantly we cut along.
All the rest you know."
 </p><p>  They now entered the boat, and as they had the same rowers, and
the tide having turned in their favour, rapidly did they float o'er the
silver waters. As they were just off where the Southwark Bridge now
spans the Thames, they passed a boat, going on but at a sluggish pace;
two men were rowing, and at the bottom of the boat lay something not
unlike a dead body, wrapped round with sailcloth.
 </p><p>  " What cheer, friends ?" called out the Bridge-shooter.
</p><p>   No answer was returned; but both the men stopped pulling, and then
turned the head of the boat, as if about to land; but seeing
the boat with the six rowers, now far a-head, the men put again into
their former course, and passed on. When they arrived at Old London
Bridge, the two men fastened the boat to the sterling, under the arch
beneath the Cardinal's Hat; a signal being given, the trap above
was opened, and a ladder let down. A man was seen holding a torch
from the trap-door-that man was Brassinjaw. One of the men in
the boat, unwrapping the sailcloth, lifted up the senseless form of a
female, and thus laden, began to ascend the ladder; the other man
remained in the boat to steady it-this was Nino, the Italian ; the
first was Spikely.  We need scarcely say, that the senseless form he
carried, was that of the lovely Anne.</p>

" NATURES never alter," said Nan, addressing Horton; " a rat's a rat,
and a rogue's a rogue from first to last; it is knowing this which makes
me guard myself against you."
 </p><p> " In this you wrong me, aunt," replied Horton, using the word aunt
for the first time, and as he pronounced it he looked at her kindly, but
Nan appeared not to have heard the word, nor to have marked his hypocritical look; "for you are my aunt you know, Nanny," he repeated,
pronouncing the name still louder, " that's certain enough."
 </p><p> ' I am not proud of the relationship," she replied, "nor do I aught to
serve you out of love; I am tired and weary of the life I have so long
led, and if you keep your faith with me-and I'll take pretty good care
you shall do so-the moment I have been paid for the work I have done,
you will see no more of me: but now to business. What I could prove,
and what I will prove, are widely different affairs: I am the only living
being who knows who and what you are; therefore I could ruin your

<pb id="p.324" n="324"/>                    .

hopes did I please to do so. I am the only living being who can prove
the death of Eoline, the real child of Horton: there was one other, whom
I always did suspect, knew the truth of Eoline's birth; but she too, I can
prove is dead."
 </p><p> "Then you are sure not one besides yourself escaped the storm ?"
 </p><p> "Not one ! Oh, it was a dreadful night! How strange it was that after
so long a wandering abroad that I should chance to be in the same ship
returning to England with those whom alone you had to fear, and that
of all on board, I alone should be saved to bring you tidings of their
certain death."
 </p><p> " Then you can swear you saw Eoline perish?" said Horton, once again
asking the question she had so often before answered.
 </p><p> " Have I not told you a dozen times, that when the vessel went to
pieces upon the sands, I and the old abbess alone were carried away in
the shattered boat: she was not so strong as I, and soon sank to the bottom of the boat, where I believe she died, just before I was tossed from
it, as it struck against a ship that was driving before the wind. I caught
hold of a piece of wreck that floated by, and by its aid was borne to the
shore just as my strength was failing me. But enough of that; now tell
me, and tell me clearly, for my brain seems rusting fast, how the case
really stands, and why, if you are regarded as Horton's only son, Eoline,
even had she been in truth your sister, should be such a stumbling
block in your way."
 </p><p> " Why, thus stands the whole affair," replied Horton; " you see that
when my father, I mean old Andrew Horton, died, it was discovered
that he had left all his property in trust; this was done, as his will
alleged, on account of the irregularities and depravity of his only son
Henry, that is, myself: the love he bore for his blind child never left
him, nor would he ever believe but that one day she would be discovered,
and under this idea, his will was made, and to her was left the bulk of
his wealth-to me, barely sufficient to prevent starvation, at least until
I should have grown older, and, as he said, wiser. There was a clause
that if his daughter should not be found by a certain date, but a very
distant one it was, or that the death of the child could be proved, why
then, as he had no other relation in the world, the property might come
to me. Suspecting something of his intentions, I managed to steal this
will, leaving a blank document sealed up in its stead; I knew that if
he died without a will, everything must be mine; it was but a boy's
trick, and only proved the wish to out-maneuvre without the sense to
accomplish the scheme-what was the use of destroying the will, unless
we destroyed at the same time the maker of that will?  As I ought to
have known it would be, the cheat was soon discovered, but the old
wretch never hinted to me that he had detected the theft, and I doubt
not, used to chuckle within himself to think how he had done the doer.
When he died, oh, how I wept! just as a dutiful son must weep for a
kind departed sire who has left him immense wealth. I thought that
every golden sovereign was worth a tear, so I shed abundance, for I
knew how rich he was. But my grief was soon ended, for when I presented myself as the sole heir, up started a new claimant in the shape of
a man of law, who, to my confusion, produced the very counterpart of







                                       <pb id="p.325" n="325"/>
the will I had stolen, and which, although I had not myself destroyed
I knew had been destroyed by others. He took possession of everything as sole trustee, so that my only chance of inheritance lay in
patiently waiting until my hair had lost its colour, and my eyes their
light, so distant was the date at which I might inherit, for it lay
with me to prove the death of Eoline: now here arose another difficulty;
the old abbess, as you rightly suspected, did know the truth of Eoline's
parentage, and to keep her out of my power, wedded her to the Cripple,
thus casting my hopes farther off than ever; I attempted his destruction
by an accusation of heresy, but he eluded the snare, and I lost sight of him
for years; my strange meeting with you has revealed their fates to me, and
I now ride once more upon the sunny flood of hope: from letters I possess,
written by the abbess, the identity of Eoline can be shown; your evidence will prove her death, and that of her husband-so you see, Nanny,
your old age may be a happy one, if wealth can make it so."
  </p><p>" The wealth of a virtuous memory alone brings happiness to age, and
not possessing that," she replied, " gold brings comfort but to the body,
not the heart.-And when shall I have to shew myself in the light of day?"
 </p><p> " Immediately," replied Horton; "all has been prepared, and now
you have no fear of meeting him," and he involuntarily glanced round
the room, as if to be sure no one was there, for at that moment he
plainly saw, in his mind's eye, the whole horrid scene he had enacted
when stabbing Spikely on the battle field; "no, you have nought to
fear, so that now you have money, a more seemly dwelling will better
befit your new station, and some attire of a newer cut than these worn
and tattered vestments. Come, come, cheer up, old girl-bright days are
in store!"
 </p><p> " I begin to feel," said Nan, " that to an active mind, repose is less
endurable than fatigue. While I knew not from one hour to another
where my home would be, the mind was buoyant from excitement; he who
is always seeking, always hopes to find, and in hope, not in possession,
lies what we call happiness; my life for years had been that of shifts and
stratagems-the one day hoping to find the wherewithal to keep life and
soul together-the next, to find a refuge to protect myself against him
who would have torn that life and soul asunder; but now, already do
I feel the end has come-where shall I for the future look for that excitement, which alone brings an opiate to the memory of the wicked ?
Priests tell us there is comfort in confession If I could but think so  "
 </p><p>  " Why, Nanny! Nanny !" exclaimed Horton, " I verily believe, were
nunneries not prohibited, Nanny would become a nun !"
 </p><p>  " There are worse than she, have made an end as good," replied Nan.
</p><p>"I have thought of that ere now. But first let us finish the job in hand,
before I enter upon a labour so immense as that of working out my own
redemption. When will the trial come on ?"
 </p><p>  " Almost immediately," replied Horton, "so Nanny, girl, be ready;
put on your best looks and your best gear; for as you are my only witness, we must make the most of you. I must leave you now," he said,
rising, " for I have to meet my counsel, the celebrated Thunderdown;
had our opponent but obtained his aid, I should have trembled for our
chance; there are few witnesses can stand his cross questionings; and







<pb id="p.326" n="326"/>                     .

there are circumstances, Nanny, connected with your life, that are as.
well kept in the shade; all will depend upon the credence given to your
testimony; so we must make you appear as bright and open as the day
to judge and jury; your having been abroad so long will render it very
unlikely that you should be recognised under your new name and altered
appearance.
 </p><p> " There was but one I feared," said Nan, " and he is dead; so all will
go well, depend on't."
 </p><p> Horton now retired to attend his appointment with the celebrated
Sergeant Thunderdown, whom he found in high spirits at the anticipated
triumph he should achieve in the coming trial.  "At last," he said,
chuckling, and rubbing his hands, " at last I shall have the long-wished
for opportunity of putting an extinguisher upon that detestable Whistlepipe; it is a very extraordinary fact, Master Horton, but ever since the
trial of Miles for the weaver's murder, which you doubtless remember
happened many years ago, this will be the first time in which Whistlepipe has been opposed to me; I have never forgiven him for that day's
work, nor ever will, at least until I have made him look as small as his
own contemptible little bit of putty of a nose. I shall conduct the whole
affair in a jocular vein, but biting, sir, biting; I can scarcely refrain,
even now, from laughing at the figure he'll cut when I compel the judge to
smile, and I can do it, yes, yes, sir, I can do it, and make the jury laugh,
but that I can always do; and then set the whole court in a roar, yes,
sir, in a roar, at his expense. You see our case is so clear, that one
may venture to give loose to the reins of our wit, and when I do, even
the judge can seldom find a curb sufficiently strong to restrain it.  Poor
Whistlepipe ! I hope I shall not break his heart; no, no, I'll carry my
sarcasms to the very verge of annihilation, and then let the.gentle hand
of pity stay my caustic tongue." Horton would rather have heard a
little more about his own affairs, than of nothing but the spiteful attack
intended for the opposing counsel; but as the serjeant had said their case
was so clear, he left him with a confident mind.
  </p><p>When the merchant heard of all that had happened at the cottage,
and of the second loss of his child, his agony was extreme; he at
once believed that she had been murdered by the robbers; all hope of
again beholding his adored child in life was now for ever past. As
Edward and the Bridge-shooter, who were little less affected than Master
Hewet, were endeavouring to console the bereaved father, by raising
hopes which they themselves believed not in, they were told that a seafaring man was waiting below and wanted to see the merchant. Edward
feeling how impossible it would be for their master to receive any stranger,
overwhelmed as he was with grief, descended to enquire whether he
might not do as well as the merchant.  He had been gone but a very
few minutes, when he returned, but without entering the room further
than the door, he beckoned to the Bridge-shooter, who quietly left the
room.
</p><p>  " You must go immediately with this man," said Edward, " whereever he may take you; he is a Dutch sailor, and jumbles his own
language with the few words he knows of ours in such a manner, that
it is hopeless to discover what he really means, further than that somebody






                                           <pb id="p.327" n="327"/>

 belonging to Merchant Hewet, is wanted    immediately upon
 affairs of moment.  It appears he had a letter for the merchant, but
 has let it fall over the Bridge and lost it."
  </p><p> The Bridge-shooter, who, as we have before seen, never stayed to dispute any order given him by Edward, made a very few minutes suffice
 for his preparation, and immediately started off with the Dutch sailor.
  </p><p> When Osborne returned to the merchant's room, he found him much
 more composed; the first flood of grief was past away, and he now
 determined at once to leave the Bridge and hasten to the Heath, that
 he might give whatever little comfort lay in his power to his beloved
 Alyce.
   </p><p>" And, besides," he said, "I must not forget, in giving way to the
 grief of a father, the duties of a man. I have much to say to Willy
 concerning Eoline, which if delayed may be their ruin. I had but just
 before my return learnt strange things regarding their affairs, and I
 came overjoyed at the discovery I had made, when your fatal news sunk
 my heart deep into despair."
  </p><p> When the merchant had gone, Edward gave way to his own wretched
 feelings.  If he had formerly been unconscious of his love for Anne, he
 was so no longer; her loss, although he felt convinced she never could
 have been his, drove him almost to madness. Willingly would he have
laid down his own life, could he have restored her to her once happy
home.-" I fear me much," he said, as he sat musing upon all that had
lately occurred, " yes, I fear me much, that the horrid idea of her murder,
which has taken possession of the merchant's mind, is but too well
founded. Why did I permit her to leave the cottage ? Better that we
had all died together, than that she should have been thus sacrificed, and
by me too. How dreadful is that thought-I, who would have died for her,
have been her murderer! Yes, 'tis I, 'tis I who have destroyed her !"
He clasped his hands in agony; he paced the room with uneven, but
hurried steps  " If the robbers killed her, why have they hidden their
bloody work ?"  This thought, for a moment seemed to him as a flash of
inspiration-" No, no," he exclaimed, "she may yet live; had we
found her mangled corse," and he shuddered from head to foot-the
bare idea of looking upon that sweet form, weltering in blood, seemed
too appalling for the mind to conceive-" then indeed," he continued, " we
might have given way to despair, for certainty then had dug the grave
of hope; but hope still lives, and I will hope yet.  Why has net Willy
sent me some message ? only one word, even though that word had announced hope's certain death, had been better than this suspense.
Hark !" he exclaimed, and then listened; " more than once I have fancied
that a frenzied cry, as of some demented woman, has passed through
these walls fRom the next dwelling. A strange place for a female to
abide in--that sink of drunkenness and vice! I fear me there are strange
scenes enacted there. I am almost certain I saw the very man who
left us the dagger so mysteriously, come from that house; but the day
had scarcely broken, and my mind was too troubled to see aught clearly;
besides, at that instant I could have believed each fleeting fancy of the
brain was fixed reality."
  </p><p> He remained for a time lost in thought, picturing to himself all the







<pb id="p.328" n="328"/>                  .

early scenes in which he had been so happy as a boy, when first he had
watched the tottering steps of the baby Anne. He had loved her  from
the first, but little dreamt he then that that child would one day be his
heart's sole hope, and yet that heart's despair. All at once he was
startled from his reverie, by hearing a strange voice close to his ear exclaim--" Be'st asleep, maister Ed'ard ? so they tells I you be called."
</p><p> Osborne looked towards the speaker, and there saw the country boy
he had often observed about the Ferry-house at Putney.
 </p><p> "And what want you, my good lad ?" enquired Edward.
 </p><p> "Oh, nothing, only you," replied the other. " Hoiy comed from the
odd-looking chap that's now at the Cottage on the Heath."
 </p><p> Edward starting up, asked anxiously, " Had they found her ?"
 </p><p> " No, not exactly her," said the boy; "but they a' found a summut
which hoiy'm to give to you, for you to give to Master Allen, who they
now says is'nt Master Allen; it all seems plaguy rum  to hoiy; there
was my poor old maister that's dead and gone, father to pretty Lillia,
who's dead and gone too, bless her! he turned out to be some one else
I shouldn't wonder, dang me if I should, to find that hoiy'm not Bill
Bolterhead, but some great noble, or mayhap a prince-ha, ha, ha! for
nobody seems to be anybody now o' days."
 </p><p> But what is it you have to give me ? be quick, and close that monstrous mouth," said Edward, rather sharply.
 </p><p> " Oh ! here it be's," said the boy, producing a badge, such as were
then worn on the arm by serving men; as he gave it, he also delivered
a note hurriedly written by the Cripple, which was to the effect-"that
in again searching the line of road by which it was imagined that Anne
would have endeavoured to reach the farm-house unperceived by the
robbers in the rear of the cottage, they had found the ground much disturbed, as if a violent struggle had taken place there; more than one
piece of torn female attire also was found lying about, and in a hedge
through which a way had apparently been forced, the badge was discovered; it had evidently been torn violently from the arm, for attached
to it were portions of the sleeve upon which it had originally been
fastened."
</p><p>  When Osborne had dismissed the lad, he began to examine the badge
more attentively. "It is certainly strange," he said, "that such a
thing should be found in such a place; but I fear it will lead to no results favourable to our hopes: this is evidently the badge of the house
of Shrewsbury, and it is not likely that any servitors of that great family
would be linked with thieves; more likely one of their serving-men has
offended a coy, but saucy country wench, who for having her own dress
torn by his rough gallantries, has thus revenged herself on his. But,
good heavens!" he exclaimed, as his mind took a frightful turn, "if
Anne should have met with such a man, in such a place, and at that
dead hour of the night too."  He ceased to speak, for his thoughts became too horrid to give utterance to. As he stood gazing upon the badge
as he held it before him by both his hands, his eye fell upon the ring
young Lord George Talbot had given him some years before. "When
he gave me that, he pledged to me his word, that throughout my life, if
ever I should need his or his father's aid, I should not find them wanting.








                       <pb id="p.329" n="329"/>

 I remember well his parting words-' Farewell,' he said, ' and believe
 me, the promises a Talbot makes he keeps.' How little did I then
 think that I should ever wish to put such promise to the test, nor would
 I now were it to serve myself; but for her, oh ! what would I not do ?
 It will after all be no great favour to demand; but then it will clear
 away the doubt that haunts me. Not a moment shall be lost; I will to
 the Earl's and boldly crave an audience; in any case his power rust
 greatly aid our cause." With his mind filled from this new-found spring
 of hope, he hurried away towards the Earl of Shrewsbury's mansion,
 on the banks of the Thames.
</p><p>   How Anne had fallen into the hands of those who now held her close
 prisoner may be thus explained. Nino, who was an Italian of the worst
 description, had, by the aid of false keys, hiding in cupboards, and thus
 over-hearing things that were intended for very different ears, and sundry
 other rascally manoeuvres, wound out nearly all his young master's
 secrets; amongst the rest, the place of Talbot's retreat, when he had
 absented himself from his father's abode, in consequence of a dispute
 that had arisen between the son and sire concerning a matrimonial scheme.
 He was not long in discovering the attachment Lord George, while disguised as Walter Lerue, had formed for the trader's daughter of the
 Heath and immediately began to speculate upon the probability of turning
 the affair to his own benefit. With such contempt did he look upon all
 traders, that they appeared to him as so many animals, created but to minister to the pleasures of the great. Had he really known that simple Master
 Allen, was, in truth, no other but William Hewet, the King's own merchant, he might have been more cautious than to have ventured upon the
 last bold step he did. Once having made up his mind that something must
 be done to reinstate himself in the good graces of his young lord, whose
 estimation of him, lately, he felt had been greatly lowered, he determined to sacrifice the trader's daughter at the altar of his own advancement.--"You see," he said to Spikely, whom lie had made a participator
 in the vile plot; "you see that although Lord George would not condescend to ask my aid in such an affair, and would fain be thought too
honourable to sanction such a proceeding, he will, believe me, be mad
with joy, like a child with a doll, when he finds her snug beneath his
own roof; nor will he, any more than would a child, ask how the doll
had been obtained. This was a glorious thought of mine, and will bring
us a greater reward than we shall ever receive for anything-excepting,
perhaps, for our ridding him of her again when he's tired of her; there
are no two things a man will pay higher for, than the getting and getting
rid of a woman. I'll marry her myself, if he'll pay enough, and I can
dispose of Mona; but all that is an after matter-first we must get the
girl and the reward."
  </p><p> So trifling an affair did the abduction of a trader's daughter appear to
 these worthies, feeling, as they did, quite satisfied that no one would
 dare to make much stir in the matter, when it was known they were
 protected by so powerful a name as that of Shrewsbury, that they
 scarcely gave the subject a second thought until the time had arrived to
 put the scheme into execution.  There happened just at this juncture,
 a circumstance which at first caused Nino great annoyance, for in it








<pb id="p.330" n="330"/>

he saw much inconvenience to himself, and loss to his purse-this
was the unexpected dismissal of Mona from her employ, and that dismissal had been attended with such disgrace, that it was hopeless for
her to attempt to obtain a like position, at least where she was at all
known. In this extremity she had flown to her lover, Nino; and he, not
knowing what better to do with her, had persuaded Brassinjaw to allow
her to remain, for a time, at the " Cardinal's Hat."  Now, as in almost
every unpleasant affair, when we know there is no help for it, we generally manage to discover some little palliative-something that might
have been worse, and therefore, bad as it may be, it is still endurable,
so did Nino draw from out his annoyance a cause for satisfaction;
for it having struck him, as neither he, nor Spikely, nor, indeed,
Brassinjaw, were exactly calculated to act as lady's-maid to their intended victim, that Mona would be the very thing, and would aid them
greatly in the whole affair, as she, being a woman, would understand
how to attack all the weaker points of her own sex; and thus, either by
flattery, or fear, or by any means she might find most applicable at the
moment, render Anne subservient to their wills. When first Nino
broached the business to Mona, her Italian blood flew to her heart, and
filled it with jealousy, for nothing could persuade her but that the girl he
was about to bring there, was one of his own victims; nor did she, to the
last, give implicit credit to the tale they told her.
 </p><p> Fortunately for Anne, this very jealousy was a sort of safeguard to
herself; for at least it protected her from the insulting approaches of the
Italian ruffian.
 </p><p> Upon reflection Mona saw, that if, as she feared, her own charms had
lost their influence over her lover, and this new fancy of his were placed
within her reach, she should at least have the power of vengeance, if
her worst fears proved true. It was this thought, and this only, which
at last caused her to consent to the girl being brought there.
 </p><p> Fate seemed to be working in aid of their infamous plan, for it
happened that the very night they had fixed upon for visiting the Heath,
and watching their opportunity of seizing the girl and carrying her away,
was the same, which another party of wretches had chosen as a fitting
one, for committing the robbery of the Cottage.
</p><p>  By Anne having gone a very circuitous road to reach the Farm,
she had, by the very precaution she was taking to avoid danger, fallen
into one, that could she have known the truth, she would have regarded
with a thousand times more horror than the certainty of death by the
hands of the robbers.
 </p><p> Nino and Spikely were merely on a reconnoitering ramble, never
dreaming that at such an hour of the night, the very bird they came to
entrap, could by possibility have flown, as it were of her own accord,
into their very arms.
 </p><p> Anne having left the Cottage some distance behind, now flew forward
as swiftly as her limbs would carry her, and was just turning the corner
of a narrow lane, when she came suddenly upon the two wretches.
 </p><p> Nino caught her in his arms, exclaiming-" Holloa, my pretty wench,
whither so fast ? 'tis late at night for petticoats to be flying about the
fields-is it not ?"








                  <pb id="p.331" n="331"/>

 </p><p> "For mercy's sake!" exclaimed Anne, endeavouring with all her might
to free herself from his resistless grasp, " oh ! for mercy's sake do not,
do not detain me ! I am flying for help-robbers are at theCottage !"
  </p><p>" Diavolo !" ejaculated Nino, "it is the girl herself; quick, quick,
away with her! Fool! why do you scream and struggle so?      'Tis
useless to resist."
 </p><p> But Anne struggled on, and louder screamed than ever; for one
moment she freed herself, but her strength was gone, and falling in a
swoon upon the earth, became their unresisting prey.
 </p><p> When they had conveyed her to the boat, they watched for returning
animation; the moment life again appeared beginning to assert its sway,
they placed a draught to her lips; unconscious of what she did, she
swallowed it. It was a powerful narcotic. Soon did its mysterious
power lay to rest every feeling; and thus in a profound sleep was the
wretched Anne conveyed to Old London Bridge.</p>

</p><p>WHEN Edward Osborne reached the magnificent abode of the Earl of
Shrewsbury, he was greatly disappointed at hearing that neither the
Earl nor his son were there. It is true, one or the other was expected
daily, but the exact time at which they would arrive was unknown.
Lord George, he was given to understand, had suddenly sunk into a fit
of sadness so profound, that at certain moments even his physicians had
fancied it would end in madness the most incurable-that of fixed melancholy. The cause of this change not even those who knew him
best could account for; for now the reconciliation with his father had
been happily completed, there seemed more reason than ever that his
former gay and joyous disposition should not only resume its sway, but
shine forth with greater brilliancy than ever; the reverse being the case,
caused those around him to be lost in fruitless conjecture, and anxious
solicitude. The only relief he derived was from continually moving from
place to place; the moment the excitement of action ceased, the cloud
was again upon him.
</p><p>  What had annoyed Nino most, was that he himself was never
permitted to accompany his lord in these, his rambles after health-
health the most difficult to attain, that of the mind. After turning
over and over in his thoughts all the probable, as well as all the improbable reasons for his lord's strange manner, it struck Nino, as it would
have done any man who knew aught of the world, that if we examine
minutely into the causes of man's joys or miseries, there will always be
found a woman at the bottom of them. It was his having come to this
conclusion, that first gave him the idea, that it was not impossible that

time give a pictorial sketch of Bame Spikely's abode, when it will be
found in the possession of more worthy inhabitants than herself.
</p><p>  " Well, Nanny," said Horton, "the hour, the eventful hour has arrived,
and here am I to escort you to the Courts at Westminster. I have
brought a right sober nag for you, and with our half-dozen followers, we
shall show to the gapers no mean appearance."
 </p><p> When Nan arose, so becoming was her new attire, and so different to
that in which Horton had been accustomed to behold her, that a smile
of satisfaction mantled o'er his countenance.  "Why, Nanny," he exclaimed, "in putting on your new mourning, you have put on a new
youth. But I have noticed more than once in my life, the loss of a
husband or of a wife, is a great restorer of youth to the survivor-eh,
Nanny ?"
 </p><p> Nan merely sighed, and observed, " They had other things to think of
than quirks and jests."
 </p><p> " Well, perhaps, you are right," he replied; " it may be as well to
keep our store of mirth for a later hour of the day, when we shall have
had success to whet our wits. I wish I could see you smile, Nanny;
but I forget, widows must clothe their looks in sadness, although their
hearts be jumping with delight-looks can be seen, the heart never;
and lucky it is for most, that our breasts are not made of glass, or we
should often reveal what might make the face turn as red as the heart."
 </p><p>  They were soon in the street, when Horton, with infinite show of
respect placed Dame Spikely upon her horse, which she sat to perfection;
then mounting his own, they took their way towards Westminster.
 </p><p> When they had entered the court, Horton's previously-formed opinion
as to the intentions of the man of law, to whom Andrew Horton had
bequeathed his property in trust, were completely confirmed, for the
first person who held out his hand to him was this very trustee, whose
name was Gripclose.
</p><p>   "Master Horton," said Gripclose, " I hope before the trial begins,
you will exonerate me from any unworthy motive, or from any wish to
throw the slightest impediment in the way of the right receiving his
right-no, my young friend, no. But you see an honest man, like myself, is often placed in an awkward, nay, a painful position, by circumstances; and certainly the circumstances arising out of your father's will,
are enough to make my position painful. But all will no doubt be well;
and if you can prove all you have undertaken to prove, and which you,
no doubt, can prove, or you would not have come here, believe me, I
shall be the first, after the trial, to take you by the hand, as I do now
before it, to congratulate you heartily, and dine with you afterwards;
ha ! ha! ha! you see I am already looking out for a few of the crumbs
that may fall from the rich man's table. But I beg pardon -the lady ?"
And he made a profound bow to Dame Spikely.
 </p><p> " This worthy dame," replied Horton, " is the person who can, alas,
prove the death of my poor sister. How cruel was fate to keep her so
many years from my knowledge, and then, when I had found her, to
part us for ever in death."
</p><p>  " Painful indeed, painful indeed," said Gripclose, and at the same time
he wiped away a tear, which Horton observing, it struck him that a

the Beauty of the Heath might have something to do with Lord George'
melancholy.
 </p><p>  On this point he was not far wrong, but whether he saw the affair in
the right light or not, coming events will show. Judging by his own
nature, he at once made up his mind that if the pretty doll of the
Cottage was the cause of all the mischief, why, then possession was the
speediest cure, for in his eyes, possession of the coveted object was sure
to put an end to the malady of love, however strong the fit might have
been. But Nino looked further, at least he fancied he did, than the
mere relief he was to bring his master, for in the distance he saw a
Prodigious reward for himself. And now having the girl safe in his
clutches, he looked upon that reward as already on its road to his own
purse.
 </p><p>  Every few hours, Osborne was again on his way to the Earl's, but for
several days met with nought but disappointment. Time kept flying
on, but still no tidings of poor Anne. All the robbers who had been
taken were severely questioned, and in those days, to be severely questioned, meant severely tortured; but no evidence could be wrung from
them to lead to the conviction, that with her abduction they were in
the remotest degree connected.  The evidence of each, individually, bore
so strongly as to the truth of all, that it was quite clear they must look
in some other quarter for a solution of the mystery regarding Anne's
disappearance.
 </p><p>  How little did Osborne imagine, that every night, as he lay his burning
head upon his pillow, that head was within a few inches of her, whose
recovery now seemed the sole object of his life; but so it really was, for
in the very apartment of the Cardinal's Hat, which abutted upon his
own, there lay the poor sufferer, in a state of stupor, for the first few
hours, and for the next, under the influence of delirium, caused by the
violence of the drugs she had swallowed.
 </p><p>  All this time Horton was busily employed preparing for the coming
trial, which, now he had Nan to produce, he felt certain of gaining. There
was one circumstance which puzzled him greatly, and that was to observe
how coolly his opponent looked upon the affair; the only conclusion
he could bring his mind to was, that the opposing trustee, feelingthe
propriety of giving up the whole property to Horton, meant merely
to come into court as a matter of form, so that at no future time, let
what claimant soever spring up, he would no longer be liable to be called
upon to account for the disposal of the property; in fact the trial would
be his discharge in full.
 </p><p>  When the eventful morning arrived, on which he was to become
a wealthy man, he was early at the new abode of Dame Spikely,
for her husband being as she believed dead, she had openly taken his
name; here he stood before her door, with a retinue, if not vast in
numbers, still one which cut a most respectable figure.
 </p><p>  Having dismounted from his horse, he entered the dwelling. It was
a house of some pretension, standing at the corner of Chancery Lane,
opposite one of the palace-mansions of Cardinal Wolsey, and afterwards
of Henry the Eighth. A portion of this palace still remains, parts of
which are adorned by the usual Tudor ornaments. We shall at a future

like act on his own part would not be out of place, so he too gently
passed his hand across his eyes. Nan's lip curled up, but she said
nothing.
  </p><p> "Madam," said Gripclose, addressing Dame Spikely, "although I
stand in the position of an opponent to the son of my lamented friend,
Andrew Horton, I hope you will permit me the honour of leading you
to the seat reserved for you, until you are called on to give evidence."
Gripclose led Dame Spikely courteously to a seat, and his own having
been the next, he very politely begged Horton to accept it, that he
night be near his witness, and then retired.
 </p><p>  " You see, Nanny," said Horton softly, but in a tone that evinced
how pleased he was with the reception he had met with from Gripclose,
" you see it is exactly as I told you it would be; we shall have merely
to give our account of the wreck, and all will be over."
</p><p>   "Be not too sure of that," replied Nan; "had he appeared angry,
or sullen, or spiteful even, I should have liked it better; but that grinning amiability I never yet found to bode much good to those upon whom
it was exerted; depend upon it he has something behind, that yet may
thwart you-some quibble, some quirk in the law, that he will know
full well how to handle, and throw you farther back than ever."
 </p><p>  " You do him wrong, depend upon it," said Horton, in a tone he intended to appear indifferent; but he knowing that some lawyers could in his
day, be as double faced as we know them to be in our own, he felt a
slight degree of doubt creep over him, which he would rather had not
paid him a visit at that moment.
  </p><p> The case on at their entrance being one of slight importance, and of
speedy settlement, the great cause of the day-but every cause is the great
one of the day to those engaged in it-came on. After the nature of the
case had been stated, Sergeant Thunderdown rose, and looking round,
cast upon his learned friend, Whistlepipe, one of his blandest smiles,
and then commenced, what he intended to have been a very long and
very brilliant speech.  He stated, " that the case entrusted to him
was a most peculiar case--a case differing from any case he had ever
before had placed in his hands. It was a will case-yes, a will case, but,
unlike most will cases, in this case the will was not disputed in any
case." Every time he employed the word case, he raised his voice to an
enormous pitch, and looked sneeringly at Whistlepipe, as much as to
say, " in this case I intend to shut you up, as sure as you've a head on
your shoulders."  He then went on to explain, " that Andrew Horton,
deceased, had been married; that the fruits of this marriage had been
two children, one a boy, the other a girl; that the girl was born blind;
that this child had been lost at a very tender age; that the father had
grieved almost to death at the loss of this child; that he would never be
persuaded but that one day or another she would be recovered; that it
was under these strong feelings of parental love and pity for her blindness,
that he had caused the will to be drawn up in the shape it had been.
The clause upon which the whole case turned was this-that Andrew
Horton, believing that his daughter would one day be discovered, had
left nearly the whole of his wealth away from his son for mistaken
reasons, upon which he need not then dwell, and had placed it in trust







                                       <pb id="p.335" n="335"/>

 to accumulate for the sole use and benefit of the said daughter, to be rendered up to her at any time she might be discovered: or in case of her
 not being discovered during twenty years after the death of the testator,
 then, and not till then, the property was to go to the son, Henry Horton,
 unless-now mark this word," said the sergeant, repeating it again and
 again, " unless it can be clearly proved that the lost or stolen child be
 dead.-Now the first thing we have to prove is whether the child was
 born or not."
  </p><p> " There is every reason," interrupted Whistlepipe, " according to the
natural history of the production of the human species, to believe that
the child was born, and I am led to this conclusion by the fact of the
child having been stolen, for had it not been born, it could not have been
stolen." To this argument the judge shut his eyes, and gave a formal nod
of assent. "Therefore," continued Whistlepipe, delighted at the approval
of the judge, "we admit the birth, brother Thunderdown, we admit
the birth."
  </p><p> " I am glad of that," replied the sergeant, "for it will save much of
the time of the court, for it is not always an easy matter to prove that
any man has been born. I remember a case-- "
 </p><p>  "You need not trouble yourself," said the judge, who had a horror
of Thunderdown's cases; " the point is admitted, go on."
</p><p>   " The next point we have to prove, is the discovery of the blind child
by her brother, Henry Horton, in the late Nunnery of the Minories."
</p><p>   " We admit that fact," again interrupted Whistlepipe.
 </p><p>  "I'm glad of that," replied the sergeant, "for I remember a case-'
 </p><p>  "The point is admitted," again said the judge.
 </p><p>  "Then," said the sergeant, " the two points being admitted-first,
the birth of the child, and then the discovery of the child, all I have to
prove is the death of the child--yes, the death !"  Here he stooped forward and whispered to Horton, " Now for the fun !"
 </p><p>  Horton could not help thinking, that while proving a death, it was
an odd time to choose to be funny; but he made no reply.
</p><p>  Thunderdown said--' The court, he was sure, would forgive him being
a little lengthy in his remarks, for he shrewdly suspected his learned
brother did not intend to allow him a reply; therefore all he had to say
he must say now, and if he were a little sarcastic upon one or two points,
he hoped his learned friend would take all in good part. Had his friend,
Whistlepipe, intended to produce witnesses-"
 </p><p> " And so I do," observed Whistlepipe.
 </p><p> "You do ?" ejaculated the sergeant, and then, most unprofessionally,
inquired, " and to what end ?"
 </p><p> To this question Whistlepipe made no reply; upon which Thunderdown
again lent forward, and a great deal of whispering went on between him
and Horton. "But you told me that we should have merely to walk
over the course," said the sergeant.
 </p><p> " So he led me to believe," whispered Horton; "but no witnesses can
disprove the loss of the ship, and the death of all on board."
 </p><p> Nan, too, began to feel fidgetty, and wished herself anywhere but in
a court of justice. Thunderdown, being taken off his guard, forgot all
his beautiful sarcasms, and began to think of the most cautious manner







<pb id="p.336" n="336"/>                   .

in which to carry on the case, now it had taken a different turn to what
he had been lately led to believe by Horton; but knowing it would never
do to show his annoyance, he put on a smiling face, and told his learned
brother " how delighted he should be to be introduced to any friends he
might think proper to present; and as he should, under these circumstances, have a future opportunity of again addressing the court in his
reply, he should at once call his witness to prove the death of Eoline.
He could call but one witness, for the grim monster, death, had in his
often-assumed disguise of the raging, roaring, angry waves, swallowed
up every living soul on board the ill-fated ship, excepting the witness
whose life seemed as if saved, in order that justice should be done to his
worthy client."  He then explained, "that this lady was the widow of
a distinguished officer, who had died on the glorious battle-field, and
whose station in life was such, that no doubt could possibly be raised as
to the implicit credence that should be given to all she said."
</p><p>   Dame Spikely was now brought forward for examination. The moment she stood forth, there came from the centre of the crowded court,
 one short horrid laugh. "Order!" roared out the crier. Horton started
 up, and ran to Nan  "What ails you, Nanny ?" he said, in a low voice.
 </p><p>  "Are you sure he's dead ?"
 </p><p>  "Sure !" replied Horton, and seeing Nan had somewhat resumed her
 composure, he again took his seat.
 </p><p>  Nan's eyes from the moment she had heard that laugh, never for an
 instant ceased wandering about the court, as if in search of some dreaded
 object.
</p><p>   The questions to be asked, were so clearly and carefully laid before
the examining counsel, that Nan had scarcely more to say than "yes,
or no," as the case might be; and the circumstance of the wreck being
such a well-known fact, there was no doubt at that moment on the
minds of all who heard her, nor was there on her own, but that Eoline
had perished with her husband, and the rest of those on board.
</p><p>   To Thunderdown's great astonishment, Whistlepipe never once attempted to cross-question her; therefore the case seemed clear, and
Thunderdown sat down perfectly satisfied that all was well.
   When Whistlepipe arose, he began his address by complimenting
Dame Spikely upon the clear and straightforward evidence she had
given, and that he allowed her full credit for believing every word she
had uttered-"But," said he, "how often does truth appear unlike herself,
or rather, how often does error look like truth. Now I shall be able to
prove that not one word concerning the death of the blind girl is true."
This assertion caused a great sensation, and Whistlepipe went on--" I
always go," said he, " to the fountain head at once, therefore the witness
I shall produce to prove the existence of the lady in question, will
be--   " he paused, so that what he was about to say might produce its
full effect, and then in a powerful manner, exclaimed-" the lady
herself !"
</p><p>  Upon saying this, the beautiful blind Eoline was brought forward, to
the horror of Horton, the surprise of Nan, and the admiration of all
who looked upon her. The strange sound she heard startled her, and
the lids of her beautiful eyes arose, displaying such orbs of brightness,







                                          <pb id="p.337" n="337"/>

that every one seemed to doubt the possibility of her blindness. That
she was the person saved from the wreck, was soon made manifest by
the evidence of the merchant and his brave companions.
 </p><p>  There was but one chance now left for Horton, and that at the first
glance appeared a strong one; namely, that of obliging the adverse
party to prove that Eoline was really the lost child of Andrew Horton;
that had not yet been proved, and it seemed rather that that should
have been the first point to be attended to by the defendant's counsel;
for, as it was argued by Thunderdown, who now insisted upon quoting
various cases he well remembered, in which it was laid down, and
clearly laid down too, that-" mere assertion was no proof."
 </p><p>  The learned judge at first thought he should like to reserve that point
for further consideration; but presently, having turned over various
books, and then having argued the question well in his own mind,
came to the conclusion that the opinion of former judges need not be reversed, for he felt with them, that mere assertion was not proof; it then
did certainly lie with the defendant to prove, that the claimant he
brought forward in the person of a certain blind girl named Eoline, was
herself, and no other, the child of the deceased Andrew Horton.
 </p><p> This appeared a most difficult point to get over, so Horton and
the sergeant imagined; and with that difficulty their courage again
arose.
 </p><p> Whistlepipe confessed he was placed in a position of some awkwardness, and begged for a few moments to consult with his client.
 </p><p> The judge, who with the jury were beginning to feel a little hungry,
consented to allow ten minutes, and that the jury might retire and
take a slight refreshment.
 </p><p> " You see," said Whistlepipe to his client, and to the merchant, and
indeed to all who were interested on his side, " you see, the fact of the girl
being herself was so perfectly, though tacitly admitted to be herself, that
had not that deep scoundrel, Thunderdown, who, I must confess, is
never at a loss, had he not raised this objection, all would have been
well; but what to do is now a difficult question."
 </p><p> The only evidence they could bring forward was the Cripple. It
is true that the Abbess had lately informed him of the secret of
Eoline's birth, but she had never explained how she became acquainted
with the fact; and even if she had, his evidence would have been regarded with a very jealous eye, he being so deeply interested in the
success of Eoline, she being his wife. Slender as the hope was, it was
all they had now to rely on, and so it was determined that the Cripple
should be examined as to all the late Abbess had ever revealed to him
upon that subject.
 </p><p> When the judge returned, he came in evidently in good humour with
whatever he had been taking, and soundly smacked his lips, and the
clerks smacked their lips, and the jury smacked their lips, and there was
a wonderful twisting about of mouths, as is generally the case with
most people for some minutes after eating. Silence being called, the
case proceeded.
</p><p>  Whistlepipe said-" That although he had been taken by surprise, he








<pb id="p.338" n="338"/>                   .

still felt confident he should produce good proof of the identity of the
claimant."
 </p><p> The Cripple was then examined, but all he could say was that a short
time before they had sailed from abroad in the fated ship which had
been wrecked, and in which the Abbess had perished, she had told him
that Eoline was really the daughter of Andrew Horton; that this revelation had been led to in consequence of the discovery of some
documents, amongst which was a will like the one that had been produced, and it was to lay claim to the property bequeathed in that will,
that they had taken this voyage to England.
</p><p>  When he had concluded, Whistlepipe made the most of every word;
but the judge interrupting him, and shaking his head, said-" I am
afraid, brother Whistlepipe, if this be all the evidence you can produce,
you must give in; in such a case as the present, the proof of identity
should be most powerful; and here, we do not even know-supposing
the last witness to have spoken the truth--we do not even know how
the Abbess was aware that Eoline was the child of Horton. It is unfortunate in your case that the Abbess could not be produced; but as
the affair stands-- " and again he shook his head.
 </p><p> While the judge and Whistlepipe were arguing the point, Horton and
the sergeant were beginning to collect their papers, regarding the cause
really at an end.
  </p><p>Just at this moment the Bridge-shooter put his head in at the side
door, and having caught the eye of the merchant beckoned him out.
</p><p>  In a few minutes the merchant returned, and whispered a few words
to their counsel.
 </p><p> Sergeant Thunderdown being impatient to let off his sarcasms in a
volley and go home, asked his learned friend-" If that was his case ?"
</p><p>  Whistlepipe replied--" Not quite; I have one witness more to examine. Call in Elizabeth Savage, late Abbess of the Poor Clares."
 </p><p> The astonishment and despair of Horton can easily be imagined;
the feelings of Nan were scarcely less harrowing.
 </p><p> In a few minutes and again the door opened, and the Abbess, who
appeared half dead from illness, brought on by her sufferings during
and after the storm, was carried in, seated in a chair. She was allowed
to retain her seat, indeed, it was evident to all that it would be impossible
for her to stand. The disclosures she now made astonished all, but none
more so than Horton himself; for upon being asked her name, she
answered-" I was called Elizabeth Savage; but that is not my name.
Must I confess my real one ?-but it is better that I should at once-it
will make all clearer-simpler. I am Eoline Horton, and that blind
girl is my own child."
 </p><p> A strange scene here took place, for Eoline hearing the well-known
voice, sounding as though it had risen from the grave to claim her for
her child, forced her way to the spot whence these happy sounds had
sprung, and falling on her knees, clung to her mother in an almost agony
of rapture.
 </p><p> Every word the Abbess now uttered, created a deepening interest.
She explained how the shattered oat in which she lay, as in death,
had been cast upon the shore: that by the care of those who found her,








                                            <pb id="p.339" n="339"/>

 her life had been preserved; that believing herself upon the bed of death,
 she had prepared a full account of all she was then relating, and that it
 was to deliver up this document she had sent for the merchant; but in consequence of the foreign sailor having lost her letter, all were kept
 ignorant of whom had sent it, until the Bridge-shooter had reached her
 place of refuge.
  </p><p> It was soon found that her strength would never hold out to the end,
 so it was arranged that her written narrative should be read aloud,
 and that then she could, as it proceeded, make any observation she
 might think fit; it ran thus:-
                  <title>" THE CONFESSION OF A SINNER."</title>
  </p><p> " In very early life I was married, by compulsion, to a man I never
 loved; but he was rich, and riches, in my father's eyes, were parent to
 all virtues. The man I married was Andrew Horton, a cold-hearted,
 violent, unfeeling monster, who cared not whom he sacrificed, so that
 his own desires were accomplished. Wretched indeed was soon my
 fate. Ere long, I found that his pretended affection for me, was but one
 of his thousand fancies; I had been coveted by others, therefore I was
 coveted by him. Weeks and months rolled on; every succeeding one
 more wretched than the last. I now became a mother; my infant, a boy,
 was, almost as soon as born, removed from me, and placed under the
 care of one of his other victims; she was a poor weak girl, whose bright
 blue eyes had caught his fancy; she was placed as a nurse to my child,
 and with her sister, dwelt beneath the same roof with his insulted, neglected wife. The next year of my life was one of unceasing tears;
 to such an excess did the heart's pure springs o'erflow, that for weeks
 I have frequently been totally blind from weeping; it was in this
 miserable state I bore a daughter; the temporary blindness of the parent
 fixed itself for ever upon the child-she was born sightless. My existence became a torture to me; all I prayed for was to die. At last
 driven to madness by insult and oppression, I fled my husband's home
 for ever. There was little need of great precaution to keep hidden my
 place of refuge, for well I knew he would make but little effort to recover
 me; he was tired of me, and therefore was thankful for any chance that
 should rid him of "his curse," as he always called me. I entered the
 abode of the poor Clares; circumstances combined to make me soon the
 head of that house. One night I pretended to have found a poor blind
 orphan, but it was false, for the girl I brought was my own child; this
 pretended orphan was my double comfort, for I soon learnt that the only
 chord of my husband's heart that could be touched, I had torn to threads,
 by taking away his child; this was indeed a solace, but a wicked one;
the other comfort was a mother's love being rewarded by a darling
child's affection."
  </p><p>The narrative then went on to describe those scenes which the reader
has already been made acquainted with; such as the visit of Horton as
a commissioner of Cromwell, and how she had checked his licentious
coure by whispering in his ear that Eoline was his sister, although it
was long before known to her that Horton was no child of hers; for, as
Nan had truly stated to him, his real mother had taken refuge in the







<pb id="p.340" n="340"/>
Convent of the Minories, and, it now appeared, had, on her death-bed
revealed the truth of the changing of the children. But here followed a
passage in the Abbess's narrative which truly astonished those who heard
it, for it stated that the rich old man, who had taken a liking to, and
had, in fact, bought the true offspring of Andrew Horton, and had
with it gone to Italy, passing the boy off as his own son and heir, was
a baronet named Filbut Fussey, at whose death, the boy, now grown
to man's estate, unconscious of doing wrong, and unopposed by any of
the relations of his supposed father, laid claim to, and enjoyed all the
old man's vast possessions. Thus it appeared that Eoline and the murdered knight were, in truth, brother and sister, and that Harry Horton
in no way could lay claim to inherit any portion of the wealth left by
Andrew Horton. So well had the Abbess digested her plans to secure to
her daughter her rights, that in one part, where confirmation was required of assertions that might appear doubtful without a witness, forth
stepped the once-saintly father Brassinjaw, who, as former confessor of the
poor Clares, disclosed as much (and perhaps a little more), as his priestly
oath of secrecy would permit; but in the case of the death-bed confession of Nan's sister, what she had then revealed, was not for the purpose of obtaining absolution, but that those who heard it might one day
bear witness to the truth.
</p><p>  The moment Brassinjaw had been informed that his evidence was to
ruin Horton, he flew to the task with all the appetite with which we
might imagine a hawk would pounce upon a poor defenceless sparrow.
It must be owned that Brassinjaw cut but a rather unbecoming figure,
for having a wish to give as much weight as he could to his evidence, by
putting on a solemn and devout appearance, he had shaved off as much
of his beard and his whiskers as his vanity would permit, and wore, as
it were, a pied-bald suit of clothes-half saint, half sinner; the very
few remains of his former priestly gear he had donned for the occasion,
not remembering, at the moment, how ill they agreed with the
attributes of a publican. But he performed his part so well, that there
could be no doubt concerning the truth of every portion of the Abbess's
narrative.
 </p><p> So absorbed had Nan now been in painful reflections, caused by the unexpected public disclosures that were sounding in her ears, that she was
quite unconscious of Harry Horton having, unnoticed by any one, left the
court; she felt sick at heart, and turning to speak to Horton as she
thought, she found a stranger by her-one glance-then uttering a piercing
shriek, flew from the court as in a fit of frightful madness. In the confusion that ensued, the cause of her alarm also made his retreat, but not
before the Bridge-shooter had noticed him sufficiently to make him feel
convinced, that that man, and the mysterious stranger who left the
dagger, were the same.
 </p><p> Thunderdown, feeling how completely he had been crushed, put on
his usual show of virtuous indignation, and dashing down his brief, complained bitterly of the manner in which he had been deceived by his
client; and then closely folding his arms, as if wrapping himself up in
his own integrity, he too left the court.
 </p><p> A very short time sufficed to conclude the rest of the affair; aid with








                                           <pb id="p.341" n="341"/>

 comparatively light hearts, the Cripple with his now rich wife,
 accompanied by their friends, quitted the justice court-we say,
 with comparatively light hearts, for the uncertain fate of the merchant's
 daughter could not but cast a damp upon their otherwise boundless joy.
  </p><p> Osborne, whose attendance had not been required, was during the
 trial prosecuting his enquiries in every quarter the most likely, and even
 the most unlikely, to gain information regarding the lost Anne: he
 even consulted the Bridge-shooter's mother, who, this time, honestly
 confessed herself at fault; but, as she said, no wonder that her eyes, regarding futurity, should have become dim, since now she could only look
 through a veil of tears, shed for her departed spirit: by this she meant,
 that her old black cat was dead, and she now began to persuade herself
 that with her "spirit," her own supernatural powers had ceased to exist.
 </p><p>  It was after this visit to the witch of Houndsditch, that Edward had
gone to the Earl's mansion. He was ushered into a magnificent gallery,
hung round with portraits of the Earls of Shrewsbury, and pictures of
many of the great actions of their lives. He had been waiting some
time, when, hearing a door open at the opposite end of the gallery to
that by which he had entered, and by which the attendant had gone
out, he turned suddenly, and felt perfectly bewildered, for there, before
him, stood Walter Lerue, splendidly attired. Lerue appeared to Osborne
to start back at seeing him, and then became almost as much confused
as he himself was. The fact was Lord George had not yet been apprized
of Osborne's visit, so that meeting him unexpectedly in his father's
mansion, it had startled him, he scarcely knew wherefore, unless indeed
that his masquerading must now be confessed, and that in such confession he felt his dignity would, in a degree, suffer humiliation.
 </p><p>  After a moment's hesitation, caused by feeling a jealousy rising in
his heart at being thus near a rival, Osborne said-" I but little expected to meet with Master Lerue in this mansion-nor-indeed-that is-
I was told to await here the coming of the Earl, or of his son-and---"
 </p><p>  " And you are welcome, Master Edward Osborne," said Lord Talbot,
having recovered from his surprise, and as he advanced, he held forth his
hand to Osborne, which the later took, but with evident reluctance.
</p><p>" If your heart were as bad as your memory," said his lordship, "you
would be a much worse man than you ever will be. Look at me again;
we are old friends, are we not ?"
 </p><p> " Once meeting for an hour at the Cottage on the Heath," replied
Edward, "is scarcely intercourse sufficient to form an acquaintanceship, much less cement a friendship."
 </p><p> " Tut, man," said the other; " why, you cannot surely forget when we
were boys, we went bathing together, and i'faith, but for your timely aid,
I had once taken a bath too much off Battersea." Hearing these words,
Osborne for the first time looked really at the features of the speaker.
</p><p>" Be not surprised, in finding in Master Lerue the heir of Shrewsbury.
My memory, Master Osborne, is far better than your own; but no
wonder in this case, for noble minds easily forget the favours they have
bestowed, but honest ones never forget the favours they have received.
I remember too that you have a ring of mine, and have no doubt come
to claim the promise made, when that ring was given.  What favour








<pb id="p.342" n="342"/>                   .

would you ask ? 'tis granted ere it be spoken; but do not think it will be
gratuitously bestowed. No, no, indeed!" and his lordship's hitherto
pale and melancholy features, for a moment were lighted by a smile.
</p><p>"I shall in return demand a favour of Master Osborne, and one that
will in my mind far outweigh any obligation Lord Talbot can ever grant.
But first to discharge my debt to my preserver, if indeed he has brought
in his heavy account against me, and having done that, or paid an instalment, we will then speak of our departed acquaintance, Walter
Lerue. Speak, what can I do to serve you ?"
</p><p>  Edward was so completely thrown off his balance, as one might say,
by this unexpected discovery, that he could scarcely stand upright.
</p><p>  Lord George perceiving this, pushed forward a magnificent seat, and
drawing another near to it, said-" As I hope this visit will not be a
short one, let us be seated, for though you may have but little to say,
I have much, and that, too, of some moment: be seated and speak freely-
you have a willing listener.
</p><p>  Edward now   began to tell his tale by saying-" You, my lord,
having already been somewhat acquainted with the inmates of the
Cottage on the Heath, will doubtless be surprised to learn that he who
owned that Cottage, was not Master Allen, an humble trader as he
there appeared, but-"
 </p><p> " Master William  Hewet, the king's great merchant," interrupted
Lord Talbot.  " You see I know more than you suspected, do I not ?"
 </p><p> "Heaven grant that you may know how to discover the treasure
Master Hewet has, I fear, for ever lost!"
</p><p>  " What treasure has that worthy merchant lost ?" enquired the
other.
 </p><p> "His child!" said Osborne, and he felt ready to choke as he spoke
the words.
 </p><p> "His child !" exclaimed the young lord, lost his child, that loveliest of all created beings ? Speak, speak, surely I must misunderstand
your words."
 </p><p> " Alas !" replied Edward, " they are too plain, too true, to admit of
but one meaning."  Edward then recounted the whole of the incidents
connected with the attack of the robbers; and that after Anne had left
the cottage, in the endeavour to reach the farm unobserved, she had
never again been seen. " When you bestowed upon me this ring, you
told me, that whenever I required aid, I was to claim it here."
 </p><p> " Whatever aid, I, or my house, can bring, will be brought right willingly, for I have other reasons for feeling anxious on that fair maid's
account, then you at present guess at. But how can we hope to solve
the mystery ?"
 </p><p> "There is a slight chance of obtaining a clue, by the aid of thi
badge-it is the badge of your noble house."  Saying this, he produced
the badge, and then explained the circumstances under which it had
been found.
 </p><p> " There is more knavery in this," said Lord Talbot, " than we shall
perhaps ever fathom; but I think I have a knave that will ferret it out-
at least as much as mortal depth can fathom or ferret out; he is my







                                         <pb id="p.343" n="343"/>

varlet-by name Nino, an Italian rogue, who, because he did me a service when in Italy, has ever since stuck to me as a blood-sucker."
 </p><p> The young lord went to a side door, within which, at a couple of feet
distance, was another door; he opened this also, and then calling the
Italian by his name, Nine appeared.
 </p><p> Nino now put on a very different bearing to that which he assumed
when with his equals or inferiors in station; he carried himself so humbly, and threw such an expression of simplicity into his countenance,
that few, but those who knew him as thoroughly as his lord did, would
have suspected him of being the rogue he really was.
 </p><p> Lord Talbot, holding the badge up suddenly before Nino's eyes, exclaimed-" Whose badge is that ?"
 </p><p> Whose, my lord ?"
 </p><p> " Yes, whose ? There needs no thinking-answer !"
 </p><p> The young lord asked the question thus suddenly, hoping, that did
Nino know aught concerning it, he would be taken off his guard, and
thus betray himself; but in this he was wrong, for Nino at once answered-" Why, yours, my lord !"
  </p><p>"  know 'tis mine," replied the other; " but would know who wore
it last and lost it ? Had my orders been obeyed, and the badges numbered, we should have known at once whose it was."
</p><p>  " I know," said Nino; " it is doubtless the badge of Phillip of the
Buttery: he absconded a fortnight since with Mona, our lady's woman;
fearful of discovery, he has torn the badge from his arm, and cast it
away."
</p><p>  "It may have been as he says," observed Lord Talbot, addressing
Osborne. " You may be gone."
</p><p>  Nino bowed humbly, and retired through the door he had entered by.
 </p><p> " I fear me we shall trace but little by this badge; but this I promise, that not an engine of power, that is likely to avail us, but
shall immediately be set in motion. And now to the favour I would
ask of you; but, for the present, you must pledge me your word not to
breath it to mortal ear."  Having said this, he rose, and cautiously approaching the door through which Nino had passed, flung it suddenly
open, when there stood, in the space between the two doors, the Italian
Nino.
 </p><p> Had Lord Talbot been armed, so great was his rage, that the Italian's
life would, in all probability, have paid the forfeit for his evesdropping;
as it was, the young lord seized him by the throat, then cast him
backwards with such violence, against the inner doors, that they gave
way, and Nino fell violently upon the floor of the outer room.
</p><p>  " Scoundrel!" exclaimed Lord Talbot, " I have often suspected this,
but never could catch you till now. Be gone! never dare to step foot
again within these walls !" He paced up and down two or three times,
and then resuming his seat, said-" Forgive me, Master Osborne, for
being thus ruffled by such a hind as that; but I shall smile at my own
passion presently, and will then proceed with what I would have you
know. No doubt, but indeed I am sure, you must have been surprised
to find, that the poor artist of the Heath, and the boy you saved, were
one, and that one-Lord Talbot! 'Tis right that I explain to you how







<pb id="p.344" n="344"/>                     .
all this came to pass; for, believe me, no unworthy motive caused me
to assume another name, however unhappily terminated some circumstances to which that change has led."
 </p><p>  Osborne, who was yet unacquainted with the real cause of poor Lillia's
death, could not comprehend to what his noble friend alluded; but soon
he was doomed to hear that which he could comprehend, alas! too well.
 </p><p>  The young lord proceeded-" It was a difference I had had with my
father, that made me, for a time, wish to live in retirement-indeed, from
him, in concealment.  I assumed the character of an artist, being a great
lover of the art, though but a poor executant, put up at the Ferry, and
strolled about the country with my gun and my drawings, and killed
time as well as I could. In one of my rambles, I saw the ' Beauty of
the Heath,' for so sweet Mistress Anne was called all the country
round; I was enraptured. But who could look upon her, and not be
so ?"
 </p><p>  Poor Osborne could not help thinking the speaker was quite right.
But what could he have been about all this number of years, that he had
been blessed by seeing her, speaking to her, serving her, and yet never
to discover her excellencies, until another pointed them out to him.
 </p><p>  "You, doubtless, know that fate at last placed an opportunity in my
way, of being of some slight service to her: I seized that opportunity of
becoming more intimate, and every moment I was near her, I discovered,
not only in her features, but in her mind, new beauties. I knew the
folly of giving way to feelings that, in spite of all my efforts to prevent
them, would keep rising in my heart; I took myself to task severely;
but the more I strove to convince myself of my weakness, for our stations
being so widely different, that of an earl's son and a poor trader's
daughter, that an honourable love seemed madness; and who could dare
to love that sweet girl but honourably?  You look astonished that I
should be thus frank and open to you; but all I now say, is said to
lead to the favour I intend to demand at your hands."
</p><p>  Poor Edward sat and listened, wondered, and inwardly groaned, for it
was evident that the young lord had, at least, cast a longing eye upon
his heart's adored. What was to be the end of this long introduction,
he was quite at a loss to imagine.
  </p><p>" The unexpected meeting with the merchant on the evening you
saw me at the cottage, and whom  I instantly recognised as Master
Hewet-but he knew not me: not so that quick-eyed jade, Flora
-she was not deceived for one moment-I assumed all the appearance of indifference I could command; but I inwardly felt, that that
night must break the spell that I had too long allowed to surround me;
I left the cottage, never to return to it-exerted all my reason to combat
the violent passion, which had so nearly conquered me; but now I had
determined never more to think of the ' Beauty of the Heath,' the more
would her image rise, like the fairy form of a dream, and engross my
every thought."
</p><p>  Osborne, as he listened, almost fancied he was hearing his own story
related, so exactly did the feelings, painted by the young lord, coincide
with his own. But again he asked himself-" How is this strange tale
to end ?"  He was not long left in doubt, for the other continued.







                                          <pb id="p.345" n="345"/>

 </p><p> " I wandered about-flew from place to place: my friends became
anxious, for none could guess the cause of my altered state of mind. I
have ever noticed, that the strongest attachments invariably take root
where such feelings should never know existence. I could command
the wealthiest, the proudest, the most exalted beauties of the land; but
they are not the simple ' Beauty of the Heath ;' the remembrance of
her brightness throws all others in the shade: into such a pitch of phrenzy
has this short absence cast me, that I now feel that life with her, or
death without her, must be my fate: I have, therefore, determined to
demand her hand !"
 </p><p> So astonished was poor Osborne at hearing these last words, that he
actually fell back on his seat, and stared his eyes nearly out of his head
at the young lord, without uttering a single word.
  </p><p>" I see you are astonished," said Lord Talbot, " and I wonder not
that you should be; but when you remember all her charms of mind,
of form, of face, your wonder soon will cease. The world will stare,
and gape, I know. But what is the world to him, who must quit that
world, unless the life which can alone make that world endurable, is
sustained by the love of her, in whose love alone he will consent to live.
Now, the favour I would ask of you, is this; but, alas! I had forgotten
she is lost-lost, perhaps, to us all for ever-"
</p><p>  Osborne was too much bewildered by his own miserable thoughts to
reply. The confession he had just heard, and the expressed determination of the heir of Shrewsbury, to demand the hand of Anne, if she
should be found, seemed a death-blow to his very existence.-" Now
then," he said, within himself, " now then, this land and I are
strangers indeed. The moment Anne be restored, if ever she should be,
that moment shall see me set my foot upon a bark, to bear me away for
ever."
</p><p>  The young lord paced up and down in violent agitation, and then exclaimed, as if speaking to himself-" Not a nook, not a dwelling, of high
or low, but shall be searched, and searched thoroughly too, but we will
find her, or those who have wronged her; I have power, and that power
shall be used to find out the truth of this mystery. You now know,"
he said, addressing Osborne, " the secret feelings of my mind; keep them,
at present, locked in your own breast; but the moment sweet Anne
shall be restored, it is upon you I depend; you must plead my cause-
you must discover for me the inward feelings of her heart, for I cannot
stoop to ask and be rejected.  In the meantime, be sure that every
nerve of mine will be exerted to discover the retreat, or fate of sweet
Anne Hewet.   I will so arrange, that you shall always find me at a
moment's notice."
 </p><p> Osborne, considering the extraordinary turn matters had taken, to
that which he had believed his visit would lead to, managed to leave the
young lord's presence with tolerable composure; but the moment he
found himself alone, in the grounds that led to the boat in which he was
to return, he hurried into a concealed alcove, and gave full vent to his
sorrow.-" Now," he exclaimed, " now indeed may I write upon my
heart, ' hope dwells not here !"
 </p><p> We will not attempt to depict all his agony.  If any thing could have






<pb id="p.346" n="346"/>                  .

blighted the little hope he formerly might have pictured to himself-and
who, in this world, but will, at times, picture hope to their sinking
hearts ?-that last ray of hope was dimmed, extinguished, by the knowledge of one so great as the young lord he had just left, having determined to offer his wealth and name to the merchant's daughter.
 </p><p>  " But I will never see that day-no, no, I will never see that day.
Religion forbids us to take the life which Heaven has bestowed upon
us; but religion does not forbid our flying from the cause of all our
woes."
  </p><p> While so many were employed in various districts, endeavouring to
discover the lost Anne, she was a prisoner within an arm's length of
those who dwelt in the house of her birth upon the Bridge. When she
had been brought to the Cardinal's Hat, she was at once conveyed to
the upper room of the house; for this room being lighted by a skylight only,
it would be impossible for any one confined there to discover, from
outward views, where their prison lay. After the powerful draught
she had swallowed began to lose its narcotic virtue, returning sense began to assert its sway. The first time she opened her eyes with real
consciousness-for all she had before beheld, whenever her sleepful eyelids rose, was so dreamy in effect, that it could scarcely be said she saw,
or knew aught of what she looked upon around her-but, as we have
just observed, the first time real consciousness held power o'er her vision,
her eyes met those of Mona, who had been incessantly watching over
her from the night on which she had been brought there. Anne started
from her couch and screamed.
  </p><p>" What are you afraid of, child ?" said Mona.
 </p><p> " Afraid of!" ejaculated Anne; "but who are you? and how came I
in this wretched place ?" She then shut her eyes again for a moment:
then, opening them, looked around doubtingly, as though she half fancied
she still was in a dream-" Do not look so strangely at me; but speak,
speak ! where am I ?"
 </p><p> " Were I to tell you, perhaps those who brought you here," said Mona,
"might think my tongue an inch too long, and cut it off."
</p><p>  " Oh, heavens !" exclaimed Anne, placing both her hands upon her
forehead, " what a frightful thought flies through my brain. I remember now the dreadful struggle on the Heath. Oh, tell me, tell me ! am
I indeed within the power of those wretches ?"
 </p><p>" Hush !" whispered Mona. " A villain never likes to hear himself
called a villain-speak lower. I have been watching, anxiously watching for your returning sense; for in your delirium you have uttered
words and names that make me believe the truth has not been told me:
speak lowly, but truly, and you may perhaps have found a friend in one,
who to herself has never been a friend-You love !"
 </p><p>Anne blushed, and looking enquiringly into the face of the Italian
girl, answered--" I do ! but you and myself are the only two who know
it."
 </p><p> "And the name of him you love is -"
  Anne again blushed as she almost whispered-" Edward; but why
do you ask ?"
  </p><p>" Because I fancy I am to be deceived, and made a fool of," replied








                                         <pb id="p.347" n="347"/>

Mona, frowning as few but an Italian can frown; " that was the name
you muttered so frequently when your mind was wandering, and made
me doubt their tale. They told me his name was George, and that he
was a noble of this land."
  </p><p>" George !" said Anne, " I know no human being bearing that name;
and never, to my knowledge, spoke a word to mortals above my own
humble state."
  </p><p>" Then it is a lie !" exclaimed Mona, starting up, " but a lie that shall
stick in his throat until it choak him. I have been too bitterly deceived
by him, to be deceived by him again. One way or other, I am to be
fooled, and you made their victim !"
 </p><p> " Oh, heavens!" exclaimed the affrighted girl, springing from the
couch on which she had been lying, and casting herself upon her knees
before the still-frowning Mona. " Oh, save me, save me ! I know not
where I am-I know not where to look for safety but in you: then, save
me, save me!"
  </p><p> The room in which this scene was enacting, was an oddly-shaped
apartment at the top of Brassinjaw's dwelling. There was but little
furniture in the place; but what there was, was of massive structure.
The place was at all times in parts, quite dark; the only light coming
through a small skylight in the roof. Beneath this skylight, a sort of
gallery passed across, forming a communication between two lofts.
  </p><p> Just as Anne had thrown herself upon her knees, and seized the hand
of the Italian girl, a huge ill-looking head might have been seen obtruding from one of the doors at one end of the shattered gallery. It was
Brassinjaw, who, like Mona, began to suspect that he was being made
a dupe of, and who determined to learn the truth for himself, as far as he
could, by listening to all the Italian and the trader's daughter they had
stolen away, might say to each other, and, by this means, learn how
best to act, for his own advantage.
 </p><p>  So eloquently did Anne plead her own cause-so feelingly did she
picture the suffering she too well knew her poor mother was then enduring-the agony of her broken-hearted father-the mention of the
father's woe, appeared to touch a chord in Mona's breast, whose vibrations
thrilled through every fibre of her softened heart, and called up visions
of days gone by-visions that memory's eye could never look on but in
tears, that she raised the imploring girl-then buried her own face upon
the shoulder of Anne, as through a flood of grief she exclaimed-" I
know, I know! oh, it was of a broken heart my father died; and I it
was who broke it !"
  </p><p> It now became Anne's turn to offer consolation; but this she found a
 more difficult matter than might have been expected, for Mona kept exclaiming-" 'Tis useless, useless! remorse can never know relief. Oh,
 remorse! remorse! thou art the bitterest drug that ever poisons the
 human heart! No, remorse can never know relief!"
  </p><p> All this time Brassinjaw continued to be all ears. He strained every
 nerve not to lose a word; but presently he made a discovery that somewhat alarmed him.
 </p><p>  Mona having partially recovered, said-" I have not been thus moved
 for many a day; the voice of remorse can only be drowned by wild excitement;

<pb id="p.348" n="348"/>
 to this I have, for some time past, given way, and for that
time I fancied I had forgotten; but being alone watching your slumbers
for so long, I had time to think, and all the ghosts of former days rose
up before me; all that you said in your delirious dreams, brought back
to recollection, that I too had once a home-a happy sunny home; I
too had once been blessed by a doting parent; I too had loved, but therein
lay my curse ! So blindly mad with love was I for Nino (that was my
lover's name) that all warnings proved of no avail; at last I fled with
him, to follow him to this distant land; but I would have followed him
into the fiery gulph, while I believed he loved me: he made of me
whatsoe'er he would, even to become a thief: it was this last vile act
that tore from my eyes the blinding scales, and I now see myself, and all
the vile acts I have done, in their full deformity. Although I am now
convinced he no longer loves me, the recollection of our early days of
affection still clings around my heart, and for a moment seems to bind
me to him; but that slight bond I have vowed to break. It is my fixed
resolve to return to my native country, though I should beg my bread
at each step I go. I will sin no more. All I pray for now is to be
suffered by heaven to crawl to my father's grave and die. But you
must first be saved; your salvation shall prove a slight atonement for
one who has done wrong, not loving wrong, but through loving wrongly."
 </p><p> "Oh, bless you, bless you!" exclaimed Anne, throwing her arms
round the neck of the Italian girl, "oh, bless you! and know, that if
you but save me from the peril I feel I am now encompassed by, no
lack of means will have to be endured throughout your journey to your
native land, though that journey should extend to thrice the distance
round the globe."
 </p><p> "Then are you not the daughter of a poor trader of the name of
Allen ?" enquired Mona.
 </p><p> "Allen is a name by which I have for some few years been known,"
replied Anne, " but Allen is not my real one." Here Brassinjaw strained
his neck over the railing of the gallery. " No, so far from being the
child of a poor trader, I am the only daughter of one of the richest merchants of this great city-William Hewet, merchant to the king." A
little dash of pride animated Anne's countenance as she announced her
high respectability, for which, in the next moment, she blushed. " You
talk of saving me," she continued, " but how ? you are I fear almost as
much a prisoner as I; but if you could reach his house, alas ! I fear far,
far away from here, his house on Old London Bridge-"
 </p><p> "Where ?" interrupted Mona, " where did you say ?"
 </p><p> "On Old London Bridge," replied Anne; "reach but that, and you
will easily find it, for his house is well known there; it stands next to
a wine-shop called the Cardinal's Hat."
 </p><p> "Hush," whispered the Italian girl, " we are speaking too loudly--
be calm, for what I am about to tell you, might, without warning,
prove too much for you to hear. Your father's house is there." And
Mona pointed with her thumb over her shoulder towards the wall.
 </p><p> " There ! what mean you ?" exclaimed Anne, feeling there was something in the word she could not comprehend.
  </p><p>"There," repeated Mona, again pointing with her thumb, "there,








                                          <pb id="p.349" n="349"/>

within a foot of you, is the scene of your birth; this is the wine-house
you have named."
 </p><p> Anne was about to utter an exclamation of joy and surprise, but was
checked by Mona. " That they have brought you here, is a proof they
know you not: be silent, for in silence is your only hope; did they but
once suspect who, and what you really are, their idea of safety would
be in your destruction."
 </p><p> "Good heavens !" exclaimed Anne, in a voice subdued by alarm and
deepened by fear; " and am I truly so near all that is dear to me-
all that would shield me, yet dare I not fly to that love-to that
protection ?"
 </p><p> " Dissimulation is your only hope; I must appear to know nothing,
and when I find the opportunity, I will nence-disclose to your friends
your peril, then look to them and Heaven for my own safety."
 </p><p> " A swifter plan for our release," said Anne, still almost whispering,
"I think I can devise. If this be the house you say it is, there is outside
that door-for from that skylight, I imagine this to be the highest room--
a staircase leading to yon gallery, which thence leads to the roof; you
look astonished at my knowledge of this locality, but by that very stair,
some years now gone, I verily believe I did descend to seek for safety,
as I now shall mount it in the self-same hope."
 </p><p> "Such a stair does exist," said Mona, "and I comprehend your
meaning: not a moment must be lost; we must find safety now or
never."
</p><p>  Clinging together, the Italian girl and Anne hastened towards the
door-they opened it, when, horror! there stood Spikely, Brassinjaw,
and the Italian Nino.
 </p><p> "So so, my mistress," said Nino, addressing Mona, "you would
betray your lover, would you ?-fly from him-eh ?-But you are easily
dealt with." Saying which, he suddenly cast a rope with a slip-knot on
it, over her neck; then drawing it tight, the poor Italian girl fell to
the ground, struggling in strangulation; in another minute, and she
was bound hand and foot; the cord was removed from her neck, and the
three wretches left the apartment, carrying their victim between them.
 </p><p> Anne was so stupified by this sudden scene, that she stood transfixed,
until the secure bolting of the door aroused her. What she had just seen,
clearly proved to her the kind of wretches she was detained by. Her
agony redoubled at the thought of the fate her newly-found friend would
meet with from the hands of such monsters. The mere glance she had
obtained of Spikely and of Nino, showed her that they were the same
with whom she had so fiercely struggled on the Heath. Her only
hope lay in instant flight; but how  to accomplish it?   If she
could reach the gallery, might she not thus find an outlet still unbarred ?
-the trial must be made. The moment the idea entered her mind,
she was at her labours. Every thing that she could pile the one upon
the other, was brought and placed beneath the gallery. Her feeling
now was almost as great for the safety of the Italian girl as for her
own. The massive table was dragged to the proper spot: on this she
placed the heavy stool, or chair; and then, with other smaller things,
she built up a mount, from which she could reach the gallery. How







<pb id="p.350" n="350"/>

cautiously did she attempt the ascent, yet how determined was everyI
movement! She felt that life or death was in every step. She reached
the summit-caught firmly hold of the railing; it suddenly gave way,
and she fell backwards to the ground, stunned-insensible.
  </p><p> When the three worthies, Spikely, Brassinjaw, and Nino, had placed
 Mona, still bound, in a place they believed one of safety-namely, a
 closet near the lower room-they began to discuss their proposed modes
 of action. Their discovery, through Brassinjaw, that the Beauty of the
 Heath was really the daughter of Hewet, so closely their host's neighbour, disconcerted their plans greatly. Nino, too, found that he had
 miscalculated his lord's ideas of honour, and that from his first, as he
 had thought well-laid clever plan, nothing but further disgrace and
 punishment were likely to accrue, if carried into full effect, now was devising some scheme how he could virtuously turn his knowledge to account. Then, again, what were they to do with Mona ? She had now
 declared her intention of leaving Nino; and after what had just occurred,
 should they set her at liberty, there was little knowing what course she
 might pursue. Brassinjaw observed-" I say nothing-mind, I say
 nothing ! but were she my stumblingblock, I know how I should dispose
 of her." As he rose, he began unconcernedly to hum the air of " London Bridge is broken down ;" then placing an old shattered chair on a
 particular spot, left the room.
 </p><p>  " What does he mean by that ?" enquired Nino.
   </p><p>" How should I know !" replied Spikely. " But this I do know, that
never did the saintly Father Brassinjaw do aught without an end in
view-in that old chair, depend upon it, there is a meaning."
 </p><p>  The words were scarcely out of his mouth, before the floor, whereon
the chair stood, gave way-the chair was gone; and Nino, starting up,
ran to the opening in the floor, but as quickly started back again, for all
he saw beneath, was the raging waters dashing through the arch beneath
the Bridge.
 </p><p>  Nino, turning towards Spikely, cast on him an enquiring look, as asking
a solution of this strange proceeding; but Spikely merely received it with
a vacant stare, and taking from his pouch a sort of memorandum-book,
began to read.
 </p><p>  When Nino looked again towards the spot where the opening had so
recently been, he found the floor had already resumed its original state.
At the same moment one of the panels, close to him, slid aside, and
there stood Brassinjaw, grinning, in evident delight, at having astonished
the Italian.
 </p><p> " What means all this ?" said Nino, as Brassinjaw closed the panel
through which he had entered.
 </p><p> " Oh, nothing, nothing !" replied the other, " a mere nothing! It is
a simple way I have adopted for getting rid of any odd thing I have no
further use for-that is all."
 </p><p> " Then, I suppose," said Nino, " as I wished to get rid of Mona,
you would prescribe that cold bath. But, no, no ! although I do wish
her dead, I have no desire to have her blood upon my head. The poor
devil, I believe, once loved me more than her own soul; for she would
have hazarded that, had she believed it would have pleasured me; and







                                          <pb id="p.351" n="351"/>

perhaps she has, if what the canting priests tell us be true. She is safe
enough where she is for the present; and, by and by, we can find a
way to dispose of her. But I should like to see the mechanism of this
man-trap, for such I suppose it was originally."
 </p><p>  Brassinjaw, who was rather proud of the mechanical improvement
he had made in this "plaything," as he called it, took Nino into the
next apartment-opened the cupboard, and there pointed out the rope
which he had now made to pass through a hole in the top of the closet,
and which, when pulled violently, drew out the bolts, and the trap fell,
as we have seen. But the part he was most vain of, was his own contrivance for raising the floor again, and fastening it as securely as before.  Nino's praise put Brassinjaw in high spirits, and they once more
returned to the other room. They began soon to discuss what to them
was of vital importance-namely, how to dispose of Anne, whom, from
Brassinjaw's discovery, they knew to be Hewet's daughter.  Nino's
scheme they now felt was much more likely to bring them a rope than
a fortune; and both Spikely and Brassinjaw were not over nice in their
expressions of anger against him for having led them into such a scrape.
So violently did their altercations become at one moment, that the
Italian drew his knife, and, flying towards the door, which he held in his
hand, that he might secure a retreat, swore " that the first who stirred
a foot towards him, should find it buried in his side."
 </p><p> " We are all fools," roared out Spikely, " worse than fools, to lose
our time in quarreling, when every moment is of consequence. Sit
down. Nino, sit down, and let us talk like men! What shall we do
with the girl ? that is the question."
 </p><p> Nino proposed that they should take her back towards the Heath,
in a like state to that in which they had brought her, and there leave
her to chance; but this plan Brassinjaw shewed at once was absurd;
for he overheard enough to let him know that she was fully aware of
the place of her imprisonment.
 </p><p> Brassinjaw had inwardly made up his own mind exactly what he should
do, which was nothing short of betraying his two friends, and by the
restoration of Hewet's daughter, gain all the honour and advantage to
himself. But Brassinjaw knew his companions too well not to be very
guarded in his movements; so he put on a more ferocious bearing than
either of the others, and swore "he saw no better plan than the trap
and water."
 </p><p> " No," said Spikely, " not for her; but there is one who shall taste
it, and shall be made to know the treat she is to have before she has it,
and that is Nan. I feared that we should never meet again; but we
have; and I have dogged her to her hiding-place; if once I can lure her
here, she and I will settle our long reckoning; when she's gone, then
I can look to my other friends. Horton's my next, but he, the villain,
shall be tortured, and soundly too, before I give him the coup de grace."
</p><p>  "But what are we to do with the girl ?" exclaimed Nino, impatient
at hearing Spikely talk of nothing else but his own concerns.
</p><p>  "Yes," said Brassinjaw, "what are we to do with the girl? she
must not stop here."
</p><p>  Now, that she should stop where she was, was exactly what he







<pb id="p.352" n="352"/>                    .

wished; but he knew his customers, as he thought, so said exactly contrary to what he really wished; but as one conjuror generally knows the
tricks of another, so does one rogue understand the shifts and deceits
of his compeer; therefore Spikely, hearing Brassinjaw so vehement upon
the subject, first of the girl's destruction, and then on the importance of
her removal, began to suspect the truth, so said--"Always right,
always right, Brassinjaw-leave a priest alone for that.  Yes, the girl
must not stay here; but I know where she can stay, and safely, until
we determine upon her fate, and that is in my old house, by the Black
Arch of the Clink."
</p><p>  Brassinjaw felt that Spikely would, while speaking, fix his eyes upon
him, so put on a look of the greatest innocence; and being quite a
match for Spikely, or any one else, in the art of deceit, made a strong
opposition to this arrangement, for he was sure then Spikely would
carry out his plan. Brassinjaw, like a good general, was not to be
taken by surprise, by any sudden movement of the enemy. No, no, the
instant his opponent wheeled about, he too presented a new front. In an
instant he had formed a combination in his own mind, that would
lead to victory quite as surely as his first scheme; indeed it was only
marching by a different road which led to the same end.  It was now
settled that at ten that night she should be taken to the Clink. Brassinjaw was appointed to mix a strong opiate in her food, so that she might
be carried off once more in a sleeping state.
</p><p>  They now broke up their consultation, and each went to his various
affairs.
</p><p>  Spikely would willingly have thrown his friends over, had he seen a
safe way of doing it, but was fain to be contented for the present with
his self-promised revenge upon his wife and Horton.
</p><p>  Nino started off to make one more effort to gain the good opinion of
his enraged master, but if he failed in that, he, like Brassinjaw, had
fully determined, to get what he could for himself by turning virtuous,
as he called it, and betraying his companions.
 </p><p> Ever since the attack of the thieves upon Alyce and her daughter, and
from which danger Lerue had rescued them, the merchant had determined to bring his family once more to town, the moment he could find
a suitable mansion; for be it known that William Hewet had risen So
high in the estimation of his brother citizens, that ere long he woul no
doubt be called upon to fill the highest post of honour the city could
bestow, that of Lord Mayor. He had already been one of the Common
Council, was an Alderman, and indeed enjoyed every mark of distinction
that a wealthy honest merchant could desire. Under these circumstances, and finding himself so frequently coming in contact with the
highest in the land, who from admiration of his character for worth and
probity, had in more than one instance allowed these frequent meetings
upon business, to end in settled friendship, there were, indeed, few
nobles of that day, notwithstanding the proud bearing to others they
ever maintained, who looked upon it as any degradation to rank Master
William Hewet amongst their friends; but it must also be remembered
that at this time many of the nobles were themselves merchants; we
say, therefore, that under all these circumstances, it became absolutely








                                           <pb id="p.353" n="353"/>

  necessary that his style of living now should take a more exalted position in the eyes of the world, so he bought a magnificent mansion in
  Philpot Lane, so called from the name of the owner, Sir John Philpot,
  who dwelt there.
  </p><p>  After the trial at Westminster, the whole of Hewet's party adjourned to this new mansion.  It was not yet in a state for him to take
  up his permanent abode there, but for a day or two it was determined
  that Alyce, and indeed all the inmates of the Cottage on the Heath, should
  abide there. Had it not been for the dreadful gloom which the loss
  of Anne had necessarily cast upon the feelings of all, how happily would
  have been that party, at the triumphant termination of Eoline and her
  husband's troubles. As may be supposed, every care that kindness
  of heart could imagine, was bestowed upon the Abbess, whose determination was, should she recover from the shock her whole frame had
  received from fear and suffering in the storm, to retire to some
  convent, in a foreign land, and end her days in prayer and penitence.
 </p><p>   The Cripple, notwithstanding the natural joy he felt at the strange
  change which had taken place in his fortunes, would listen to no word
  but such as touched upon the loss of Anne; indeed, until some tidings
  of her should be received, all appeared determined not to allow one
  moment to be passed in selfish happiness.
 </p><p>   When Edward returned from the earl's mansion, all, but Flora and
  the Bridge-shooter were astounded at the news, that Lerue was indeed
  the Lord Talbot. Edward enlightened his friends, as far as he felt
  authorised to do, as to the cause of the young lord appearing upon the
  Heath, in the humble guise of a poor artist.
 </p><p>   "How strange," said Alyce, " that one so exalted, should have felt
 any interest in the company of us, plain, simple folk; I am sure his
 attentions to our poor lost child, were as kind as though she had been
 his sister."
 </p><p>   And a little kinder too, thought Flora, as she gave a peculiar glance
 towards the Bridge-shooter.
"A great deal kinder," sighed Edward, to himself; and in his
thoughts, he said, " a great deal kinder than mine were when I was
her brother; and I must never now show how kind I could be, since I
know that mine are no longer a brother's feelings."
 </p><p>   The merchant and Alyce scarcely knew how to keep their expressions
 of gratitude within bounds, when Edward informed them, that Lord
 Talbot had promised not to leave a stone unturned, in his endeavour to
 serve them.
 </p><p>   Poor Edward, much as he prayed for the discovery of Anne, still more
 fervently prayed that it might be some other than the young lord, who
 should be blessed by making that discovery. Had there been wanting
 on his own part any stimulant to exertion, he could not have found a
 stronger, than in the feelings of rivalry that entered his breast, with
 regard to a determination not to allow another to rob him of the prize
 he coveted-a simple prize, but to him inestimable-the grateful smile
 of Anne, which she was sure to bestow upon her preserver.  New
 schemes were laid down and discussed. As in all such cases, one
 thought one thing, one another; but upon this point they were all








<pb id="p.354" n="354"/>                    .

agreed, that Anne had been stolen away, most likely for the purpose of
gaining a high reward for her restoration.  This idea turned all their
thoughts upon the best method of announcing such reward, and, at all
events, the reward being offered, would give great publicity to the fact
of her being missing, and might thus lead to some good end.
 </p><p>  They were very busily drawing up an account of the abduction, for
 such they called it, the idea of her death having been completely given
 up, when a stranger was announced, as awaiting an interview with the
 merchant, upon business of the greatest importance. The merchant
 was too much accustomed to have messengers calling upon him at all
 hours, on business of the greatest importance, for him to feel the least
 surprise; so, taking up a lamp, for it was already dark, he, with Edward,
 descended the grand old staircase of massive carved oak, down to the
 marble-paved hall. Here Edward left his master, as he had affairs to
 transact that night in his own apartment on the Bridge.
 </p><p>  Ever since his interview with the young lord, the reader may easily
imagine that little else was floating in his mind but what was connected
in some way with what that lord had said. Never did he remember to
have entered the Golden Fleece with a heart so thoroughly depressed
as he did upon this night; a kind of listless despair had taken complete
possession of his mind, for he felt that even were Anne restored, she was
now more hopelessly lost to him than ever.
  </p><p> " Al !" he said, "the merchant need no longer be apprehensive of his
daughter being married to a man who loves her not, and who will wed
her but for her father's known wealth ; if such as the heir to an earldom,
and a rich one too, offer her his hand, it can be but for the worth of that
hand alone: happy father, happy bride, where both are so convinced
that love has brought the hand that's offered! But does he love her
more than I do ?-impossible--but I have nought but love to offer, and
even had we plighted our troth, I should always have been suspected of
wedding her wealth more than herself. I would rather tear out my
heart," he exclaimed, " than live under such an unworthy imputation!
It is perhaps better as it is; for she being rich, and I almost poor, the
sincerity of my affection never could have been put to the proof."
 </p><p>  The whole of that evening, as he sat working at his account books,
would such reflections as these mix themselves up with the more
worldly affairs that lay before him; the clock had already struck nine,
when shutting his books, he rested his head upon his hand, and covering
his eyes, became lost in a sort of dreamy melancholy abstraction; there
he sat, immoveable as if entranced.
  When the merchant entered the large unfurnished waiting-room, in
which the stranger was, he saw a man closely muffled in a cloak, and
altogether of such a suspicious looking character, that Hewet for a
moment paused, as if doubtful whether to close the door behind him or
not.
 </p><p> " Be not alarmed," said the stranger, "I am a friend."
 </p><p> The merchant at once recognised a voice that was familiar to him,
but who the speaker was he had still to learn.
 </p><p> " I am not often alarmed," replied the merchant smiling, " but I must







                                           <pb id="p.355" n="355"/>

own your mysterious appearance for the moment did surprise me-what
would you with me ?"
</p><p>  To which the other replied-" You have lost your daughter !"
 </p><p> "If it be on her account you come, then indeed you are a friend-
speak quickly !"
 </p><p> "Slow and sure," observed the other; "and before I can let you into
too much of what you will wish to know, I have a question or two to
be answered; and it will depend on the answers I shall receive, whether
I throw off my cloak, or depart again unknown. You have lost your
daughter; but that I know; and you would doubtless give a good
reward to any one who should put you in the way of finding her ?"
 </p><p> "He should   be rewarded, to his heart's content," replied the
merchant, beginning to tremble with anxious hope.
 </p><p> " You are a merchant, therefore a man of business," said the stranger,
"so I will attempt to speak in a business-like manner; would you give
five hundred pounds of right lawful money ?"
 </p><p> " A thousand !" said the merchant, in a tone of supplicating anxiety.
 </p><p> "Now, to show you," replied the other, "how much I will do for
love to serve you, I will not take advantage of that offer, but fix the
reward at a good five hundred pounds; for the payment I must have
your bond ; and for the next security I must have your oath: before I
speak further you must swear, that come of this meeting what may,
you will never drag me forward to give evidence against any one who
may have been implicated in the affair.  I hazard my life in doing
what I do, unless you swear to keep my secret."
  </p><p>" The most solemn vow that the heart can conceive I freely take,"
replied the merchant: " now, who and what are you-and what is the
hope you bring ?"
</p><p>  "Tis not hope I bring," said the stranger, " but certainty-my name
is Brassinjaw." Saying this he disclosed himself to the eyes of the astonished merchant.
 </p><p> " Brassinjaw !" he exclaimed, " what, in Heaven's name, can you know
of my lost child ?"
 </p><p> " Every thing," was the other's reply; " but the share I have taken in
this transaction has been done, as you may be sure, more out of pity for,
and hope to shelter innocence, than any desire to gain reward; although
I'm no father, I know a father's sufferings; but I will not give way to
feeling," and the old rascal pretended to wipe away a tear. " There is one
more point upon which you must solemnly pledge me your word, and that
is to be guided entirely by me; for if but a grain of suspicion were to
find its way into the brain of those, who like myself hold the secret, not
only my life, but that of your child would be the immediate sacrifice."
 </p><p> " Only restore my lost child to these arms, and be not afraid either of
reward or caution."
 </p><p> Of all the surprises the merchant had lately received, few were greater
than that caused by hearing that Anne, for whom they had been hunting
far and wide, was the inmate of the Cardinal's Hat, the next door to his
own abode.
 </p><p> " Oh, let me fly to her rescue !" exclaimed Hewet, forgetting all his
promises of caution; and as he said this he made a movement towards







<pb id="p.356" n="356"/>                   .

the door, but was held back by Brassinjaw, who began to tremble for his
own safety.
 </p><p> " Are you mad ?" he said; "would you destroy me, and her, and
with me all hope of saving her ? Be calm, and listen; follow but my instructions, and this very night shall see Anne Hewet beneath her father's
roof."
 </p><p> The merchant, endeavouring to calm his feelings, made many enquiries
about the cause of her being taken to the place she was in.
 </p><p> " Those," replied Brassinjaw, " who brought her there knew not who
she was; they thought her name was Allen, and that she was some insignificant trader's girl; it was I who discovered the truth; when all
my old love and friendship for you and yours returned to my breast, and
I vowed inwardly to save her or sacrifice my life. Ah, old friendships
Master Hewet, are sweet ties; but I'll not give way to feeling," and
again the old rascal passed his hand over his eyes.
 </p><p> The merchant was too engrossed by his own hopes, his fears, his
anxieties of every conflicting kind, to attend much to what fell from the
lips of Brassinjaw, excepting when upon the subject nearest to his heart.
 </p><p> Hewet now enquired what was the plan to be pursued.
 </p><p> " A very simple one," replied Brassinjaw. "The rats will walk quietly
into the trap I have set, depend upon it, unless we scare them by being
too anxious to secure them: many a rat has escaped through the
catcher's hurry.  My plan is this-you see, so alarmed are those who
have her in their power, at finding whom she is, that they scarcely know
how to move; so it has been determined, that, for a time she shall be
kept securely in an old house in the Clink."
 </p><p> How the mention of that vile place called up to the memory of the
merchant, the danger his child had once before suffered on that spot !
 </p><p> " Now, at ten this night," continued Brassinjaw, " when all upon the
Bridge will be dark and quiet, it is settled that she shall be removed
but whether by the Bridge-road, or in a boat, I am uncertain, so we
must be prepared for both emergencies. You must place yourself, with
some dozen stout men of authority around the Southwark gate, but not
in a way to cause suspicion. Keep all as quiet and out of sight as
possible. At that hour the tide will be at its safest, so let the Bridge-
shooter, and Willy-of-the-bridge, be near the arch beneath my house;
let them have plenty of aid within call, for those they will have to
deal with are none of the meekest, and use their knives as freely upon
the flesh of man, as a humble sinner like myself would upon that of a
bull. Come which way they will, you will easily know them, for at that
hour there will be but few others moving about, and between them they
will carry something wrapped round in a sail-cloth; the moment you
are sure 'tis they, fly upon them in a body, for singly, or in pairs you
are a match for neither of them; bind them hand and foot-knock out
their brains if you like, but as you value the safety of my throat let
them not escape; if either should do so, you need not fear that I shall
ever come to trouble you for my reward, or pay you another visit, unless
it be at the dead of night, by your bedside as a ghost with a bleeding
throat, to upbraid you for my untimely death. When the guilty ones
are secured, remember that I am not to be named; but I will take care







                                       <pb id="p.357" n="357"/>
that plenty of other crimes shall be proved against them, that shall stop
up every loop-hole of escape; if they live, some of us will die, depend
on that."
 </p><p> "But you have not told me how we are to find my child."
 </p><p> "Why, in the sail-cloth; did I not say so before ?"
 </p><p> "Good Heavens, she will be dead !" exclaimed the merchant.
 </p><p> "Fear not that-she's used to it: but be not alarmed because she
seems to lie in death, for to prevent a chance of her screaming she will
be put to sleep, sounder than ever but once she slept before; only keep
your faith with me, act to the letter as I have directed, and all will be
well for you and yours, however it may turn out for me, or my companions. Now then I must away, or all may yet go wrong."
 </p><p> Saying this he again muffled himself in his long cloak, pulled his hat
closely over his face, and then stealthily, and with as little noise as possible, quitted the merchant's new dwelling.
 </p><p> " Yes," said he to himself, as he hurried towards the Bridge, " they
would dupe and fool a priest, would they? but father Brassinjaw was
never yet cajoled by man, no, nor woman, and that's something for a
man to say, and he's not to begin the trade of fool as late in the day as
it is with him. I begin to fear them, so the sooner they are comfortably
settled the sooner my own comfort will be secured."
 </p><p> The merchant for a time felt so oppressed with hope and fear, that he
could scarcely believe the visit Brassinjaw had just paid him was more
than the flighty wandering of the mind-a waking dream. So doubtful
did he feel upon the question, that before he related what had happened,
he called his servitor, and enquired of him if any one had really been
there.
</p><p>  The man stared at his master, and well he might; for he had to
remind him that the strange man had scarcely left the place five minutes.
</p><p>  "No, no," he said, when he had sent the man to summon the
Bridge-shooter and the Cripple; " it must be real-it is no dream; but
oh, Heavens, if it be true! then I shall once more see my darling child
and that too, perhaps, within this hour, for time flies apace."
 </p><p> When the Cripple and the Bridge-shooter heard the strange tale, they
were scarcely less surprised than the merchant had been; but instead
of losing a moment in doubting whether it could be a fact or not, they,
more wisely, felt that even such a chance should not be slightly let go
by. It was thought advisable not to tell Alyce of their hopes in case of
failure, nor even to make Flora privy to their attempt; the only debateable point was, whether they should apprize Osborne; but, upon reflection, it was thought advisable not even to let him know aught about it.
 </p><p>  The merchant was soon on his road to obtain the proper assistance, as
were the Bridge-shooter and the Cripple in their locality. The night
proved clear, but very windy, the wind blowing strongly from the south.
As Brassinjaw had said, "the tide was at the safest;" so William
placed a boat, well manned, within the shadow of each of four of the
arches near to that beneath the Cardinal's Hat, but not those exactly the
next to it; he had provided himself with a loud whistle, with which he
was to call them suddenly to the one spot. They were all upon the
watch soon after nine; never did father await so anxiously the coming







<pb id="p.358" n="358"/>                    .

of his child as did the poor merchant upon that bleak night: every moment the wind became stronger, but still it continued to blow from the
south.
 </p><p> Here we will leave them for a time, and again visit Edward in his
solitude.-He was just about retiring to rest, when he fancied he saw a
flash of lightning against his bed-room window-soon after he saw
another-and then a distant humming sound reached his ear-and the
lightning became more frequent, and lasted longer; at that time of
year, and in such a night, it could not be lightning; so to clear up the
point, he opened his casement, and looking out, saw a great flaring of
light just beyond the Bridge in Southwark; the light increasing rapidly,
soon proved to him, that there must be at least some half dozen houses
on fire. People were now hurrying across the Bridge from the City side
towards the scene of conflagration, and a general cry of "fire" began to
resound from every quarter. As quickly as he could, he resumed his
attire, and hoping to do some little good, he hastened from his master's
house and joined the excited throng.
 </p><p> The wind, as we have said, blew strongly from the south, and on
its wings brought burning flakes of fire far upon the Bridge, many persons there were already injured by them. It must be remembered that
the merchant's house lay on the City end, so that Edward had to travere
nearly the whole length of the Bridge before he reached the Southwark
Gate; here he found the crowd beginning to retreat, for it appeared,
that the houses at that end were entirely enveloped in flames, and there
was, that way, neither ingress nor egress possible.  Knowing the combustible nature of the greater portion of the houses on the Bridge,
Edward's first anxiety, fearing the worst, was to hurry back to his
master's house, to collect all their valuable account books, and remove
them to some place of safety. Although he believed it to be his duty
to make all sure, as far as lay in his power, he did not much fear the
fire reaching their dwelling, because he calculated that at the first open
ing on the Bridge, even if it came so far, there it would meet with a
certain check. He gave a lad, whom he met hurrying towards the
Southwark end, some money to return to the City and apprise the merchant of the danger on the Bridge.  Edward little imagined, that at
that moment his master was in the very midst of the fire in Southwark
and in agony at being thus shut off from reaching the dwelling where in
he knew his child was lying. Just as Edward was entering the Golden
Fleece, he heard the people say, that the flames had passed the first
opening, and that they feared the whole Bridge would be destroyed
Not a moment was now to be lost; he hurried from room to room, collect
ing every paper that he thought could be of value to his master; just as
he was about to carry his load away, notwithstanding the increasing
danger, he could not resist the temptation of rushing up to his own
room, and  secure his writing-case, for in that were all the letters Anne`
had ever written to him; this delay, trifling as it really was, had nearly
cost him his life, for by the time he again descended, the roadway of the
Bridge opposite his door, had been so choked up with goods and chattels
that he found it impossible to pass out. It now struck him that the







                                           <pb id="p.359" n="359"/>

Bafer way of all would be by the roofs of the houses; and to make the
attempt, he once more ascended to his room.
  </p><p> The noise below was now becoming deafening, and one universal shriek
of horror filled his ears; he hastened to the roof, when the cause of the
new alarm met his eyes - the wind which, at the beginning, when the
fire was in its infancy, brought alarming flakes of burning wood across the
bridge, as the body of flame increased, so increased this shower of burning
embers; they had lodged upon, and ignited the northern end of the Bridge,
which now was burning almost as fiercely as the Southwark end. The
shrieks and cries of the crowd on the Bridge were maddening, for the
multitude that had rushed on from the city end, and had completely filled
the Bridge, were, as it might be said, caught in a trap of fire. Hundreds
of boats were now approaching from every part of the river; every aid
that could be leant, towards saving the poor wretches that were hemmed
in between two devouring fires, was rendered; people from every window
were seen, some calling for aid, others lowering themselves by ropes
into the vessels beneath, while many, in despair, were casting themselves
headlong into the river, flying from a death of fire into a watery grave.
 </p><p> Edward, looking around, stood petrified at the awfulness of the dreadful scene; he saw no one but himself upon the roofs, for who, in such a
place as the Bridge, could expect to find safety there ? But had the
City end not have already caught, the escape that way was not so wild
in its conception. He now gave himself up for lost, certain death appeared close before his eyes; there was one point from which he could
scarcely withdraw his eyes-that was the Bridge-gate tower, the ghastly
heads were lighted up by the surrounding flames, with a supernatural
glare-the red glow upon the cheeks, gave the dead features a living
light; they shook in the wind, as though they laughed at the destruction
of those who had once looked with smiles upon their agonizing doom.
What could he do ?-was he to stand there immoveable until the
shrivelling flames surrounded him with their fiery arms, nor give up
their embrace until he had crumbled into dust ? At this moment of
despair, a new hope flashed across his mind like a ray of inspiration.-
" Yes, yes!" he exclaimed, almost overcome to tears, with the sudden
hope, "I know, I know the way! if I can gain the sterlings by the
outlet beneath the Cardinal's Hat, I may yet be saved." He flew to
the roof door, but it was securely fastened-his eye fell upon a skylight-
another moment, and it was dashed in by his own weight, he fell heavily
upon the railing of a gallery, he caught it as he fell, the bars gave way,
and he found himself precipitated into the room beneath; in this there
was a lamp burning, but looking round, he had nearly dropped to the
earth in horror and surprise, for on a couch he beheld the senseless
body of the merchant's child. He stood motionless for a moment, his
eyes fixed upon the spectre, as he believed it to be; but so true to
nature was its every lineament, that he could not resist the impulse of
approaching it, and laying his hand upon its heart.
 </p><p> " Heavens !" he exclaimed, " 'tis no vision; blood and bone are here,
and pulsation beats within this heart-she sleeps! Awake, awake! if
indeed, my senses mock me not, and thou be Anne's sweet self, awake !"
 </p><p> He raised her on his arm, she sighed, but woke not. The shrieks and






<pb id="p.360" n="360"/>
roaring of the flames, called him again to a full sense of his dreadful
position, now doubly dreadful, if indeed the being he held was not a
mere mockery of a distempered brain. He took her in his arms, the
door had been slightly fastened, but his strength soon shattered it before
him. He had descended but a short way, when his further progress
was stayed by the flames having burst through from his own dwelling,
and were rapidly devouring the stairs by which he had hoped to escape.
He flew into a room, the door of which was open; this room looked out
upon the bridge; he dashed the window out, and observing a beam some
distance below, reaching across to the opposite side, which was not yet
in flames, he with great difficulty, at last succeeded in reaching it safely
with his precious charge; the footing was so insecure, that, laden as he
was, he must have fallen, but for the friendly aid of a single line that
had been stretched across to hang streamers from upon some late festive
occasion; even then the attempt was one of peril, for did he once swerve
from his balance, the line would have snapped like a thread, and then
both must have met with death.
 </p><p> When once he had gained the opposite dwelling, he lost not a moment,
but hastened down; here all was despair; but his one hope still remained,
the outlet by the sterling. He passed as quickly as he could through
the heaps of boxes, bales, and other things that lay about; entered the
now-deserted Cardinal's Hat, he reached the lower room, when, to his
surprise, he heard a groan, and then a cry far help; for a moment ha
deposited his dearest treasure on a settle that stood by, and went to the
spot whence the cry had issued, when opening a door, he there found a
female bound hand and foot- it was the Italian girl; in another moment
she was free, and quickly comprehending their danger, she allowed not
surprise to check her power to act. The trap in the floor was soon
raised, and, oh joy beyond hope realized, the very boat beneath was
that of the Bridge-shooter and the Cripple. The sleeping Anne, and then
Mona, was lowered into the boat, Edward hanging, for an instant, by
his hands on the edge of the opening, dropped into the bark, and all
were safe.
 </p><p> As they rowed towards the shore, they looked back aghast at the
fearful devastation going on upon the Bridge; at many parts the buildings
were so undermined by the fire, that no boats dare go near to rescue those
who, seeing no other chance of escape, flung themselves into the stream.
More than one dwelling, almost entire, fell over into the flood, and
bore down to destruction all that were beneath. If aught could at that
moment of thankfulness have given a deeper joy to Edward's heart, it
was, that, just after they had reached a spot beyond the danger from the
burning timbers that were falling from the Bridge, they run foul of the
merchant's barge.
 </p><p> Hewet, when all hope had ceased of gaining admittance to the Bridge
by the Southwark side, and hearing of the disastrous conflagration having
gained possession of the opposite end of the Bridge, saw no possible
chance of rescuing his child, but by the way of the sterling beneath
Brassinjaw's abode; he was now on his way thither, either to save her or
die with her in the flames, when, as if by Providence directed, he came

<figure id="fig.00022" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.030.DO01.00022"><head>The Fire on the Bridge</head> </figure>




                                            <pb id="p.361" n="361"/>
suddenly upon the boat in which she was being conveyed, as it were, from
death to life.
  </p><p> "She's saved, she's saved !" exclaimed Edward, starting up in the boat.
  </p><p> "And she'll be lost again as soon as found," roared out the Bridge-
shooter, "if you let your mad joy upset the boat."  Then addressing
the merchant, who seemed upon the point of springing forward into their
bark-" Sit quiet, master; we have her safe, and that knowledge is quite
happiness enough for the next ten minutes, I'm sure." Saying this he
pulled Edward back to his seat, and giving a peculiar whistle to the
boatmen, which they seemed perfectly to understand, they plied their
oars with double vigour, and started forward some boats' length in advance of the merchant's barge.
</p><p>   Hewet, scarcely daring to believe his senses, felt, that in the crowded
state the river then was, let it be a dream or not, that the Bridge-
shooter's commands were not to be slighted, so sat as quietly as his
intensely-wrought feelings would permit, until they were all safely
landed at the Old Swan Stairs.
 </p><p>  It would be impossible to express in words all the varied feelings
which filled the breasts of the inmates of the merchant's mansion on that
eventful night; we shall therefore pass over the scene in silence.
 </p><p>  When the fire on the Bridge had been subdued, and the ruins could
be examined, the destruction was found to be awful with regard to
human life; it is said that not less than three thousand persons perished
either in the flames, or by drowning; hundreds who were closed in upon
the Bridge, by the fire having been carried on the winds from the Southwark to the City end, and thus forming two devouring furnaces both raging
at the same time, were literally roasted to death, as in a burning cage. It
was almost miraculous, considering the locality, and the materials of which
the greater portion of the houses were constructed, that a single dwelling
should have escaped; but many did entirely, and more that were but
partially burned; of the latter number, was the celebrated Cardinal's Hat.
It is true that all the upper portion was consumed, but that part which
remained, our amiable friend, Brassinjaw, soon turned to good account.
A very few days sufficed to render the Bridge again passable for foot
passengers, and as such a work could not be achieved without a vast
number of workmen, mine host managed to carry on a roaring trade, not
only amongst these labourers, but with a better class of customers,
namely, the inquisitive who came in throngs to visit this extraordinary
scene of devastation. The hair-breadth escapes that he recounted as
having fallen to his own share, were beyond belief, but were still listened
to with infinite delight. He hit upon one bright idea to bring grist to
his mill, and that was, in drawing attention to the circumstance, that
whilst nearly every thing was consumed around it, the sign of the holy
Cardinal's Hat remained uninjured. A few years before, and he would
have boldly announced it as a miracle; but times having somewhat
changed, he merely hinted at such a thing, and these hints had their
weight with many who always will see superhuman aid, where they
should only look for simple cause and effect. The fact was the sign-board
had fallen down just after Osborne had passed across the beam, and had
been lying, snugly protected, beneath some iron goods that were








<pb id="p.362" n="362"/>                     .

heaped upon it, until Brassinjaw found it uninjured the next day, and
had then, with his own hands replaced it in its former conspicuous station,
not dreaming of turning such a trifle to account, until some one pointed out
to him " how miraculous it was, that in such a position, the Cardinal's
Hat alone should remain unscathed."
</p><p>  Brassinjaw caught at the idea, and soon managed to turn it to good
account.  There was one circumstance puzzled him a good deal, and
that was why he had not seen either Spikely or Nino; his great hope
was that they had perished in the flames. That Anne had been rescued
he was most agreeably assured of, by receiving his promised reward,
which having obtained, he did not trouble himself greatly to enquire
how.
 </p><p> The true cause of Spikely and Nino having become invisible to their
friend, lay in the fact of their having been fully convinced of Brassinjaw's
betrayal of them. Cautiously as he had managed his interview with the
merchant, his movements had not escaped the watchful eye of Spikely.
 </p><p> It appeared that Spikely, suspecting the others' intention, lay in wait
for him, and dogged his steps to the very place he imagined he would go
to, namely, to the merchant's mansion; the moment he had entered the
door, Spikely hurried away to find Nino, and acquaint him with the discovery he had made with regard to Brassinjaw's treachery. Fearing
that they would be denounced, they fled at once from London, and
remained some time concealed, forming plans of vengeance against their
betrayer, and also some other plans which will be revealed in due time.
  </p><p>The Bridge being the only passage for horses and waggons, that then
connected the City of London with the southern side of the river, it was of
too much importance to remain long in a ruinous state, so that every exertion was made to render the roadway passable, and to fit up temporary sheds where the shops had been totally destroyed.
 </p><p> The merchant's dwelling was entirely consumed, and here rose up one
of those slightly constructed edifices; those portions that lay in the
stone-work of the Bridge were soon re-wainscoted, and rendered inhabitable; above these came the new shop with one room behind it; and
this, for some time after the fire, constituted the only place of business of
the great merchant, Master Hewet of the Bridge.</p>

EDWARD OSBORNE s anxiety on account of the state of stupor in which
Anne continued all the next day after the fire, was so great, that upon
every occasion he could steal away from his superintendence of the
searching the ruins of the Golden Fleece, he had hastened away to his




                      <pb id="p.363" n="363"/>

master's new mansion; at his third visit, he learnt that returning consciousness had began to appear; this made his heart beat with delight;
but a great damp was at the same time cast over his mind, by hearing
that the merchant had the moment before left the house for the purpose
of paying his dutiful respects to Lord Talbot, to apprise that young
nobleman of the happy discovery and restoration of his lost child, and to
thank his lordship for the great interest he had shown upon the occasion
of Anne's abduction.
 </p><p> All the joy poor Osborne had experienced at having been, as he felt,
the heaven-directed instrument of salvation of his heart's adored, vanished
upon hearing where his master had gone. All the young nobleman
had told him, again presented itself to his memory, and he now felt little
doubt, that Lord Talbot would at once disclose his intentions to the
father. So anxious was he that his own secret should not be guessed at,
that he determined at once to acquaint the merchant with his intention
to leave England for ever; for as he said to himself-" If I express my
wishes before I am supposed to know of the great honour intended to
his family, Master Hewet will not set down my sudden determination to
any disappointed hopes on my part."
 </p><p> When the merchant did return, he was in high glee; and upon hearing of the rapid progress his child had made towards recovery, during
his absence, he exclaimed-" This I shall now for ever regard as the
most fortunate day of my life, excepting one, my Alyce dear, and that
one was the day on which you consented to be mine !" Upon saying this,
he most unceremoniously gave his spouse a hearty kiss of real affection.
-" Why, what are you staring at, boy ?" continued Hewet, addressing
Edward. " You need not blush at seeing an honest husband kiss an
honest wife! And may Heaven grant you the same blessing, of being
able to say, after you have been wedded as many years as we have,
that the day your loved one, for I suppose you will have a loved one,
one of these days, told you she was yours, can still be regarded as the
most fortunate day of your life !"
</p><p>   That the merchant should be thus happy did not appear unnatural,
considering it was the first day after the finding his child. But Osborne, who delighted in tormenting himself, as all do who really love,
felt that there was another cause, and a strong one too, for the merchant's excessive joy, and that was, the proposal, which he doubted not,
had already been made to Master Hewet, by the heir of Shrewsbury.
  </p><p> When Anne recovered her senses, the first person who met her dreaming gaze, was the Italian girl, Mona, watching by her couch, as she had
seen her watching once before. All that had passed between them,
came vividly to her recollection; but looking round, she discovered such
splendid luxury on every side, that, for the moment, she fancied she
must be wandering in the mysterious realms of sleep. It was some time
before Mona could convince her, that all she gazed at was no vision, but
reality; but when she learnt that she was once again beneath a father's
roof, her senses had nearly flown, so powerful was the revulsion of feeling that had seized upon her heart.-" Oh, no, no !" she exclaimed, " it
cannot be-it cannot be ! such happiness is not to bless the wretched
Anne ! 'tis all illusion-all illusion !"







<pb id="p.364" n="364"/>                    .
 </p><p> Mona endeavoured, by every means, to explain, but the sufferer's
mind was too bewildered by the power of the drugs, and by her newborn hopes and fears, to comprehend easily what the Italian girl was
saying; but having become somewhat calmer, Mona summoned the
merchant and Alyce into the room.
 </p><p> It was now no longer possible to doubt her senses; she felt her arms
were really around the necks of her doting parents-that their tears of
joy, now mingling with her own, were the true outpourings of a beating
heart. When Anne beheld Edward enter, an involuntary blush suffused her lovely face, and her eyes, unbidden, turned imploringly towards Mona, as if to say, " you alone know my secret-do not betray
me."
 </p><p> Had there required one more rivet, to fasten immovably love's chain
around the captive heart of Osborne, that rivet was soon applied, and
proved to be one that could never again be loosened; for when all the
dangers, from which she had so miraculously escaped, were related to
the now happy girl, and when she learnt that her life had a second time
been saved by him, to whom she had in secret given up her whole heart,
she cast upon him one look of such intense gratitude, that, with the
rapidity of thought, it flew through his own eyes into his heart, and
there took root for ever. How such a look would have blessed any
other man! but, alas! to Osborne, it seemed a doom.
 </p><p> From that instant, he felt that he could have endured the agony of
perishing in the flames, with less of anguish, than he now knew he must
endure at parting from her for ever; but every new accession of affection
that seized upon his heart, and seemed to bind him closer and closer to
her, determined him to fly more quickly then ever from the maddening spell.
  </p><p>That very night, after all the other inmates of the place had retired
to rest, he prayed of the merchant to grant him a few minutes of private converse.
 </p><p> So unusual a circumstance caused the merchant unfeigned surprise.
 </p><p> " And what," said he, smiling, " is the mighty matter we have in
hand, boy, that should keep us from our couches at so late an hour as
this? To-morrow, to-morrow, I'll be sworn, will be time enough, and
there is a time for every thing, you know."
 </p><p> " And that this is the time for what I have to say," replied Osborne,
" I feel convinced; for what I wish to say, cannot be said too soon."
</p><p>  Edward had put on such a serious look, that the merchant felt himself constrained to feel serious too; so, without speaking, he resumed
his seat, and pointing to another for Edward, awaited patiently any
communication Osborne might wish to make.
 </p><p> It was not until after some hesitation, and turning deadly pale, that
Edward thus began-" That you have always treated-nay, loved me,
as a son, and that I have ever honoured and loved you as a father, needs
but little effort, on either of our parts, to make apparent. Do not think
that I have forgotten all the past kindness that has, since boyhood, been
lavished upon me by all beneath your roof. Do not think me ungrateful for what I am going to say; it arises from no selfish feeling-it springs
from no wayward love of change; but-but-master, I intend to leave







                                            <pb id="p.365" n="365"/>
you." As he said this, he felt his whole heart rise into his very throat.
 </p><p>  " Leave me!" exclaimed Hewet, leaning forward, and looking Edward full in the face.
 </p><p>  The youth's eyes filled to the brim; and taking his master's hand, he
sank his head upon it, as he repeated, firmly as his agitation would permit-" Yes, I intend to leave you."
 </p><p>  " Did I not know your character too well, to doubt whatever you
may say," replied the merchant, " I should receive such words with
doubt indeed; but as I am sure you would not thus pain yourself, nor
thus wound me, but for some potent reason, or one you believe to be
such, I will listen to all you wish to say; but upon such a theme, I shall
find it difficult not to doubt my senses. Tell me first, what has given
birth to this sudden thought ?"
 </p><p>  "With me," replied Edward, "it is no sudden thought, but one that
has never quitted me, in night or day, since first it took possession of
my mind, and that is now some time gone by."
  </p><p> " Few men," said the merchant, " ever do any thing without a motive; and I am sure that, of all men, young as he is, Edward Osborne
is the last to wish to take such a step as that he now proposes, without
some strong incentive-some almost resistless motive. You have called
me father: speak openly as a son: tell me all, and I will then advise you
truly as a father."
  </p><p> " Alas!" replied Edward, " it is because I cannot speak openly, that
I have so long delayed to acquaint you with my fixed resolve. Master,
do not press me upon the question of my reason for wishing to quit your
roof; but, believe me, I have the best of reasons."
  </p><p> " I never knew a youth yet," retorted the merchant, rather sharply,
"that did not believe himself made up of reason.  I hope, Edward, this
is no boy's whim-no childish fancy. If your reason, as you call it, be
one of common sense, why blush to own it ?"
 </p><p> " It is no whim-no childish fancy," said Edward; " but the reason
for my leaving this land will die with me. By what I have just said,
you will perceive it is my wish to quit England, and it is in your power
to let me do so, with honour to myself, and bright prospects, as regards
my future fortune lying before me.  The management of the English
factory at Antwerp, is the post I have the ambition to aspire to; your
name and influence will be sufficient to secure it for whom you will.
Will you exert that influence for your apprentice, Edward Osborne, and
thus, by opening a door, through which he may escape for ever from this
isle, render him as happy, as he can ever be, while he exists upon this
earth ?"
 </p><p> " This is a subject, from first to last," replied the merchant, " requiring more than a mere thought ere it be determined. Many of your
words have given birth to new thoughts within my breast; but this far,
I will assure you at once-the idea of Antwerp is one that I will never
oppose; there is a sound judgment shown in it, and if it be carried out,
may one day lead to city fame, and, what is quite as good, city fortune.
I will think upon what you have said, and in the morning we will again
speak more fully upon all its varied bearings. Self, self, self," continued
Hewet, " yes, self will peep out, do what we will to shut it in. I confess,







<pb id="p.366" n="366"/>

 that when you first broached this business, Edward, I felt as if
your abandoning me, would be half my ruin; thus, self peeped out on
the black side of the affair, and there it kept on peeping, until you
named Antwerp, when instantly round turned self in the opposite direction, and saw all sunshine. I like the notion more and more, the deeper
I fathom it; you will have gained a station in the mercantile world, and
I a help to my fortune, beyond what you can at present guess. But
come, boy, since it is determined that we part, out with the reason of
this step."
 </p><p> " It is a reason you must never know!" replied Osborne, evidently
mortified at the now unconcerned manner in which the merchant alluded
to their separation. " When I am gone, few, I imagine, will care
much either for me or for my reasons."
  </p><p>" Indeed, but they will; all in this house will ever care for what
concerns their well-loved friend, Master Osborne; and although the sea
will roll between us, I have ships enough to afford you a passage now
and then, to pay a visit to your former home."
 </p><p> "When once gone," said Edward, " I never more return-never !"
</p><p>  Oh, yes, boy !" replied the merchant, " yes, yes, you will; upon one
occasion, come you shall, even if I myself should have to fetch you, and
that is when Anne shall marry, and that may happen sooner than I had
thought, notwithstanding my particular ideas upon the subject. When I
visited Lord Talbot to-day-But I see you are tired, and want to go to
rest; so good night, and in the morning, as I said before, we will speak
more fully upon these matters."
 </p><p> " And such is the world," said Edward, when the merchant had retired, " such is the world. Here have I been, for days and days, fearing,
dreading, the pain I might give to him I have ever regarded as a father, and
now he knows my resolve, so far from feeling sorrow at our separation, he
rather evinces a satisfaction, bordering on delight; but it cannot surely be
his mere selfish love of gain, which, seeing in the distance, blinds him to
what he otherwise had viewed with pain ? No, that cannot be; but,
alas! I fear I guess too well the true cause of his satisfaction-his interview to-day with this young Lord Talbot; there the true cause lies
Well, be it so; if it but bring to Anne a happy heart, if I love her, as
I know I do, I should rejoice, rather than weep. How unfortunate it is
that I am compelled to be beneath the same roof with her. Had she
been at the Cottage, I might have quitted England, without again looking upon her. I will be up by times-pray of the merchant not to betray my wishes to any one, until all is settled for my departure.  I will
point out to him how much better it were for Anne, in her enfeebled
state, to be in the fresh air of the Heath, than pent up in this close un
wholesome lane. If she be once away, I can hurry on my own departure with a freer mind; but were she gone, then should I have already looked upon her for the last time in this life. That thought seems
like the parent of despair; I could not bear to leave her, without one
last adieu ! But can I bear to say to her farewell?  No, no! It were
better that we meet no more !"
 </p><p> Osborne spent half the night in devising means of avoiding Anne on







                                         <pb id="p.367" n="367"/>

the morrow, and for persuading his master to send her at once to the
Cottage of the Heath.
 </p><p> The next morning the whole house was astir betimes, for the Cripple
and his adored wife were that day to commence a long journey with
Gripclose, to take possession of one of Eoline's estates.
 </p><p> Notwithstanding the bustle in which the merchant was, Edward
found an opportunity to express his wish, that no notice might be taken,
at present, of their last night's conversation. The merchant too thought,
that, until further progress had been made in the Antwerp business,
strict silence upon the subject would be advisable; but he promised
Edward that not one unnecessary moment should be wasted in bringing
about the end desired. So far, Osborne's mind was relieved, but still
more so, when the merchant, just as the other was about to speak to the
same point, told him, he had determined that Anne should at once depart for the Cottage.
 </p><p> With the exception of Edward, who could not cast off his own sadness, all at the early morning meal wore smiling faces. Anne was the
only one absent from the board; but upon this Osborne had calculated,
or he would have found some excuse for being himself away.
 </p><p> Before they had sat down, the man of law, Master Gripclose, arrived,
and was in high glee, to think how completely they had triumphed over
that vile pretender, as he called him, Horton, whom he reported to have
absconded, and that now there were strange and horrible tales flying
about concerning him, and that it was even affirmed, the officers of justice had received information from some secret source, that, if true,
would bring him and the halter into close acquaintanceship-" But for
the truth of all this he did not vouch; but such," he said, " was the report afloat."
 </p><p> Edward and the Bridge-shooter now related the strange circumstance
of the dagger being left with them so mysteriously, and that there was
no doubting but that that dagger, or knife, had once belonged to Horton.
</p><p>  " Where is it ?" said the man of law; " such a blade as that, stained,
you say, with blood ?-
  </p><p>"No!"
 </p><p> " Well, stained with something; but which, coming in connection with
other evidence, might be regarded as blood."
 </p><p> " It will never come in connection with anything but the bottom of the
Thames," said Edward, "for it was in the very room that first fell
into the river, one mass of flames."
 </p><p> "We had much better talk of our own happy affairs," said the
merchant, "than waste our breath upon so vile a subject as Harry
Horton; but that is not his name now, nor does it matter whatever his
name may be. You ordered the light barge, William ?" he enquired of
the Bridge-shooter, " and the horses too ?"
 </p><p> "All will be ready, Master," replied William, "by the hour you
named."
 </p><p> "Well then," said the merchant, " as we shall not be much longer
together, let us laugh and be merry while we are, for I never before
saw so many in so small a party, who had so much cause for real happiness as we have. For when I look the world around --"






<pb id="p.368" n="368"/>                   .

 </p><p> What splendid figures of speech Master Hewet would have adorned
his eloquence with, can never now be even guessed at, for just as he was
" looking the world around," a servitor entered to announce a messenger
from Lord Talbot.
 </p><p> The merchant had scarcely heard the name, ere he had left the room,
not waiting even to finish his sentence.
 </p><p> Flora's eyes were immediately fixed upon Edward; his change of
countenance too plainly told her, that all she had guessed was true.
 </p><p> The merchant was away but for a minute, and when he returned, his
countenance was beaming more radiently than ever; delight appeared
in every feature.
 </p><p> When Osborne perceived this, his heart sank within him. He arose,
and asked permission-" to away," as he said, "to his affairs upon the
Bridge."
 </p><p> " Not to the Bridge, boy," replied Hewet; "what is to be done
there, to-day, I myself must do, after I have given audience to Lord
Talbot. Think of that-a Cloth-worker and his wife solicited to grant
audience to a lord! Oh, money, money ! get money, boy, and you will
have no lack of lords."
</p><p>  " Not if you've a lovely daughter too," whispered the Bridge-shooter
into the ear of Flora.
 </p><p> "But come, astir, astir," said the merchant, " for we all have our
work to do."  A great clattering of horses' feet was now heard in the
court-yard.  "Come, Willy-of-the-Bridge, mount, and away to your
fortune, man; or mount and away with your fortune, I should say, for I
believe Eoline, in your eyes, is the only fortune, you will deign to look
upon as fortune. The Bridge-shooter will with you. Flora must remain
with my spouse here, for she must be well attired to receive so great a
personage as Shrewsbury's young heir.
 </p><p> " But who then," said Edward, " is to accompany your daughter to
the Heath ?"
 </p><p> "Who !" exclaimed Hewet, "why, who is there but you ?"
 </p><p> " I !" ejaculated Osborne.
  "You! yes, you," replied the merchant; "is there anything so
wondrous strange in such an arrangement, that you needs must stare
your eyes out ? It is not the first time you have protected Anne by some
hundreds, is it ?"
  </p><p>"Perhaps," joined in Flora, maliciously, "perhaps Edward would
rather Master Walter Lerue escorted her."
 </p><p> "There is no Master Lerue," said Edward almost savagely. "But am
I to take Anne to the Heath alone ?-and when do you follow ?"
 </p><p> " Oh," replied Hewet, "to-morrow, or next day, or the day after
that, or, in fact, as soon as we can get away. But do not be afraid of
remaining there alone-the Heath is safe enough now; we shall hear no
more of robbers."
 </p><p> " I am no coward, master, I fear not robbers," said Edward, rather
piqued; "I never trembled, even when surrounded by them-but-I--"
 </p><p> "Yes, dear, quite ready," exclaimed the merchant, turning from
Edward, and going towards the door, through which Alyce and Eoline
had a short time before gone out.







                                            <pb id="p.369" n="369"/>

  </p><p>What annoyed Osborne dreadfully, was to see Flora and the Bridge-
shooter laughing in a corner; he felt convinced that he formed the subject
of their mirth-but why ? they knew not the secret of his heart, at least
he thought so.
 </p><p> Flora having adjusted a warm kind of wrapper round William's throat,
now came to Osborne, and with a very grave face, said softly to him,
" Now mind, Edward, that you are a good boy; don't let your violentflow
of spirits, and well-known gallantry, o'erleap discretion; fortunately
Anne is very ugly, and you are about the same, so perhaps my warning is
uncalled for: if you should find any lack of subjects to converse on during
these long evenings, turn to that most interesting of all games for two-
scratch-cradle, you'll find it very agreeable, I can assure you; the only
difficulty is, in avoiding your own fingers coming in contact with those of
your opponent. I have known two hands get so entangled through that
game, that they have never been again disunited until death; so be on your
guard not to entangle your fingers with those of Anne Hewet, or you
may rue it." Having said this, she gave him two or three knowing
nods of the head, and walked away.
 </p><p> So full was his mind of the strangeness of the situation he suddenly
found himself in, that he scarcely comprehended what Flora was talking
about; and had he wished to have replied, he would have been prevented,
for the reality of his unlooked-for position was now made manifest by the
lovely girl entering with her mother. Anne was equipped for her journey
in cloaks and furs, whose costliness evinced the high respectability of the
wearer; for, as we have before observed, fur, in those days, was a distinguishing mark, the different kinds being appropriated to the various
classes of society. Mona would have accompanied them to the Heath,
but one of the merchant's ships being about to sail for Italy, it was
thought advisable for her to remain in safety where she then was, until the
moment arrived when she might leave these shores for ever, and return
to her native land.
 </p><p> If Edward Osborne had puzzled his brain for a whole month to have
invented a most perplexing position for himself to be placed in, he could
not have conceived one half so embarrassing as that in which he soon
found himself. Not an hour before, and he had been congratulating himself upon the almost certainty of being enabled to fly without even the
pain of bidding her farewell, when, all at once, as if by magic, here he
found himself, not only in her presence, but, as it were, actually shut
up alone with her in a little box; for the weather being still cold, and
Anne, remaining still an invalid, all the windows of the cabin of the
barge were closed, as well as the front doors.
 </p><p> It was quite astonishing to observe the altered conduct of each to the
other, since each had discovered their own new turn of feeling.  It is
true that Flora had endeavoured to open the eyes of Anne to Osborne's
passion, but if Anne had doubted what she heard when Flora spoke,
her doubt was doubt no longer, for Edward never once even raised his
eyes to hers, indeed, he seemed studiously to avoid such a presumptuous
act.  Had they been placed in such a position but one little month
before, and these two had been the happiest, the gayest of human beings;
but now they sat motionless, speechless and all because each loved the







<pb id="p.370" n="370"/>                  .

other to desperation, but dared not reveal that love, fearful, nay, certain,
it would find no reflex in the other's heart.
  </p><p> They remained so long silent, that silence became quite painful,
Anne, at last, said very gently--" Edward, I wish you could adjust this
cushion for me in some way more easy for my head."
 </p><p>  Osborne quite started at the sudden appeal-  Certainly, dear Anne,"
he replied, as he hastened to fulfil her wishes; " that will, I think, be
much more comfortable."
  </p><p> Not a word more was spoken, and Edward resumed his seat; after
another prolonged fit of quietude, Anne exclaimed-" You have made me
more uneasy than ever."
 </p><p>  " I'm sorry for that, Anne," he replied, as he again placed, and replaced, and altered, and re-altered, the position of every cushion that
had been arranged for Anne's greater comfort.
 </p><p>  One, she said, was too high, another was too low, this was too hard,
that was too soft. " Oh dear, oh dear," she exclaimed at last, " you
must think me very fretful, and so I am, and I have been so for a long
time; but it is very ungrateful of me to let such trifles annoy and worry
me, as I do now; I used not to be so wayward-used I, Edward ?"
 </p><p>  Edward made quite a long speech, denying that he had ever found
her so; nor did he think her so at that moment.
 </p><p> " You were always kind to little Anne, Edward," she said, looking at
him most affectionately; this was the first time their eyes had met, since
they had been in the barge alone, and why, no one can tell, but they
both felt very awkward; and both once more became silent.
 </p><p> Presently Anne began to rub one hand with the other, and said-
"Notwithstanding all these furs, and I am sure we are shut in closely
enough to keep me warm, yet my hands are as cold as ice-just feel this
one, Edward-did you ever feel anything so cold ? Why, Edward," she
said, quite anxiously, "your hands are in a perfect fever-they are
burning."
 </p><p> "The better to warm yours, dear Anne," he replied, as he placed
her hands between his own: as he gently rubbed them, which Anne
said, "made her feel much more comfortable," his fingers passed
accidentally between hers; he coloured up, for at that moment, Flora's
remark about the danger of fingers becoming entangled, crossed his
mind; he heaved an inward sigh, and thought, " would to heaven that
these could become, from this entanglement, so united that they should
never separate but in death !"  It struck him as very remarkable, that
until that moment, he had never noticed the extreme beauty of Anne's
hand; how he longed to kiss it, and he felt that formerly he should have
done so, and neither would have thought it strange, but now he dared not.
 </p><p> The warmer the beautiful girl's hands were made, the more fluent
became their tongues, and a very long time was passed over by Anne
relating, very minutely, all that she was aware of, as having happened
to her, after she had left the cottage on the night of the robbery. He
listened with intense interest to all she said; but when she came to
relate that part, where she had attempted to escape by climbing to the
gallery, he held his breath from sheer anxiety; and just as Anne was
describing her falling backwards to the ground, a dreadful shock came







                                         <pb id="p.371" n="371"/>

ttgainst the barge, which threw her completely into his arms; she was
too much alarmed to feel that he had pressed her, though gently, to his
heart; in an instant she had recovered her former position, and Edward
hurried out of the cabin to enquire the cause of the shock. It was a
mere nothing; some idle boys, not understanding the rowers' art, had
run foul of the merchant's barge, but had done no mischief.
  </p><p>Poor Edward, when he returned, longed to have renewed his former
happy labour, but could not muster courage to attempt it, until Anne
said-" You must now, Edward, unless you are tired, rub my other hand,
as you did this."
 </p><p> Osborne felt that all this was but a bad way of carrying out his resolve
to leave and forget Anne as speedily as possible; but his reason, as it
does in almost all such cases, gave way to his desires. It now became
his turn to carry on the truthful romance by recounting all the anxieties
caused by her disappearance, and all their endeavours to recover her.
So much interest did his fair companion appear to feel in all he said,
and so many kind looks did she cast upon the narrator, that Osborne
felt inspired, and dilated so largely upon every point, that just as he had
arrived at the moment of his placing her in her mother's longing arms,
the barge stopped, and they found themselves at Putney.
 </p><p> As they walked towards the Heath, their minds, unknown to each
other, turned upon exactly the like reflection, namely, that how often
had they before taken the self-same walk, but with what different
feelings to those they experienced now. Osborne, finding no excuse for
holding his sweet companion's hand as they walked along, seemed to
have lost the charm that had inspired him, and indeed her too, for
they spoke very little for the rest of their walk, and what they did say
was of no interest to be repeated.
 </p><p> When they reached the cottage, the first thing Anne did was to
hasten to her old friend, the old man of the show.
 </p><p> While she was with him, Osborne sat musing over the fire, and
murmured to himself-" Well, he who would not be killed by slow
poison, should cease to take the drug, however delicious to the sense
it be, when once he knows its deadly power; the smallest dose will do
if long continued; better then at once to dash to pieces the tempting
phial, and thus disperse the baneful influence it surrounds, than treasure
an enemy so subtle, merely because it gives a pleasure to the eye to
gaze upon the beauties of the vessel in which it lies. Oh, I have taken
a fuller dose to-day of that fell poison of my heart-fuller than any yet;
my heart feels overflowing with the resistless intoxicating fluid; my
only escape lies in instant flight. The merchant will be here to-morrow
at least I pray so, and then-but he must be mad to have acted thus
Does not he know that his daughter's fair ? does he forget that I have
eyes. If he do know, as know he must, how little danger there is for
her, it still is cruelty to me, cruelty to place me thus so near a shrine he
knows I dare not kneel to, yet before which he cannot but be sure that
I, as well as all mankind, would think it bliss to offer up a heart-to
sacrifice a life! But why should he think all this ? If I thought it not
till now, why should he now think it ? No! I am the madman ,not
he! Had I been open to him and told him the truth, he would have







<pb id="p.372" n="372"/>                    .

applauded my resolution-have quicker aided me in my flight, and
would not thus have added another link to the chain which binds my
heart to her-would I could say to her's; but no, for then I feel the
chain could never have been sundered."
 </p><p>  It was a great relief to Osborne when Anne returned, to see the old
 man with her, and to learn that he would remain all the evening, and
 tell them all that had passed, and of the strange discovery he had made
 concerning his brother; for although it was not yet made quite manifest, yet there was but little doubt remaining of the truth.
 </p><p>  Thus, then, the first dreaded evening passed over with tolerable safety
 to Osborne, at least he flattered himself so; for he said to himself-
 " we have scarcely exchanged one word," but he forgot how often the
 poison of the heart is taken through the eyes; and that night his eyes
 devoured enough to have destroyed a thousand hearts-poor Osborne!
</p><p>   We must now take the reader to a very different scene.
</p><p>   It may be remembered that on one particular night the Cripple, who
had taken refuge in the ruined dwelling over the Black Arch of the Clink,
had witnessed an awful scene of four wretches bearing the murdered
body of Ray the Clipper, into one of the other two houses near at hand;
and it may also be remembered that Spikely had intimated that the
body should be buried in the vault beneath the street; into this vault
we will now lead the reader.
  </p><p> Just over the spot where the body had been interred, Horton was
sitting upon some damp straw; his legs were tied together, and fastened
to the opposite wall in such a manner as to prevent him drawing them
up; his body was fastened by a chain that passed round his chest, just
below his armpits, thus rendering it impossible, although his hands
were at liberty, for him to reach his ancles to loosen the cords that bound
his feet together.
</p><p>  Soon after he had left the court of justice, he had been waylaid by
some of Spikely's ruffians, and had been brought to the miserable hole
in which he now was confined.
</p><p>   The first system pursued by Spikely to torture the unfortunate wretch,
was to introduce himself quietly into the vault while it was in total
darkness, and then to work upon the other's fears, by speaking as though
from the grave, for Horton was not even yet aware of Spikely's escape
from death.
  </p><p>It may easily be imagined the horror which took possession of Horton's -
mind, when first he heard the well-known voice of him, he believed he had
murdered. Not only did the other speak of his own untimely death, but
brought vividly before the now-almost phrenzied imagination of his victim,
every circumstance attending the murder of Sir Filbut in the wood-"He
sends you this," said the awful voice, " in token of his gratitude: use it
upon thyself, murderer, and farewell until we meet, where parting we
never more shall know."
 </p><p> Horton now heard something fall by his side. A cold perspiration
burst from every pore; he listened until his ears seemed pained by the
awful silence, which refused to satisfy their craving for some sound; all
was still-still and dark, as the grave. Such horrid pictures did his
fancy now portray, that they drove him to the brink of madness; he







                                        <pb id="p.373" n="373"/>

raved and screamed for help; for some time not a sound was heard; at
last a ray of light came through a chink in the door, that seemed to him
as a ray from heaven.
 </p><p> The door opened, and the gigantic ruffian, known before as Bludgeon
Billy, stood in the way, holding a lamp-" What the devil ails you ?
exclaimed the ruffian; "have you seen a ghost, that you shiver and
shake so ?"
 </p><p> "No," replied Horton, "but if ever a voice came from hell to torture
a being of earth, that voice I have heard but now."
 </p><p> " What are you staring at ?" said the other, as Horton riveted his
eyes upon something lying close beside him; he answered not, but kept
his gaze still rooted, as it were, upon the object of his fear: it was his
own dagger, the one with which he knew he had slain Sir Filbut, but
which he believed had been for years buried beneath the flood.  Before
he had power to speak, he heard a horrid laugh come from the next
vault, and in another moment Spikely stood before him.
 </p><p> Horton at once saw that he had been duped-that by some
strange chance, unaccountable to him, Spikely had escaped the intended
doom.
 </p><p> " Have you no kind word," said Spikely, sneeringly, "no burst of joy
to welcome an old friend? but absent friends are soon, by some, forgotten-but not by me. No, no, friend Horton; I owe you a heavy
debt, and would have sought you round the globe, rather than not repay
you, ay, and with my own hand too ! Do you not remember our last
meeting? It made such an impression on me," he said, pointing to a
deep scar in his throat, " that while this remains, my obligation to good
Harry Horton can never be forgotten."
 </p><p> " You mean to murder me ?" said Horton, trembling.
 </p><p> "That may depend upon yourself, mayhap, or, perhaps, upon my
humour; but if you are to die by these hands, that dagger shall be the
weapon; you know how well it does its work. But first, there is one
upon whom I have sworn to be revenged, more deeply sworn than I have
sworn to be revenged on you; you must help me in the matter; and
upon your willingness to serve me, may depend your own fate, which
you must now feel lies within these hands. You know to whom I
allude. She baffles me still, although I know her hiding-place. 'Tis
you must draw her forth.   Here are the necessary implements for
writing; write what I shall dictate; she will never doubt her beloved
nephew, and will walk into the trap as unconsciously as a mouse."
</p><p>  Horton, who never cared much about sacrificing any one, if, by doing
so, he served himself, made no hesitation to Write whatever Spikely
desired.
 </p><p>  The purport of the letter was to pray of Nan to meet Horton that
night at the Cardinal's Hat, and so artfully and temptingly worded,
that Spikely chuckled again when it was finished, to think how certain
he now was of his long-sought revenge.
 </p><p>  Horton having done all that Spikely had commanded, most abjectly prayed for his life; but to all his prayers, his oaths of sorrow
for the past, his promises of high reward-for he declared that he knew
of a store of valuables that still remained secreted, belonging to the







<pb id="p.374" n="374"/>                   .
murdered knight-to all this Spikely would make no positive reply,
but merely muttered--" We shall see, we shall see; but first let me
fulfil my oath to Nan, and then your turn shall come. Farewell !"
 </p><p> Spikely turned upon his heel, and followed by Bludgeon Billy, with
the lamp, left Horton to his own miserable reflections. He heard the
door bolted securely; but had it been left wide open, it had been the
same to him, bound as he was. He gave himself up to despair, for
lie knew his enemy's unrelenting temper too well to hope for mercy.
He made a desperate effort to loosen the chain that bound him, but the
effort proved abortive; he felt about the wall behind him-the bricks were
old and rotten-had he some tool, with which to work upon them, then
it seemed yet possible that he might still release himself from the chain:
his only hope now lay in the dagger- a strange hope for him.
 </p><p>  The reader will, doubtless, wonder how that weapon, once again, came
into the possession of Spikely, but the chance was very simple. When
the fire upon the Bridge became known to the "Bishop's Birds," numbers
of them flew to their boats to pick up what they might. When the upper
portion of the merchant's dwelling fell into the stream, many valuable
things floated about in all directions; these were quickly picked up by
the " Birds," and it was in one of Osborne's writing-cases, which had
fallen into their hands, that the dagger had been found, and it was only
just before Spikely had paid his ghost-like visit to Horton, that it had
fallen under his notice; the moment he saw it, he determined to use it
as we have seen he did; but he little thought in giving Horton that
dagger, he was bestowing upon him the means to escape his vengeance;
but so it proved.
 </p><p>  The instant Horton had formed the notion of a way to escape, he felt
 about the ground in the direction in which he knew the dagger lay; he
 could not resist a shudder as his hand touched it; but all sensitiveness
 was then, to him, out of place, so seizing it firmly, he turned as well as
 he could towards the wall, and set to work. It was but a slow process,
 for as he scraped away the bricks around the heavy iron staple, the
 inner portion he soon found was of firmer texture; but still the progress
 he made held forth a hope-his only hope, and brought him courage to
 persevere. After some hours of unceasing labour, to his unspeakable joy,
 the staple suddenly gave way; the chain was now removed from around
 his breast, and, with the aid of the sharp edge of the dagger, the cords
 that bound his feet were soon cut asunder. He stood erect, and felt as
 if already free; but his greatest labour was still to come. He had
 guessed, and guessed rightly, from so plainly hearing every footfall that
 passed from the house into the street above, that the crown of the vault
 was close beneath the upper surface of the road. The only chance of
 escape lay in his powers, by the aid of the dagger, which had already
 worked so well in his cause, to scrape away the mouldering mortar
 between the bricks of the arch, and thus remove a sufficient number of
 them to form an aperture large enough for him to force his body through;
 even this he succeeded in accomplishing, but not until many a weary
 hour had come and gone: as the loosened bricks fell in, he perceived it was
 already break of day; he collected all the rubbish he could find; fortunately
 for him there lay an old trunk in one corner, it was but a small one, yet







                 <pb id="p.375" n="375"/>

by placing it upon the little mound he had raised, he found it sufficiently
elevated to enable him to gain a firm resting for his arms upon the road
above; by great bodily exertion he at last succeeded in lifting himself,
and eventually in reaching the surface.
 </p><p>While he was thus employed, the agony he suffered, fearing that some
of the ruffians might come past, and annihilate every hope, was almost
worse than the certainty of death. Upon finding himself really free, his
first thought was to hasten to Nan, and warn her of the plan laid for
her destruction; he had a double motive in this, for he knew that with
her he should be safer than elsewhere, for he imagined that Spikely,
upon discovering his escape, would be sure he had flown to Nan to warn
her, and that, therefore, her old dwelling would be the last place where
it would be likely now to find her. He hastened from the Clink, and we
will now leave him on his road to Nan's abode.
 </p><p> Fate seemed to have armed herself against Edward Osborne; at every
turn, there she stood to oppose him, do what he would, or rather attempt what he would, for she appeared determined he should do nothing
but what she liked. His plan was to have flown the enchantment
of Anne's charms-fate placed him closer within their spell; he sought
every opportunity to avoid her presence-fate invented new opportunities for continually placing her near him.
 </p><p> " Well," thought Osborne, when he rose the next morning, after
arriving at the Heath, " the merchant will, no doubt, come to-day, and
until he do, I will manage that the old man shall be Anne's companion, so that I can remain in my own apartment."
 </p><p> Now it so happened that fate had determined just the contrary, for,
very early in the day, a messenger arrived with two letters from the
merchant-one for Osborne, telling him not to expect his master until
he saw him, for a circumstance had occurred of such moment, that it
was absolutely necessary he should remain in London, for how long, he
could not at that instant say; he might be at the Heath the next day,
or he might not be there for a week; at all events he would write again
the next morning, and not only acquaint Osborne with the extraordinary
circumstance alluded to, but also what he wished and expected Edward
to do in the business. There was one sentence, inserted by the express
desire of Alyce, which terribly troubled Edward, and that was, " That
being so alarmed for the safety of her child, Osborne was not to lose
sight of her for a single moment that it was possible for him to be near
her. The other letter was to the old man, now addressed as Wilfred
Mortley, desiring him to hasten to London as speedily as possible, thus
taking away the only stay Edward felt he had to fall back upon.
 </p><p> Osborne proposed accompanying the old man as far as the Ferry; but
then the injunction " not to quit his precious charge for a single moment," came across his mind, so that if he went, Anne must go too; and
so she did, and Edward then determined, however painful it might prove
to him, to do his duty, and to act up to the strict letter of his instructions; therefore not one instant of that day did he quit her presence;
and when the day was ended, he was astonished to find how quickly it
had passed, and how much happier he had been than he could possibly
have expected--" Happy, happy, indeed," he said, " would such a life








<pb id="p.376" n="376"/>

as this be, blessed by mutual love; but such happiness is not for Edward Osborne. If I were as vain as some men, what might my vanity
not lead me to hope for ? More than once to-night, while I was reading to her, I fancied I saw her gazing at me with a fixed expression, very
different to that of former times; there was a sadness, but a kindness
in her look, that to one who dared have hope; but no, no, I dare not!
Had she been poor, then might my motives not have been misunderstood; but as it is, I would not have her love me, no, not for worlds !"
 </p><p>  It is astonishing, in almost every action of life, how habit softens
down the sharp and rugged points, that at first sight cause us dread.
He who is surrounded by continual dangers, in time will gaze on danger,
and scarcely know it bears that name; so, to a degree, found Edward
Osborne, for even on the second morning, instead of feeling dread at meeting Anne, he thought the day broke very slowly, and when it did, it
was quite astonishing how quickly he performed his toilet, and yet,
perhaps, he never did so with more care. He was down in the lower
room, very busy putting on fresh logs to the fire-moving and removing
every bit of the breakfast, which, as we have before said, was rather a
substantial meal; this he was doing, to render it more tempting to the
eye; and then he suddenly ran off to the farm, to scold them for having
forgotten the eggs-" things," that he declared, " every one at the farm
knew, as well as he did, how agreeable they were to their young mistress." And then he arranged them himself in a very pretty, tasty flat
basket, with moss and some winter flowers; and then when he returned
with them, he went and passed his hand over every crevice of the window, to feel that no air would come in just at the back of Anne's seat.
And then he began to think Anne was a long time coming, and that
he had better have the hour announced to her-" But I suppose, poor
girl, she was fatigued with our walking so much yesterday, so a little
rest will do no harm." Having made up his mind to this, he sat down,
and exerted his patience to the utmost. At last her foot was heard.
One bound, and he was at the door to open it for her; and now it was
discovered, that, notwithstanding the laziness he accused her of, she had
come down exactly one hour before her usual time. So much more at
ease did he become this day, that long before noon, he said to Anne
-" Dear Anne, I trust your father will not put himself out of the way
to hurry down on your account; indeed, I almost think I had better
write, and tell him  -"
   </p><p>"Tell him what, Edward ?"
   </p><p>" Why, that how safe you are, and how well you are, and how happy
you are, and that as long as there is the slightest necessity for your
father's presence in town, that I shall-or you will- you know I shall
say all that sort of thing."
   </p><p>Anne, not exactly comprehending the sort of thing he would say,
thought it better to wait the promised communication from her father.
Now it was very strange, that, from that moment until they were retiring for the night, it never struck them  once that the communication
had not arrived.  What they could both have been thinking of; or talking of, so completely to have forgotten the circumstance, was very odd;
but forget it they most assuredly did.






                      <pb id="p.377" n="377"/>
 </p><p> There was one subject upon which Anne had been talking, during
their long rambles of that day, which brought poor Edward down from
the airy castles he for a moment had been building, and made him view
his unhappy state in the most wretched light, and that was by her having entered upon the subject of the misery that must spring from young
girls being thought wealthy.-" In such a case," she said, " how can she
ever believe in the unselfish offer of man's love ?  That is the one great
reason which will ever keep me from wedding. I would be loved for
myself, not for my gold. But rich as my father is known to be, how
could I ever be sure that no unworthy motive prompted the seeming
affection offered me? How could I ever be convinced that I was not
deceived ? Oh, would that I were poor!"
 </p><p> " Would that you were," thought Edward, " and that I were rich !"
 </p><p> Now selfish as this wish appears, it was the offspring of a purely unselfish feeling, for in his mind, at that moment, he was picturing to him
self with what rapture would he have flung his heart and all his wealth
at her dear feet!
 </p><p> Their constant contiguity was causing dreadful havock in both their
hearts. Now when Anne placed her arm through his as they strolled
about the Heath, it was done with that sweet dependence which tells
of love, though with a silent tongue; and then would Edward, still as
unconscious as herself of what he did, press that arm much closer
to his side than he was wont to do; but so gradually, so imperceptibly had this mutual change of their manners to each other grown
upon them, that when on visiting the grave of poor Lillia, Anne wept,
and rested her head on Edward's breast, and Edward kissed a tear from
off her cheek, neither he nor she felt there was any thing extraordinary
in that kindliness of feeling. They read much less that evening, and
talked much more; and although Edward wished, or fancied he wished,
to speak about his intended exile, somehow or other he could not muster
up courage to do so, for he began to fancy it might give Anne pain.
  Not long before they were about to part for the night, Anne said
-" By-the-by, Edward, there is one line in the note dear mother sent
me enclosed in yours, that I cannot for my life make out-I wish you
would try."
</p><p> We wonder, at that moment, what Edward would not have done to
have pleased the lovely girl who sat before him; so, of course, he assented; and Anne, taking from her bosom a carefully-folded paper,
placed it in Osborne's hand. He had not half undone it, before, not
only he, but she also, discovered it to be his own " Dream of love."  He
looked to Anne inquiringly, and saw her face in a perfect flame-" Good
Heavens, Anne !" he exclaimed, " how could this have come into your
possession ?"
 </p><p> Poor Anne felt like a culprit suddenly detected. If her face just before
had been in a flame, it was so no longer; shame had quenched the fire, and
left naught but the pale ashes there.-" Oh," replied the confused girl, endeavouring to answer quite unconcernedly, " it was Flora gave it to me;
she said it was some waste paper you had thrown aside; but thinking I
should like the lines, she brought them to me."
 </p><p> "And do you like them, Anne ?" inquired Osborne.








<pb id="p.378" n="378"/>                    .

  </p><p>Otherwise I had not kept them," was her reply.
 </p><p> "But they are half obliterated," and Edward again looked upon the
paper.
 </p><p> Anne felt the colour again rising to her face, for she too well remembered the tears she had shed on the night she had first beheld them.
</p><p>  Edward offered to copy them afresh; but Anne replied-" They
would do very well for her;" and then carelessly, so she intended it to
appear, took them again, but now placed them in the silken purse, which
hung from her side, and giving Edward her mother's note, escaped, as
speedily as might be, to the seclusion of her own room.
 </p><p>  They both experienced that night a strange bewilderment of feeling-
a kind of happiness they had never felt before. Peace be upon their
slumbers, nor let them dream of the dreadful storm that shall break over
them, before the sun again shall set!
  </p><p> Never was a more lovely morning seen than that which followed the
night we have just past over. The air, though sharp, was clear and exhilarating, and the sun, as he smiled on all around, seemed greatly to
cheer, if not prodigiously to warm all nature in its earliest spring.
</p><p>   As they had not received any further news from London, both Anne
and Edward determined to spend that morning in writing very long letters, one to the merchant, the other to her mother. Edward was quite
astonished at the happy vein that ran through the whole of his lengthy
epistle.
  </p><p> When they had ended their labour, they were about to prepare for a
journey to the letter-carrier at the Ferry, when who should arrive but
the old man. His face was so brimful of joy, that they felt sure that
the news he brought was of a happy nature.
 </p><p>  " Yes, yes, my children," said the old man, as they led him to the
most comfortable of all the easy seats, " my news is indeed of a happy.
nature, and of a nature to make us all thrice happy, for it concerns my
little Anne !"
 </p><p>  " But of your own affairs, grandfather," said Anne, for she still always called him by that endearing name " what fortune has befallen'
 you, good or bad ?"
 </p><p>  " Too good for my deserts," said the old man, " too good, far too
 good. There is no longer doubt of Algernon Mortley being my long-
 lost brother; and although all is not yet quite settled, 'tis next to certain, that the old beggar you purchased, your willing slave of the iron
 ring, will yet be a wealthy man."
  </p><p> " Oh, that is happy news indeed!" said Anne. " And how is my
 dear mother, and my no less dear father, and Flora, and all ? And when
 are they to be here ? and-"
</p><p>   " Stop, stop, child," ejaculated the old man, smiling; " you forget that
 the memory of age is not so capacious as that of youth: why, I shall
 have forgotten your first question, before you reach your last, if you run
 on at that rate. First then, your mother and her spouse are happy beyond expression, and would have written all their happiness down in
 black and white, had I not craved to have a little share in their happiness, by being their mouthpiece to tell you all that has happened."







              <pb id="p.379" n="379"/>

 </p><p> "Then tell us quickly, grandfather!" exclaimed Anne, " for good
news cannot come too quickly."
 </p><p> " Oh, 'twill make your little heart dance for joy," replied the old man;
but you must not let your delight rob you of your reason; so keep a
fast hold of your sober senses, while I tell you. Well then, you must
know-yes, you must know that when Lord Talbot--Why, Edward,
what ails you, boy ?"
 </p><p> " Oh, nothing, nothing," replied Osborne, looking deadly pale, for the
name of Talbot seemed now to turn his blood to ice.
 </p><p> " Well then," continued the old man, " when Lord Talbot came-
Now I'll defy either of you, clever as you, no doubt, think yourselves,
to guess what his lordship came for ?"
</p><p>  Edward merely groaned inwardly; and Anne innocently shook her
head.
 </p><p> " Oh, you puss, you puss !" said the old man, pretending to box both
the ears of the lovely girl; " it is a lucky thing for mankind, that you
have been kept as secluded as you have, or you would have had terrible
things to have answered for."
 </p><p> " But, grandfather, dear," said Anne, " what can I have to do with
all this ?"
 </p><p> " You have every thing to do with it; for know that young Lord
Talbot, the handsome Lord George, the heir to the earldom of Shrewsbury, has formally demanded your hand in marriage !"
 </p><p> Anne screamed outright, and would have fallen to the ground, had
not Edward sprang forward, and caught her in his arms.-" It has come
at last !" he exclaimed, " the dreaded hour is come! Would to Heaven
the earth could open at this instant, and swallow me up in death!"
 </p><p>  " What means this madness ?" said the old man. "Why, Edward,
Edward, surely you too do not love her ?"
   </p><p>" Love her !" exclaimed Edward, pressing the weeping girl closer and
closer to his heart, " love is a word too weak, to paint one tythe of that
deep soul-absorbing adoration, that fills my heart for her! I know that
what I feel is madness-that what I say is senseless raving, and I feel
now that I could tear out my tongue, for having thus betrayed me !
Up to this moment, I have kept my secret closely sealed within my
breast; I would not wrong the being I loved, by even disclosing to her my
hopeless passion, fearing that pity for my sufferings might have moved
her to forget herself. Surprise has wrung from me that which no mortal torture should have caused me to confess ! 'Tis useless now to deny
my love; but I will prove its proud sincerity! This moment shall see
me fly from all that could render life endurable! Farewell, dear, dear,
dear Anne, farewell!"
  </p><p> " Edward, Edward," Anne exclaimed, clinging to him, " do not leave
me thus! you know not-cannot know how dearly--"
  </p><p> " Hush, child," said the old man, gently placing himself between
them, as he loosened her arms from Edward's neck, and softly placed
her, weeping, on the couch. Then turning to Edward, who seemed stupified with grief, he said kindly-" You love her, do you not ?  But do
not answer-I know you do; then by that love, I command you leave
her; she knows not what she says, and now might utter words, that






<pb id="p.380" n="380"/>

afterwards might cause repentance. Be, for this time, advised by age-
but quit not this house-I mean not now; go to your room-I will soon
follow, and then my advice, though perhaps not worthy the taking,
shall be at least sincere."
 </p><p> Edward did not speak; but taking the old man's hand between both
of his, pressed it fervently. He made a movement, as if to approach
the weeping girl; but the old man gently forced him back. He gave
one last look of intense love towards Anne, and burst from the apartment.
 </p><p> When he was gone, the old man approached Anne, and seating himself by her side, took her hand kindly in his own.-" Child," he said,
" many a year has now passed by, since, once upon a summer's eve, an
old man sat by a weeping child, her hand in his, as yours is now in
mine, and the old man tried to dry the tears of that weeping child. Do
you remember a picture of the kind ?"
</p><p>  Anne turned her eyes towards the old man, and sadly smiling through
a veil of tears, threw her arms fondly around his neck.
 </p><p> " I feel you do," he said, as he pressed her affectionately to his heart.
"Well then, Anne, if that same child be weeping now, the same old
man is by to comfort her; he brought her hope before, and why may he
not try to do so now ?"
 </p><p> " There is no hope, grandfather, there is no hope !" said Anne, sobbing
bitterly; " for would my father's pride allow him to refuse, he would
not have the courage to deny a suitor of such power."
 </p><p> " Your father has courage to do his will, depend on that. But why this
strong, this sudden burst of anguish ? Lord Talbot is handsome, talented,
and great."
</p><p>  " Were all his beauties, talents, or his greatness, augmented tenfold,
and tenfold that again, I would not have him."
 </p><p> "But wherein lies your powerful objection ?" enquired the old man;
"in my eyes he has no fault."
 </p><p> "In mine," said Anne, " he has all faults in one-his wish to wed
me."
</p><p>  " I never knew a maiden yet," replied the old man, " who loathed a
suitor, were he ne'er so worthless, with such intenseness as you now
loath Lord Talbot, unless the little nich that lies in a woman's heart,
destined one day to hold the form of love, had secretly been usurped
or willingly filled up already; tell me then, child, and tell me with all
the candour you used to speak your mind in our olden times-is not
that little nich within your heart already filled ?"
 </p><p> " It is," said Anne, looking the old man full in the face, " and Edward's is the form I have placed there. Oh, grandfather," she continued, again losing the little firmness she had for an instant assumed,
" I knew not until I thought we were to part, how dearly, how madly
I have loved him. Nor did I know his love for me till now. He knows
not yet of mine, nor would I have him know it; but you must save me
from despair. I want not to wed with any. All I would pray is, that
I may not be forced to give my hand to one, while my heart is given to
another."
  </p><p>The old man promised to see her father again, and " little doubted,"




                      <pb id="p.381" n="381"/>

he said, " that much as he knew the merchant had set his heart upon
the aggrandizement of his child, he might yet persuade him to find some
means to avoid the promised union." Having relieved her mind to a
degree upon this point, the old man ascended to Osborne's room.
  </p><p> We will not relate all the arguments the old man used to convince
Edward how foolish he had been in giving way to a passion so hopeless;
but we cannot resist stating that he did this in a way that must appear to
our readers the very opposite course to that which he ought to have pursued, for notwithstanding the caution given him by Anne, he told
Osborne all that had passed between them.
 </p><p>  " Now you know, Edward, you know the unfortunate passion you
have raised in her breast, you must see how necessary it is, if but for
her peace of mind, that you immediately quit this place, and for ever."
 </p><p>  Notwithstanding the dread necessity implied by the last words of the
old man, Edward could not but feel a proud joy spring up in his heart,
as he heard of Anne's confession of love for him; but he also felt that
such confession rendered the task of leaving her doubly agonizing.
 </p><p>  The old man now acquainted Osborne with his promise to Anne, of
again seeing the merchant, and said-" And now, boy, as this will probably be the last evening you will ever pass with poor Anne, I need not
tell you to be kind to her; nor that the greatest act of kindness on your
part, will lie in not speaking of love. But above all things, I charge you,
drop not a hint that I have disclosed to you her secret."
 </p><p>  Not long after this, and the old man might be seen trudging along on
his promised journey to London. How far Osborne obeyed the old man's
injunctions we know not; nor do we know whether Edward told Anne, or
Anne told Edward of her affection for him; nor indeed do we know, or
if we do, we will not tell, what sighs and tears-what hope and fears
were mutually exchanged; but this we do know, and this we may tell,
that after passing through many a year of a long life, Edward always
declared that that night was the most miserably happy of his whole
existence.</p></div1>

</p><p>WHEN Horton reached Nan's abode it was broad day; but, although
comparatively only a few hours had elapsed since he had been compelled
to write to her, he still found he had arrived too late to warn her. He
here learnt, that after the night had somewhat advanced, a lad had been
there, coming, as he said, "from Master Horton to Widow Spikely;"
he had brought a letter, which caused the dame to don her walking
gear, and had then, although so late, quitted the place with the lad.
 </p><p> " Then she is lost," said Horton to himself; as he turned away;






<pb id="p.382" n="382"/>                   .
" the fiends have caught her in their trap; the next will be set for me,
which they will take good care shall be a closer one than even that from
which I have escaped. I must fly this land, for Spikely will never rest
again till I am hunted down."
 </p><p>  How little would he have had to dread in that quarter, had he known
all; but we must not anticipate. He passed up Chancery Lane, and
strolled about the distant fields the whole of the early part of that day
devising plans, not only for his own safety, but to draw down vengeance
upon the heads of all his foes.
 </p><p>  We will now look back, and casting a retrospective glance into
the remaining portion of the Cardinal's Hat, see what strange things
happened there.
 </p><p> "I think we shall nab her now," said Spikely to Brassinjaw, as they
sat gloomily opposite each other in the lower room. Brassinjaw made
no answer. " Why don't you speak, you winking owl ? Aid me with
nand and heart in this, or may be, we two may have a slight account to
settle, that will leave no balance in your favour."
</p><p>  I have spoken 'til I'm tired," said Brassinjaw, doggedly, " I have
spoken, and what's the good; I tell you I never did relish murder, even
when it would have served myself; and I see no fun in putting a rope
round ones own neck merely to please another."
</p><p>  " Who said I meant to murder her ?" exclaimed Spikely.
  </p><p>" Why you," replied the other, " in act, if not in words; have you
not been into the next room a dozen times, pulling and tugging at the
ope that opens yonder trap; and is that not telling me what you would
be at ? But, by all the saints, I swear  "  He was here interrupted
by hearing some one at the top of the stairs, that descended to where
they were, whistling a well-known air.
  </p><p>"She's caught ! by Heavens, she's caught !" exclaimed Spikely, starting
up and hurrying towards the sliding panel, which he opened, and as he
passed through, with a flickering lamp in one hand, with the other, he
menaced Brassinjaw, as he said, " Remember !"
  </p><p>The panel closed just as the door opened, and Nan entered the room.
</p><p>"'Tis late at night to see a lady," said Brassinjaw, rising with pretended
politeness; " what would you, worthy dame ?"
 </p><p> "I am summoned here," replied Nan, "by one who calls himself
Harry Horton--is he here ?"
  </p><p>"Why, now I look again, I know thee well," said Brassinjaw, not
answering her question, "the witness on the adverse side at the trial--
I remember, Dame Spikely; well then, he who expects you is already
here."
 </p><p> "He is ? then lose not a moment-shew me to him."
 </p><p> "You'll see him quite soon enough, depend upon it," said Brassinjaw;
"but since you wish it, he is in the next apartment-you can pass through
here."
  </p><p>As he placed his hand upon the panel, he hesitated, for one spark of
pity still had found a spot to hide in, in his breast; but remembering the
desperate character he had to deal with, he pushed aside the panel as he
said-" He's there !"
  </p><p>The little lamp that Spikely had taken in sent forth scarcely any








                                           <pb id="p.383" n="383"/>
light at all. Nan stopped at the opening for an instant, but she had too
long been accustomed to strange holes and comers to fear, so straightway entered.
  </p><p>The moment she had passed, the panel was violently shut from the
inner side. Nan uttered a loud shriek, as Brassinjaw imagined, upon
seeing her husband.
 </p><p> A violent struggle was made against the inner side of the panel, and
then Brassinjaw fancied he heard a horrid sound, as of some one suffering in strangulation.-" By Heavens, he'll kill her; and I shall be implicated in the murder. I'll hazard all, and call assistance."
  </p><p>Brassinjaw ran to the door; it was fastened on the outer side.
  </p><p>"Don't kick up a row," said the lad on the other side; "I shan't
unbar it 'til I'm told by Spikely."
  </p><p>" The villain!" said Brassinjaw; "then must I try my strength 'gainst
his-he shall not murder her !" He flew to the panel, he could not move
it, he began to try and burst it in, when it suddenly flew aside, and
Spikely was in the opening. Brassinjaw instinctively drew out his
knife-" You've killed her !" he exclaimed.
  "'Tis a lie !" said the other, closing the panel behind him; " I have
but given her a blow, not half so hard as those she was used to once:
'twill silence her for a time-not long, though, if she be what she was:
while she's quiet, I'll have a word or two with you, mayhap a blow,
unless you at once give me the clear half of the five hundred pounds
you would have sold me for. What, fool! I have surprised you, have
I ? Did you think to reach the merchant's unwatched by me ? Do you
suppose his serving men are all saints like himself? or that the one who
took you in, and let you out, was not a creature of my own ? he brought
me every word you uttered, and but for the chance of the fire on the
Bridge, you had learnt ere this the sort of man you had to deal with.
Your money I know you keep in yonder cupboard-give me the key!"
  </p><p>" Nor key, nor money will you have from me," replied Brassinjaw;
" nor shall you have that woman's life, if it is not gone already. Ha,
ha, ha !" continued Brassinjaw, laughing contemptuously in Spikely's
face. " Oh, you may frown, and stare your blearing eyes out of your
head before you'll frighten me! Your chest is broad, but mine is broader;
your arms are strong, but mine are stronger; your knife I know is sharp
-and bloody-bloody !" and he repeated the word, as he leant forward
to give greater force to the sound, " but mine is keener and cleaner."
 </p><p> " Hell-dog !"'exclaimed Spikely, as with his uplifted knife he sprang
upon Brassinjaw: there was now no retreating for either; the struggle was
for life or death; like two thorough-bred bull- dogs, they made no barking
in their fight, but tore each other, uttering no sound, or if they did, it was
but the low growl of fell determination : by some strange chance they each
lost the hold of their knives at the self same moment; their hands were in
an instant upon each other's throat; this seemed the last struggle for them
both; they reeled, and reeled again; and just as they were falling, the
floor passed away from beneath their feet-they sank into the roaring
waters that thundered beneath the Bridge.
  </p><p>So deadly was their grasp, that even this shock failed to make either
let go his hold. Over and over they tumbled, as they went dashing







<pb id="p.384" n="384"/>                    .

down the cataract, which at that moment was at its deepest fall: the
varied currents, as they passed through the different arches, formed
numerous eddies; into one of the wildest of these the bodies, now nearly
lifeless, had found their way, and there they spun round, and round, and
round. As death was approaching now with rapid strides, every sinew
seemed to contract, and thus their hold became more firm than ever. A
barge that had slipped its moorings in the upper stream, flew through
the Bridge, and striking against the bodies, forced them from the eddy into
the rushing stream; and on, and on again they went, but life was now
extinct.
   </p><p>The boy at the door, hearing the death-struggle, became alarmed for
nis own safety, and fled the place.
  </p><p> "Well," said the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker, about midday,
after the night of which we have just been writing, "well, I only
say, it's vastly odd, friend Catchemayde, but, so sure as I am standing
before your shop window, and chatting with you, so sure is it that
Master Brassinjaw has never opened his door yet to-day."
  </p><p> "Well, it is odd," said Catchemayde, "it is odd, but I've quite
enough of my own affairs to trouble my head with, without thinking of
other folks-heigho !"
   </p><p>" How uncommonly often, friend Catchemayde, you do sigh since you
 got married," observed the little arrow-maker.
  </p><p> " Ay," replied the other, " I begin to think that sighs are the cradle
 and coffin of love-a man sighs to get a wife, and then he sighs a plaguy
 deal more to get rid of her."
  </p><p> "Oh, talking of wives," said the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker,
 " do you know there are strange things said about Lord Talbot ? they do
 say that he is always at Merchant Hewet's; and they do say, that he
 has been, in disguise, a courting sweet Mistress Hewet; and they do say,
 that unless the moon should fall down to prevent it, which is not very
 likely, that sweet Mistress Anne will be the young lord's wife."
 </p><p>  " Poh !" observed Catchemayde, "people are always saying strange
things-they said a vast number of strange things about me before I was
married."
  </p><p> " Yes," said the other, "and a great many stranger things about
your wife, after you were. Good morning."  And the sharp-nosed little
arrow-maker was out of sight in a minute.
  </p><p> Horton, who was now, more than ever, in fear of Spikely, believing
he should be safer at some distance from London until he had matured
his plans, strolled from the fields towards the City, intending to take
the passage-boat, that ran regularly at that time, to Gravesend: as he
approached Billingsgate, he saw a vast crowd close to the water's edge;
he was not long left in doubt as to the cause, for he quickly learnt that
two bodies had just been discovered half buried in the mud.
 </p><p>  The crowd now opened to let the men pass who were bringing the
bodies up the market-place; one was lying on the other; when they
were laid upon one of the counters in the market, and some of the mud
removed, it was discovered that the hands of each were on the other's
throat. Horton was close by, and as some one took some water and
washed off the mud from the face of one of the dead men, he there








                                          <pb id="p.385" n="385"/>

beheld the features of his deadliest foe, Spikely.  The other was soon
recognised as Brassinjaw, the vintner of the Bridge; and every one
present shuddered, on removing more of the mud, to find that the nails
of Brassinjaw were completely embedded in the flesh of Spikely's throat.
Horton turned away in horror, for he recollected all the scenes of guilt
and depravity he had himself shared with both those now poor harmless,
lifeless, clods of festering humanity.
  </p><p>Having found the body of Brassinjaw, the mystery of the house being
closed seemed clearly accounted for, so it was at once broken open, when,
in going into the lower rooms, a sight met their eyes, no less appalling
than that which they had just left, for there they discovered the lifeless
body of Nan, hanging to the rope that came down from the roof of the
closet. In her despair, when she had somewhat recovered from the ill-
usage of her husband, she had looked around for any means of escape-
none but that of death presented itself: the rope she saw seemed to invite her to the deed: she had mounted on a stool, had tied the rope around
her neck, then kicking away the stool, which was found upset close by
her, her weight, in falling, had withdrawn the bolts, and thus unconsciously, she it was who had sent the two vile, miserable, wretches to
their dread account. The body was immediately cut down, but it was
found to have been dead for many hours. Thus ended three of the
most determined wretches of our eventful tale.
 </p><p> We must now, once again, convey our indulgent readers to the Cottage
on the Heath. More than one, nay, more than two, and even more
than three days, had elapsed, since the old man left for London; but,
strange as it may appear, although Anne had at his starting been so very
anxious to learn the fate of his mission, which was merely that of breaking off all hope of a union with Lord Talbot, yet now, although he had
been away upwards of three long days, her anxiety had so far vanished,
that she was scarcely aware he had been away at all. What caused
this wondrous change we shall soon be compelled to divulge.
 </p><p> It may be remembered that when Anne was a mere child, and
travelling about from fair to fair, her mind had been strongly directed
towards Protestantism by the old man, who was, in secret, a disciple of
Luther, and the other leaders of the reformation; the seeds then sown
had taken deep root in her heart, and had since produced an abundant
harvest of religious convictions. Whether this tendency of hers towards
the simpler doctrines of the Protestant Faith had any thing to do with
the conversion of Edward Osborne, we cannot say; it might have had
its weight in first opening his eyes to the truth; but we believe his
ultimate cession from Catholicism, took place from no other causes, than
those arising from deep reflection; but after the accession of Edward the
sixth, conversion became almost a fashion.  The shepherds of the
reformed flock no longer feared to preach openly; and in every town,
and in almost every village, was some place set apart, in which the
celebration of the reformed worship might be attended.
 </p><p> Such a place had now been opened for some time past upon the Heath.
The old crypt of the ruined chapel had been cleared out, and in doing
this, many an antique work of architectural beauty was laid bare. The
few openings that had originally let in a little, but a very little light,








<pb id="p.386" n="386"/>                     .

had been completely filled up, so that the service which was now performed there, always took place by lamp light. There were but few
lights required, for the congregation was as yet but very small.
 </p><p> The old man had been, as might naturally be expected, a constant
attendant, and with him Anne, and sometimes Osborne also; the merchant, who had never been a bigot in religion, also felt pleasure at times
in listening to the pastor's reading of the scriptures, and would often declare he had derived vast comfort from the holy man's lecture which
followed.
 </p><p> It was scarcely midday, when the old man presented himself at the
Cottage. As he approached the sitting-room, the door of which was
a-jar, he heard the voice of Osborne reading aloud; the words were from
the Bible. He opened the door so gently, that those within the room
heard him not, and there he beheld a sight, that considering the exhortations he had given to Edward at their parting, was one that clearly
proved his commands had not been quite strictly attended to, for there
sat Edward and Anne close together, her one hand resting affectionately
upon his shoulder, the other hand closely locked in his own. They were
both intently perusing the Holy Book, but Osborne was reading aloud.
  </p><p>" Well," thought the old man, " this is a pretty way of two despairing hearts setting about parting for ever; but as different people have
different ways of doing the same thing, I suppose this is theirs."
  He stood quietly contemplating the lovers, until the reading ceased.
He then gave a slight ahem! which caused Edward and Anne to start
round. Poor Anne felt her own situation so acutely, that, for the moment, she could not meet the unexpected gaze of the old man, so did
what was, under the embarrassing circumstances, perhaps the wisest
thing she could do-namely, ran, and throwing her arms round his neck,
hid her blushes in his bosom. Osborne himself felt a little confused-
indeed, very much so, not alone because the old man had come upon them
so unexpectedly, but because he scarcely knew how to commence what
he had determined to say, and which he had said over and over again to
himself admirably when alone; but now he could not conjure up a single
word.
 </p><p> "Edward," said the old man, shaking his head at Osborne, while he
still held the lovely Anne close to his heart, " is this well ?-Is this the
way in which you ever keep your promises ?"
 </p><p> " I made no promises," replied Osborne; " I listened to all you said,
but I listened silently; I would not promise, for you had told me that
which would have robbed me of all power to keep such promise. If we
have done wrong in laying open to each other our soul's most inward
hopes, you, you alone should bear the blame; had you not divulged to
me the love Anne bore me, I had died of anguish, rather than have
spoken of my love to her."
 </p><p> " Be not angry with Edward, dear grandfather," said Anne, looking
up in the old man's face so imploringly, that he felt constrained, in pity,
to dispel the frown he had put on; and, kissing her forehead, murmured
-" Poor child, poor child !"
 </p><p> " If any one be to blame," continued Anne, " 'tis I-indeed it is."
 </p><p> " Of course it is," said the old man, slightly smiling; " I never yet







                                       <pb id="p.387" n="387"/>

found maid who loved, but ever took all blame upon herself; such feeling is an ingredient in woman's nature, and you had been no true woman,
Anne, without it. But I want not to find fault; I want to find out the
reason for this sudden change. Speak, Edward, tell me how this has
come to pass ?"
 </p><p> " How can you ask ?" replied Osborne. " It is self evident-I betrayed myself, in telling my love for her-you betrayed her, in telling
her love for me; you cannot keep two hearts that love asunder; mutual
love is like a taper lighted at both ends-however far apart the flames
may be at first, they will creep on and on, till, meeting in the midst,
blaze forth as one."
</p><p>  " Yes," replied the old man, " and then go out."
 </p><p> The look which Anne and Edward cast at each other upon hearing
this, was one of intense affection, but certainly not at all complimentary,
as regarded their opinion of the old man's wisdom.
 </p><p> " But what says my father," enquired Anne; "what have I to hope or
fear ?"
 </p><p> The old man shook his head, and said-" Before I relate what has
passed in town, do you relate to me what has passed here; the longer I
am silent, perhaps the happier for you."
 </p><p> Poor Anne's heart sunk within her, as she heard the words.
</p><p>  Osborne, seeing the sudden change, took her hand affectionately, but
firmly in his own, as he said-" Dearest Anne, is this your promised
firmness ? We have argued on all that may chance amiss; we have determined to dare the storm-then shrink not, dear one, at the first slight
shower." Then addressing the old man, he continued-" If I must speak
first, this is our resolve-never to wed with any but each other; we
have plighted our troth; we have broken this ring together," and he
held up the half of a golden ring, " and now it were easier with a single
breath to join again these broken halves, than for the breath of a thousand mortals e'er again to disunite our hearts." Saying this he completely enfolded the willing girl in his arms, and stood for several seconds
almost frowning at the poor old man, as though he regarded him as an
enemy come to tear her from him.
 </p><p> " Oh, dear ! oh, dear ! oh, dear !" said the old man, beating his hands
against the sides of his own head; "this comes of leaving them-this
all comes of leaving them together-how will it end, how will it end ?"
 </p><p> Well, depend on it, if you will befriend us," said Edward.
</p><p>  " I befriend you-I ! how can I do so, knowing as I do the merchant's
fixed resolve." The old man now related to them, that the merchant was
thunderstruck at hearing of Anne's disinclination to become a countess,
which at the death of the Earl of Shrewsbury, she would be if she
married Lord Talbot; and he said that her father had completely
changed; all his ambition was to make her great; for he said, " he
should then be sure he had not been duped by some artful beggar, who
would play the lover to get his gold."  " I dare say I have done wrong,"
said the old man, " but I thought to serve you both; so I told the
merchant Edward's love for you."
 </p><p> "And what said he ?" enquired Edward, eagerly.
 </p><p> "Said !" replied the other, " he burst into a laugh, and then exclaimed







<pb id="p.388" n="388"/>                  .

'love her! pooh, pooh, he loves her moneybags! What Edward, the
cold, calculating, sober Edward, love any one ? absurd ! but he knows how
rich I am to a fraction, and I suppose has been fooling it with a silly
girl, who would believe what one man said as willingly as an other.
No, no, none shall wed with Anne, but he who loves her, and can put
that love beyond a doubt by bringing more to her than she to him.' I
then thought I might do something by working upon his fears, so hinted
gently that if he took not greater care, I verily believed that you would
wed without his consent at all."
 </p><p>  " And to that, how did he reply ?" exclaimed Osborne more anxiously
than before.
 </p><p>  " By another laugh," replied the old man; "and then he added, ' you
know not Edward, but I do, and he knows me ! Prove him, old man !'
he said; ' place him at the altar with my willing girl, and fifty priests
all willing to unite them-then let but Edward know he took her without my consent, and he'd refuse her at the altar's foot; for if he married thus,
he would be sure the game from him was gone for ever, and that instead
of wedding with rich Hewet's daughter, he had married with a beggar."
   " Did he say that ?" exclaimed Edward, drawing himself up proudly;
" but thank Heaven he did, for now I have the opportunity to prove, at
least to her, the real sincerity of my love. All I wish is to convince her
that I love her for herself alone."
 </p><p>  " But would that prove your love-bringing her to beggary ?" said
the old man.
  </p><p> "It would," said Anne, "if he were willing to receive a beggar's
hand; but it shall prove more, for it shall show to the world that Anne
Hewet would willingly become a beggar, to become his wife."
 </p><p>  " You are mad, you are both, stark, staring mad, to talk thus," ejaculated the old man.
</p><p>  " No, grandfather, no," said Anne; " and would you not see us really
mad, devise some plan to aid us."
 </p><p> " What plan can be better than the one I formed, dear Anne ?" said
Osborne.
 </p><p> "And what mighty plan was that ?" enquired the old man.
</p><p>  "To tempt the pastor of the ruined chapel," said Edward, " to unite
us privily; I am willing then to keep our marriage secret, and knowing
she is irrevocably mine, to say farewell in the ruined aisle-to fly to
London-accept the appointment in a foreign land-to labour night and
day; and oh, how sweet that labour then would be, for when I had
achieved an independence, then, and not till then, could I return to
claim my heart's sole treasure. I have already, more than once, prayed
of Anne to agree to this; I have spoken to the pastor, but, alas ! he
hesitates, for he cannot feel the bitter agonies of despairing love. You
might do much with him; you might persuade him-tempt him with all
I have of earthly value."
  </p><p>" And would you really," interrupted the old man, addressing Anne,
"really be willing to forego all the bright prospects that are breaking to
our view ? But no, no, wait until to-morrow, your father will then be
here, and    "
  </p><p>" To-morrow !" exclaimed both the lovers, in a tone of agony.







                                         <pb id="p.389" n="389"/>
 </p><p> "Yes," replied the old man, " and with him, I believe, the young
Lord Talbot."
 </p><p> "That name decides my fate," exclaimed Osborne; " we are one this
day, I swear, or Edward Osborne never sees the dawn of another sun."
 </p><p> " Edward, Edward," exclaimed the agonized girl, rushing to him,
"recall those words !"
 </p><p> " Foolish boy !" said the old man; " death is a simple thing to talk of
in our youth, but wait till you are my age, and then you will think him
far too quick in coming, without wishing to drag him forward with your
own impious hand.  But listen to me; I will promise nothing; but I
will, to ease your excited minds, up to the ruins, see the pastor; but it
must be on one condition-that whatever be my decision when I return, you will then abide by it."
 </p><p> Poor Osborne, and Anne too, had so wrought up their feelings, that
they scarcely, at that moment, knew what they did or said; but fancy-
ing there was a sound of hope in the old man's words, they eagerly
assented. The old man immediately left the cottage.
 </p><p> He had not been gone long, before they were surprised at hearing the
voice of Flora, singing gaily along the garden. When she entered the
parlour, she started at seeing Anne weeping bitterly, and reclining upon
Edward's shoulder, his arm around her waist.
  </p><p>"Halloo! halloo! halloo"  said Flora.  "Master Edward, do you
know what you are doing ? oh, fie ! oh, fie !"
  </p><p>" This is no moment for jesting, Flora," said Osborne. " But how is
it you are here ? Are you alone ?" he ejaculated earnestly.
 </p><p> "Alone !" she replied, " to be sure I am. But what does all this
crying and sobbing mean ? do one of you speak. Here have I been sent
on with a whole boat-load of things, and have come up for people to go
down and bring them here; for I suppose you know that the merchant
and our good dame, and Willy-of-the-Bridge, and Eoline, and somebody
Mistress Anne will be delighted to see, are coming here to-morrow, and
that somebody is young Lord Talbot; and I understand that we are to
have a wedding-at least, so they say in London, and-Why, good
gracious, Mistress Anne, you look as if you were fainting-what is the
matter ?" As Flora uttered these last words, her real kindness of heart
shone forth.
  </p><p>Osborne, who believed that Flora sincerely loved her young mistress,
now told her all that had passed, even to the present mission of the
old man.
  </p><p>" And I'm glad of it," said Flora, "and I hope to heaven that nothing
will happen to prevent so proper a scheme being carried out; I like
people to marry those they love, or how can you expect them to love
those they marry. I'll be after him," she continued, " and I'll bring
back some good news, depend upon it; and if the pastor refuses to
marry you, I'll do it myself: did not I always tell you you were cut
out for each other, and it was not my fault that you kept your eyes
shut so long. But cheer up your spirits 'till I come back-that's all,
and you shall see-you shall see."  Flora waited not for a reply, but
hurried from the Cottage.
 </p><p> With what anxiety did Edward listen to every sound; at one moment







<pb id="p.390" n="390"/>

he fancied the old man was calling him, and he hastened to the door-.
no one was there; and again he returned to the side of the weeping girl.
 </p><p> " Oh, Edward," said Anne, " I fear the old man was right; we are
mad, we must be mad to expect that the good pastor will listen to our
prayers. But surely the old man might have returned ere this! Hark,
was not that his foot ?"
  </p><p>They both listened, but no sound struck upon their ear. At least an
hour had elapsed since the old man's departure, and still neither he, nor
Flora, had returned; their anxiety had become almost insupportable,
when, suddenly, the old man entered the room. He was greatly
agitated.
  </p><p>" Why have you drawn me into this terrible perplexity ?" he said. " I
have done wrong, I know I have done wrong, but it is my love for that
poor foolish girl, that blinds me to the path I should pursue. Heaven
grant that I may not repent this day's work ! Ask me no questions; the
end is all you need at present, know-the pastor has consented."
  </p><p>" Bless him! bless him !" exclaimed Anne, as she flung herself upon
the old man's neck; " and bless you, dear grandfather, for you alone
could have worked this miracle."
  </p><p>Osborne scarcely knew whether he was awake or dreaming.
  </p><p>" Now," said the old man, " your own fates are in your own hands;
once more I pray of you-I beseech of you to reflect, while yet there is
time. In a worldly point of view, this marriage will bring ruin on you
both; remember, Edward, from the merchant you have no hope; the
moment you are married you are to leave the country, and never to
divulge this secret union, until you can come and claim your bride with
ample independence."
  </p><p>" I know all," said Edward; " and if but Anne consent to forego all
for me, can you believe me so contemptible as to hesitate one moment in
foregoing all for her ?"
 </p><p> " Well then," sighed the old man, " fate must work its way. Retire,
children, to your separate rooms, and in holy meditation prepare your
minds for the awful step you are about to take; in one hour all will be
prepared."
  </p><p>The lovers did as the old man desired. What passed in the minds
of Osborne and Anne, when left to cool reflection, it would be difficult
to describe. Notwithstanding all their fears that what they were about
to do thus clandestinely was wrong, yet love ever holds up a medium
of such a rosy tint, that all a lover sees through it, bears its own sweet
hue. Whatever reflections came of a painful nature, they were easily
dispelled by calling up the vision of the one beloved object. There
cannot be a doubt but that love is a madness; it is therefore useless to
judge of it by the cold calculating rules of wisdom. By the time the hour
had elapsed, their minds had become so much at ease, that they both
met the old man with countenances thoughtful, it is true, but smiling;
and they could not help feeling cheered by finding a slight smile also
upon the old man's face.
  </p><p>"Come," he said, "my children, I will not check the little happiness
that your trembling hearts might feel, upon this most eventful day of








                                             <pb id="p.391" n="391"/>

 your whole lives, by seeming sad; come then, my children, come to the
 ruined chapel."
   </p><p> In another minute and they were on their road to happiness or misery
 for life.
   </p><p> They had not been gone but scarcely a short half-hour, when along
 the road leading from London, a rather extensive cavalcade might be
 seen approaching, which, had the lovers beheld, would have cast them into
 hopeless despair. It was the merchant and his party, all but Lord
 Talbot! The effect this unlooked-for arrival had upon the fates of our
 hero and heroine, we must leave to a future chapter to disclose.</p>

 </p><p>HORTON'S ease of mind, caused by the discovery of the dead bodies of
 two of those, whom he had long since regarded as his bitterest foes, was
 not of long continuance, for just as he had left the city by the Posterngate, for the death of Spikely had changed his plans of going to Gravesend,
 he happened to pass by a carpenter's yard, in which two workmen were
 grinding their tools, and talking very loudly.
  </p><p> "It always was so, and it always will be so," said the carpenter who
 was turning the stone, "blood will have blood, and murder will out: I
 was one of those who brought the murdered knight out of the wood."
 </p><p>  As these words struck upon Horton's ear he started, though he scarcely
 would confess to himself the reason why.
 </p><p>  "It's some years now," said the man, " since that happened,
but I remember it as well as if it were yesterday: we carried him to
merchant Hewet's on the Bridge. It was the merchant that found the
knight."
 </p><p>  Horton no longer doubted the subject upon which the carpenter was
dilating, and felt as if spell-bound to the spot; he longed to hear more,
yet dreaded what might follow.-" But why should I?" he said inwardly,
" they know not me; and if aught of danger has transpired, the sooner
I gain the knowledge, the sooner may such danger be averted."
 </p><p>  "At this moment, the carpenter who had been holding the tools was
called away; and Horton, as an excuse for entering into conversation
with the man, who was now standing listlessly against the stone, drew
out the broken knife, and said-" Come, my good fellow, give me a turn
or two, will you? and I will give you a flagon of ale.  I have broken
the point off my knife here."








<pb id="p.392" n="392"/>                    .

 </p><p> "Oh, right willingly, master," replied the man, "and I'll drink
you a long life and a happy."
</p><p>  The man began to turn the stone. Horton placed the dagger-knife
upon it, and as many a man figuratively has done before, was unconsciously sharpening a weapon to pierce his own side with.
 </p><p> " Were you not talking about some strange murder ?" said Horton, in
a careless tone.
 </p><p> "Ay, marry was I," replied the man, " of a murder that mayhap
you may remember, the murder of Sir Filbut Fussy many years ago ?"
 </p><p> " No," said Horton, " I remember nothing of it-curse the knife !"
he exclaimed, " I've cut my hand."
</p><p>  The cut not being of much consequence, he resumed his labour, as the
man went on to relate all the circumstances of the assassination; to these
Horton was compelled to listen, having, as he had done, told the man
he remembered nothing of them--" Yes," said the man, "there were no
less than five stabs, that had been done with a knife, it was supposed,
just of that sort."
</p><p>  Horton's eye fell upon the blade, and there he beheld the stains, which
at that moment to his imagination, looked like so many bleeding tongues,
that called out murder !
 </p><p> "That will do," he said, quickly hiding the knife from his own sight,
by placing it in his girdle: " but why did you say, as I think I heard
you, that murder would out ?"
 </p><p> " Oh," said the man, " because murder always does, and so has this
-at least it's pretty sure to do. We have had the officers here, not ten
minutes before you came, to tell me that I shall be wanted again to give
evidence; for it seems that it is almost certain now, from some secret information lately received, that the murderer was one of Hewet's apprentices, a worthless scoundrel called Harry Horton; he has bolted, so they.
say, but they're after him, and I hope yet to see him hanged."
 </p><p> Horton frowned, and flinging down the money he had promised,
hurried away. " He has betrayed me then," he exclaimed, " and his
death will bring no safety. I must fly this kingdom for ever; but
whither shall I go ? Could I but pass the borders, in Scotland I were
safe, and yet might with my sword, cut out a better fortune than seems
to beset me here." He took out a leather purse, and began to count his
money. " I have scarcely enough to buy a horse, and keep me too,
until I have crossed the border; well, I must trudge it a foot, until
chance shall allow me to beg, borrow, or steal a nag."
 </p><p> In order to help him on his way, he drew forth the knife, and going
to a hedge close by, cut a strong cudgel of a good ell in length, and as
he tramped along, he trimmed off the rough knots; while thus employed
he became lost in thought, and unconscious of whither he was strolling.
From his reverie he was suddenly aroused by hearing a loud voice
bawling out, " Why don't you look where you're going-you'll have
your brains kicked out."
 </p><p> Horton, raising his eyes, now found that he was in Smithfield, close
to a horse that was backing towards him; the man before the horse's
head was pulling at the bridle, but the horse dragged him along. It






                     <pb id="p.393" n="393"/>

  being market-day, there was a crowd standing by, but all appeared
  afraid of approaching too near.
  </p><p>   " Damn him !" said the man; "I wish a knife was in him."
  </p><p>   Horton, as he sprung aside, gave the animal a sharp blow with his
  hedge-stick, which made the horse plunge forward, and then to kick as if
  he had been mad."
 </p><p>   " You seem to have an awkward customer there, friend," said Horton,
  addressing the man; "he has evidently more blood in his veins than
  flesh on his bones; and has more of the devil than the dove about him."
  </p><p>  " Hang me," said the man, " if I don't think he isthe devil himself,
  or some witch in the shape of a horse."
  </p><p>  "He can't be a witch, Master Giles," observed one of the bystanders,
  "for you see he's got a tail, though it's a rum'un, and that's a part of
  an animal, bird, or fish, that witches can't come at-not any how: I
  suppose that's why so many witches appear like old women, for old
  women, having no tails, do you see, it's plaguy difficult to find out
  which is a witch, and which isn't."
  </p><p>  Whether the horse took any interest in this conversation, we know
  not; but he certainly became, suddenly, very quiet, and allowed the
  bridle to be put properly over his head.
   </p><p> " There are many good points about him," observed Horton, looking
  at the animal with the eye of a profound judge of horseflesh; " and
  when he was young, must have been a sightly beast; would you
  sell him ?"
   </p><p> " Sell him !" exclaimed the man, " would I not, if I could find a
  fool great enough to buy him; but he's too well known in Smithfield to
  find a customer here! We can only use him to draw timber, and he
  won't do that but when he likes."
   </p><p> " Well," said Horton, " I have never yet seen a horse that could
  conquer me; put on a saddle; and old as he is, and vicious as he seems
  to be, I may perhaps be a customer, if your charge be monstrous low."
   </p><p>  " There's no difficulty in putting a saddle on him," replied the man;
"but putting yourself on him is quite another thing."
   </p><p> " Pshaw !" ejaculated Horton; "if we are to buy and sell, we must
  do so quickly, for I have no time to spare."
   </p><p> " You'll take all blame to yourself," said the man, as he was saddling
  the horse; "and if he gives you an awkward kick when you try to
  mount him, don't blame me: and I'll tell you what I'll do-I'll bet you
  a silver groat that you don't get on at all; and I'll bet you another silver
  groat, that if you do, you're off again before you can say Billy-the-bird-
  catcher."
   </p><p> " Done," said Horton, who, always vain of his horsemanship, now felt
  proud, fancying he had an opportunity of shewing off his skill in
  equitation. Horton's first care was to examine the girths, then the
  stirrup leathers, and last of all, the bridle; the whole seeming sound
  and firm, the time to mount had arrived.
   </p><p>  " You had better pay the two groats, and give up the trial," said
  the man, "for I tell you he'll kick your inside out before he'll let you
  back him."
   </p><p> "That's may affair," replied Horton; "I'll tame the brute, or kill








<pb id="p.394" n="394"/>

  him, or he shall kill me; depend on this, no horse shall ever conquer me."
   </p><p> The people by could not imagine what Horton was about, when
 they saw him climb a cresset-post; there was a projection about four or
 five feet up the post; upon this he placed one of his feet, and holding by
 the upper part swung outwards; then extending his legs, he told the man
 to lead the horse quietly past the post; the man understood his manoeuvre,
 and nodding to Horton, did as he was desired ; the moment the horse
 was exactly beneath Horton, he dropped upon the saddle; the animal
 for a moment seemed taken by surprise, and trembled all over; this
 moment was enough for his rider to succeed in placing his feet firmly in
 the stirrups.
  </p><p> " The first groat is mine !" exclaimed Horton triumphantly, and the
 bystanders set up a shout of laughter; this seemed to awake the horse,
 for instantly he began to rear, and plunge, and then to kick violently;
 but Horton still kept his seat; and laughing, cried out-" Billy-the-bird-
 catcher; there goes your other groat."
 </p><p>  This caused another shout of laughter.  The horse now took to a new
 maneuvre to dismount his rider, and that was by swiftly turning round
 and round as on a pivot; but finding this avail him nothing, he once
 more took to rearing, which he now did to such a frightful extent, that
 at every instant, it was feared he would fall backwards and crush his
 rider beneath him.
   </p><p>Of this Horton himself now began to have some fear ; so raising his
 heavy stick, he gave the horse a violent blow between the ears, which
 made him drop as though he had been shot. As he fell, Horton managed
 to alight with his own feet upon the ground, still striding across the
 animal.  Now a general cry was raised for Horton to escape. " Get off,
 get off!" exclaimed at least fifty voices at once.
  </p><p> " No, no," said Horton, "if once I'm off, he'll never let me get on
again; I must be master now or never."
 </p><p>  Such determination as that of Horton's, and his apparent knowledge of horsemanship, raised him wonderfully in the estimation of the
crowd around. Horton observed their admiration, and by it his vanity
was excited to the highest pitch.  Presently the horse began to move,
and then to snort violently, and shake his head.
  </p><p> " I have conquered him !" exclaimed Horton, " and now, with me,
he'll be a lamb."
  </p><p> In this the rider was at fault, for he had scarcely said the words, ere
the horse was again upon his feet; for a time he seemed drunk or
groggy, but with all his vice still unsubdued; he champed at his bit,
and at last getting it in his teeth, darted off wildly mad; still Horton
was on his back, and seemed as though he had grown to his seat. On
flew the horse defying all power of rein.
 </p><p> Horton exerted every nerve to pull him in; all was useless; still on
flew the horse. Just as he had entered the last street leading into the
open roads, the reins gave way, and by the sudden jerk Horton was
flung from the saddle. A violent cry of horror was raised by all who
saw the fall, for one of Horton's feet had slipped through the stirrup,
and he was now being dragged bleeding on the ground; yet still the
horse flew on. Horton's shrieks seemed to add new fears to the wild









                                            <pb id="p.395" n="395"/>

and maddened brute, whose speed now rendered all thoughts of pursuit
hopeless.  Horton, whose senses were not yet quite gone, made violent
efforts to release his foot, but all were unavailing, and on, and on, flew
the horse.  The poor wretch's clothes were torn to shreds, and blood and
flesh now began to mark the road as the infuriated animal past along.
The horse at last began to slacken his pace from sheer exhaustion, but
still went on; Horton's now lifeless body, had become a shapeless mass
of torn and bloody flesh.
  </p><p> A close wood was lying before the phrenzied horse; towards this he flew
with vigour, once again renewed, as if anxious to reach it, that he might
there die away from the sight of man; again more slow, and now
tottering, became his pace; but on, and on, he still dragged his gory
victim.  The wood was close and dark, but at the further end of the
road appeared an open space where all was light; he had nearly reached
this outlet, when exhausted nature suddenly gave way, and falling
heavily upon the earth, was dead.
  </p><p> Although the horse had soon outstripped his horror-stricken pursuers,
they found no difficulty in tracking his course; awful traces of Horton's
dreadful fate were too clear and many, to leave a doubt as to the road on
which he had been dragged. When the pursuers reached the wood, it
was found that the horse had fallen dead exactly upon the spot where
Horton had stabbed the young knight; and it seemed as though the
hand of avenging fate had directed the way the horse should go, thus to
render the poor unconscious animal the executor of justice upon his master's murderer; for it so happened that the old horse was the very same
restive creature upon which the knight had ridden with Alyce, as they
journeyed from  Old London Bridge to Westminster.  But even beyond
this the hand of retribution seemed to have been at work, for the knife,
the very one with which Horton had assassinated Sir Filbut, and which
he himself had so recently sharpened, was now found with the blade
deeply embedded in his heart, driven there by the violent dashing of the
body upon the earth.</p>

WHETHER it was the sun of joy that lighted up their hearts, and thence
sent forth its rays to illumine whatever came within their sight, it is not
easy to determine; but this is certain, that as young Osborne, with the
lovely Anne, stepped lightly on their way towards the ruins of the chapel, all nature, at least to them, seemed to smile around; the sky appeared suddenly to have become much brighter, the air much softer, and



<figure id="fig.00023" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.030.DO01.00023"><head>The Death</head> </figure>



<pb id="p.396" n="396"/>                   .

to breathe with a warmer glow: the early spring flowers were timidly
peeping forth, from spots well sheltered from the northern winds, and
now were courting the kisses of the genial southern breeze.
 </p><p> " How sweet and soft the air !" said Anne.
 </p><p> " Not half so sweet and soft as thy sweet sighs," replied Osborne.
 </p><p> " And how clear and bright the blue that o'erspreads the skies," said
the lovely girl.
 </p><p> " Not half so clear and bright as the blue of thy dear eyes !" observed
Edward.
 </p><p> Anne looked up at her lover in astonishment, so unexpected were such
expressions from the lips of Osborne; but she thanked him for his flattery, by a kinder pressure of his arm, and then they went on again in
silence.
 </p><p> The wings which love had given to their feet, were terribly weighed
down by the old man's unusually slow steps, and ever and anon he
stopped, and turning, looked back towards the Cottage. He did this so
often, that it at last attracted the lovers' notice, and a sudden fear seized
upon them.
  </p><p>" Why do you look so anxiously behind, dear grandfather ?" said
Anne; -" surely there is no danger of pursuit ?"
  </p><p>" Who should pursue us, Anne ?" observed Osborne.  " Who is there
who knows of our intent ?"
  </p><p>They were now completely out of sight of the Cottage, and the ruined
chapel stood picturesquely out at no great distance. The old man endeavoured to mend his pace; but still there was a heaviness in his every
step.
 </p><p> " Light hearts and light heels," observed the old man, " usually run
well together; but age and youth are ill-matched competitors in any
race.  The chapel to you is the haven of your hopes-to me, it only
speaks of death. But I promised not to cast a shadow o'er your bliss;
so on, children, on, and the old man will not be far behind."
 </p><p> The lovers now insisted upon his walking between them, and resting
upon their arms; and in this way they reached the chapel.
 </p><p> When they descended into the old crypt, they found the assistant
there, but the pastor was absent. This crypt was very ancient, and had
doubtless belonged to a building of much greater magnitude than that of
the ruined chapel above. There were several ancient tombs, the inscriptions of which were completely obliterated by the hand of time. A
single lamp hung from the roof, which lighted but a very scanty space
around; the rest was all in gloom, and indeed many parts were in total
darkness. They seated themselves on an old stone seat, and then a long
deathlike silence ensued.
 </p><p> After a time, the old man rose, and went to the assistant, who was
attentively reading from an iron-bound massive Bible, and whispered
something into his ear; the man immediately quitted his seat, and retired, and then another lengthened silence ensued; but still the pastor
made not his appearance.  Osborne's anxiety was becoming unendurable; he feared, yet knew not what he feared. Anne too seemed sad,
and heaved many an involuntary sigh; suddenly they both started at
hearing a female voice. It was the voice of Flora. For the time, they had








                                           <pb id="p.397" n="397"/>
completely forgotten that she had said she would follow the old man to
the chapel.  Her presence seemed to reassure them, for she ever looked
at the bright side of all things.
  </p><p> Not long after Flora's appearance, the good pastor arrived, and with
him several of his flock, principally country labourers, and a few substantial-looking farmers, and then commenced a short service. When
this was ended, some of the little congregation left the place, and some
few still remained to witness the marriage; but they all stood at a distance, and were completely lost in the gloomy recesses. The pastor
commenced, by offering up a very devout prayer for a blessing upon the
work he was about to perform, and after this the marriage ceremony
commenced. Anne felt her heart beating violently at every succeeding
sentence.  The only persons that came within the range of the lamp's
feeble rays, were the pastor, the assistant, the kneeling lovers, Flora, who
stood on one side, and the old man, who rested against a tomb in the rear.
Osborne and the lovely Anne never raised their eyes for a moment from
the earth; so strange, so unaccountable seemed their positions, that
they felt bewildered-lost.  The only time when Osborne for a moment
regained his confidence, and his voice no longer trembled, was as he uttered the vow to love and cherish her he was then making his own for
ever. It had, of course, been settled that the old man was to act as
the father to give away the bride; they fancied they heard him
weep, as the footsteps unsteadily advanced, when the moment had
arrived to place the hand of Anne in that of Edward.  It was a moment of real pain to Anne, for the thought flew through her heart, of
" why was not her own father there to perform the act." She felt the
hand that took hers tremble as violently as her own; but when hers
was placed in that of Osborne, the pressure of true affection he bestowed upon it, acted like a spell, to banish from her soul all thoughts but
one, and that thought was-he is my husband!
  </p><p>The moment the ceremony was finished, the few of the congregation
who had remained, hurried away to their various avocations; but the
pastor kept the young pair some time longer, listening to an exhortation
and holy lecture for their governance in their future altered state of being.
 </p><p> When they arose from their kneeling position, Flora went up to
Edward, and whispered rather loudly-" You ought to kiss her."
 </p><p> Osborne started, and was rather confused at hearing such a speech;
but, supposing Flora knew much better than he did, he saluted his beloved Anne, and ever after declared, that " that kiss was the sweetest
he had ever had, always excepting the last."
 </p><p> As they returned to the cottage, Flora would not allow them to be
sad, at least she endeavoured to prevent them, by continually addressing
Anne as " Dame Osborne," and said, " she was perfectly astonished to
see how much older she looked since she had become a married woman."
 </p><p> She would have succeeded to a degree in cheering them; but the old
man, at once reminding them of their sacred pledge to part as soon as
wedded, now seemed like a dagger thrust into their very hearts. "It
is for her sake more than your own," said the old man; " do not, by
breaking your word with me, cast her from splendid affluence to abject

<pb id="p.398" n="398"/>                     .

poverty: until the sun has fairly set you may remain, but then your
promise must be fulfilled."
 </p><p> " It shall," exclaimed Osborne, " though its fulfilment should break
my heart; but my heart will not break, for in my exile the thought that
she is mine, will render that heart still firmer to endure, still prouder
to achieve. I have something now to live for, something to labour for,
something to die for, if needs must be. Oh, my own sweet, dear, dear,
Anne! the world cannot now exile me from you as long as this heart
shall beat, for in it you are so firmly set, that nought but death can ever
again tear you from it. All I ask, is, do not weep when I shall say
farewell; but cheer our parting with a smile, dear girl; 'tis easier to
fly from smiles than tears."
 </p><p> Anne did attempt a smile; but a tear would steal forth to dim its
brightness.-" There are many hours yet, before the sun shall set, that
we shall be together; and in those hours we must arrange our plans;
and-"
 </p><p> Just as he had proceeded thus far, they arrived at the cottage-gate.
When they entered the sitting-room, Osborne and Anne had nearly
fallen to the ground, so completely taken off their guard were they at
finding the merchant, Alyce, and the whole party there.  This seemed
the deadliest blow that could have fallen upon Edward's heart.  And
should he be compelled to separate from his beloved Anne-his now true
wife-and without a word, scarcely a look ?
  </p><p>" Why, boy and girl," said the merchant, " what ails you ?"
 </p><p> Anne ran to her mother, and throwing her arms around her neck, began
to weep.
  </p><p>" Why, Edward," continued the merchant, " you look as deadly pale
as though you had just committed murder, or matrimony ; and the one,
in certain cases, is little less a crime than the other.  I bring you good
news, boy-take that," saying which, he placed a sealed packet in Edward's hand; " there are your credentials; I have settled everything, I
am sure, to your satisfaction.  But you must start this very night; the
best of all my ships will sail with you early in the morning, and then I
have done all a master can be expected to do for his apprentice; after
that, you must look to yourself for happiness and fortune.  There now,
no thanks; and whilst the repast is being prepared-and, egad, I hope it
will not take long, for our ride has made me as hungry as a wolf-do
you and Anne go take a stroll, and bid each other good bye, for your
stay abroad will perhaps be a lengthy one."
  </p><p>These but few words seemed to remove a mountain off Edward's
breast: he would still have a few moments alone with Anne, when they
could arrange how they might hear from each other. When they were
alone together, they could no longer blind themselves to the misery of
their position. At one moment Anne would have braved all, rather
than endure the pain of parting; but the next she shuddered at the
thought of the storm, that would surely follow such a revelation.
  </p><p>Over all the vows, the sighs, the prayers, the promises, the oaths they
mutually breathed from their inmost hearts, we must draw a veil; such
secrets are too sacred to be lightly dealt with. When their allotted time








                                      <pb id="p.399" n="399"/>

had elapsed, they had so far subdued their feelings, as at least to appear
composed.
  </p><p>During the whole of the repast, the merchant would keep joking, and
was more than usually merry.  He certainly did not mention Lord
Talbot by name; but it was easy for Edward to guess the party meant,
when Hewet, laughing, told the company, that before Osborne should
return from abroad, he hoped to have a right worthy son-in-law-one that
lie might be proud of--" So, Edward, boy, look at your sister well, for you
will never again see her unmarried."
 </p><p> Both Osborne and Anne could not help feeling how true was that
speech, but that how little did the speaker know wherein its truthfulness might lie.
  </p><p>The Cripple too was wondrous jocular; but he could now afford to be
right merry, for he was rich in all that could bring happiness to man;
and the Bridge-shooter with Flora were as wild and foolish as playful
kittens.
  </p><p>All this mirth made poor Osborne and his sweet Anne more and
more sad; but this was natural, for Edward was that day to leave all
that he had hitherto regarded as his kindred and his home. When the
moment had really arrived, Anne could no longer restrain her
tears; but the merchant only laughed at her for her weakness, and
told her that she ought to be delighted, for her brother was entering
upon the road to fortune and to happiness. Edward could not trust
himself to say " farewell!" to any one; but biting his lips, as if he
thought that would keep down his swelling heart, he seized his cap-
his hand was on the fastening of the door-he cast one look back upon
Anne, and was about to rush forth, when he was called back by the
merchant.
  </p><p>" Why, boy," exclaimed the merchant, " you have forgotten the most
important thing of all !"
 </p><p> Osborne turned, and there he saw the sealed packet-" I had indeed,"
he said; and then once more approached the door.
   </p><p>" Well," again exclaimed the merchant, " you will forget your head
next, I imagine: now, is there nothing else you have to take ?"
  </p><p> " Nothing that I can remember," replied Osborne, now scarcely able
to support himself.
  </p><p> "Is money nothing ?" said the merchant; "or do you think you can
travel half round the world without it ? There is a well--stocked purse-
take it, and what more you require, when in a foreign land, my agents
will supply."
</p><p>   Edward felt almost as much pain at finding how willingly all but
 one could see him depart, as he did at parting with all he now wished
 to live for; but he was determined to suppress his feelings until lie
 might give vent to them in secret. Once more his hand was on the door,
 and once more, as if to torture him still further, the merchant exclaimed
 -" Why, the boy will drive one mad with his forgetfulness; the most
 particular thing of all he has again forgotten."
  </p><p> " What have I now forgotten, master ?" said Edward, in an imploring tone; "what have I still forgotten ?"
   </p><p>" What have you still forgotten ?" replied the merchant, imitating







<pb id="p.400" n="=400"/>

Edward's tone of voice, " why, that which few men are ever allowed to
forget, if once they have possessed it; you have forgotten -  your wife !"
  </p><p> " In Heaven's name what mean you ?" exclaimed Edward Osborne,
his eyes staring with astonishment.
 </p><p>  Anne clung trembling to her mother, and became ashy pale.
 </p><p>  " What mean I ?" replied the merchant. " Master Hewet is one of
those who generally means exactly what he says. Come hither, and if
you can do so, deny what I have said. Have you, or have you not, a
wife ?"
  </p><p> " I have," replied Edward.
  </p><p> "And that wife was my child," said Hewet. "Now, mark me,
Edward; what you have done, you have done not blindly; you knew
my thoughts upon the subject of that child's future destiny, as clearly
as I did myself; I have often, and often told you, that were she ever to
wed without my full knowledge and consent, that from that hour she
was no longer a child of mine." Again Anne clung more closely to
her mother. " Do you remember hearing me utter that determination ?"
 </p><p>  "I do," replied Osborne, who, now all hope seemed past, felt a
powerful return of his self-possession; " I do remember it, for you
feared, you said, that your fortune, not your daughter's love, would
be the aim of him who wedded her. It was that very knowledge
which first inspired me with hope, for I felt- "
 </p><p>  " How little I care for what you felt," observed the merchant, "you
will discover when you read the contents of the packet you now hold.
Break the seals at once, for it were better that you know the worst at
once, for my determination is irrevocable."
  </p><p> All the time Osborne with trembling hands was opening the packet,
poor Anne fixed her eyes kindly upon him; he caught her glance, and his
breast heaved with joy, for in that glance he read, that come what evil fate
there might, there was still one kind heart left that would ever beat with
love for him. He tore open the packet, and upon reading but a single
line, became more bewildered than ever.
 </p><p> " Good Heavens !" he exclaimed, turning his imploring gaze upon his
master, " speak to me, and tell me, am I in a dream, or is all that I see
and hear, and feel, reality ?"
 </p><p> " If the boy is too great a dunce," observed Hewet, " to read such a
plain document as that, do you, Willy-of-the-Bridge, read it for him."
 </p><p> The Cripple took the parchment, when the whole mystery was soon
made clear; it was a deed of partnership between William Hewet and
Edward Osborne, in every way completed but the signatures.
 </p><p> "And have I forfeited all this goodness," exclaimed Osborne, "by
my mistaken hope of proving my disinterested love for her ?"
 </p><p> "You would have done so," replied the merchant, " had you married
her without my knowledge and consent; but know, to your astonishment,
that the hand which placed her hand in yours, was that of her father.
You were both too deeply absorbed to perceive, that instead of our old
friend there approaching the altar, that it was her father who took his
place.  It was I, her father, who willingly gave her to you; it is I, her
father, who now open my arms to receive a son !"
 </p><p> As Osborne flew into the extended arm of the  merchant, Flora






      <pb id="p.401" n="401"/>

blubbered aloud; the Bridge-shooter made a monstrous wry face; and, indeed, there was no lack of tears, to moisten the eyes of any present; but
they were soon changed into smiles, when the merchant explained that the
whole had been a plan of his own to unite his daughter to Edward.
 </p><p> "From the moment," said Hewet, " that you, Edward, dashed fearlessly into the flood to save that child's life, I prayed to Heaven that
that life you had so bravely saved, might one day prove a blessing to
you. All that I have ever toll you, about my fear of her wedding with
one who saw her virtues in her wealth, was true; and it was to put the
purity of your love to the proof, that all has happened as it really has."
 </p><p> " Now," said the old man, "perhaps you can guess why I loitered
so upon the road, and why so much delay occurred in the chapel; the
fact is, the merchant was behind his time, or rather you before yours."
 </p><p> " Yes," said Flora, " and but for my haste in flying back, to apprize
the merchant at the Ferry, and bring him on at once, perhaps you would
not have been married at all; but as it is, why, you may now enjoy
 </p><p>               <quote rend="blockquote"><l> " The Dream of Love, the sweetest dream,
                   </l><l>That ever haunts the midnight hour."</l></quote>
But I must say no more, for I see the bashful poet is blushing already."
</p><p>  Never were such happy faces seen, as those that now smiled upon one
another. In the evening the ceemony of signing the deed of partnership took place, and every one present witnessed it; when it came to
the Bridge-shooter, he gave a prodigious flourish.-" Ah," said he, " I
did that, just to show Flora what a flourishing young man I am." Even
the sweet and gentle Eoline made a mark upon the deed, and then kissing the newly-made bride, placed upon. her neck a golden chain, to
which was attached the diamond ornament so frequently mentioned
before.  It originally belonged to a youth, the first, and only love of the
Abbess, who had given it to her: it had been stolen by Nan's sister,
and had passed from her through a Jew, to old Sir Filbut Fussy; from
him it descended to the young knight; the Abbess had recovered it
through Spikely's confession when he thought he was dying. In the wreck
it was believed to have been lost; but by a most strange chance, Eoline
remained, though unknowingly, the bearer of it to the Heath; it had
become entangled in the folds of her dress, and had remained there until
the night when it was discovered by Flora and William, amongst the
wood ashes on the hearth. As Eoline had passed the fire on her retiring that evening, it had slipped into the smouldering embers.
 </p><p> The sight of it had a strange effect upon Alyce, for it brought back to
her remembrance all the horrors she had endured in her madness. The
merchant gazed at her with intense anxiety as she looked upon the
bauble; observing this, she turned upon him one of her sweetest smiles, and
said -- " Be not alarmed for me, my dear, it has no power over me now."
</p><p>  In a few days, and Osborne was on his way to a foreign shore, but not
as he so lately dreaded he should be, for now he was sailing as a princely
merchant, in one of their own ships, and with him his adored wife and
Flora. They were to be away for a long time; and while they are on their
tour, we will pause awhile, ere we say farewell to our gentle readers.
 </p><p> It is perhaps in life, as it generally is in books, that when once marriage
takes place, the romance is at an end; but with regard to Osborne and
Anne, in losing the romance of love, they found its reality.</p>

</p><p>
                  IN the time of Edward the Sixth,
                  there stood an old house at the
                  end of Chancery Lane, of which
             the above engraving is an exact representation. This house may be taken as a
             fair sample of the general style of London
             buildings, three hundred years ago, and
             it was from this house Dame Spikely was
             conducted by Horton, when she went to
             give evidence in the Law Court of West-
             minster. It was soon destined, however,
to become the home of a very different character, for it had lately been
purchased by Master Hewet for the purpose of carrying out one of
his long-premeditated plans. But of that anon.

<figure id="fig.00025" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.030.DO01.00025"><head>William Flood's House, at the Corner of Chancery Lane</head> </figure>

<pb id="p.403" n="403"/>

 </p><p> So very long had Edward, with Anne and Flora, been abroad, that
ere they returned to Old England again, wonderful changes had taken
place. Old London Bridge had been restored to its former magnificence,
and the Golden Fleece was now one of the most superb houses upon it;
but perhaps the greatest change of all, was to hear the Bridge-shooter's
altered tone of voice, as he proudly addressed his master as-" My
lord, and Alyce as my lady." By this it may be guessed, that Master
Hewet was now LORD MAYOR OF LONDON; and what was quite as
wonderful in William's own estimation, was to find himself elevated
to the dignity of master of the Lord Mayor's barge. Never before had
coat and badge been worn with greater pride, than it then was by the
Bridge-shooter, when he attended his master upon state occasions.
How often had he, when a poor ragged boy at the Old Swan Stairs,
looked with an envying eye upon the Lord Mayor's bargemen, as they
rowed proudly past, and now to find himself, not a mere bargeman, but
the very head of them all, was a circumstance more like a dream to him
than plain reality. Perhaps the proudest day of his whole bargeman's
life, which by-the-by only lasted a year, was when he attended the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress as far as Greenwich, to receive on board their
splendid boat the Lord Mayor's daughter, with her husband, and his own
dear Flora, when they returned from the continent. Flora, as she stood
watching the approaching barge, could not imagine what William meant
by holding up his right hand as high as he possibly could; it seemed as
if he were snapping his thumb and finger at her; but this she felt convinced could not be the case. The moment they had descended from
the ship into the barge, the mystery was solved at once, for between
the finger and thumb, which William kept saucily shaking close to the
pretty little nose of Flora, there she saw a wedding-ring.
 </p><p> " Oh, I shall faint, I shall faint, I know I shall!" she exclaimed, as
she pretended to fall fainting into the arms of her delighted lover. " I
remember my fatal promise-I am lost !"
 </p><p> " Yes, and I've just found you," replied William, " and remember
the finder is now to be handsomely rewarded for his trouble."
 </p><p> After the first burst of joy at the meeting had subsided, the merchant began to inform Osborne of the plans he had been arranging for
their future modes of life. " Yes," he said, " the house on the Bridge
has been rebuilt, and furnished with all the luxuries that the four quarters of the globe can bestow, and there you and Anne will live; for upon
you will now devolve all the labours of our trade. I and Alyce shall
remain in the house we now inhabit, and William is to - "
 </p><p> Here the merchant was interrupted by Flora entering the saloon of
the barge, in a violent fit of laughter. She was followed by William,
who was evidently annoyed about something; but the more he appeared
so, the more did Flora laugh, and insisted upon telling them the cause.
 </p><p> " Now, Flora, it's too bad-it is, upon my life I" said William. " But
never mind, you are master now, but I shall be after Christmas."
 </p><p>  This made Flora laugh still louder.
 </p><p>  " But what can have made the girl so mad ?" enquired Alyce.
 </p><p>  " Why, when I found," said Flora, " that the merchant-I mean his
lordship-had determined that marry William  I must, why, I consented;









<pb id="p.404" n="404"/>

 and as I wished him not to look quite so silly as some people
do when they are being married, by not knowing what they are to say
or do, I made him begin to practise.  ' Now, William,' said I, ' you
will have to say-I, William so and so-'
  </p><p>" By-the-by," interrupted Edward, " it never struck me before; but
I really believe that not one person here ever heard his other name; for
he has always been called either Billy, or William, or the Bridge-shooter.
So tell us, William, what is your name ?"
 </p><p> At this, William blushed up to his eyes, and Flora began again to
laugh.
 </p><p> " I asked him the same question; and what do you think was his
reply ? He said-' he didn't know his own name, but he'd go and ask
his mother."
 </p><p> This caused a general laugh, at the Bridge-shooter's expense. They
were now very near the Bridge; so he seized upon this circumstance as
an excuse for leaving them in their mirth. He now took the guidance
of the boat into his own hands. When they were almost close upon
the Bridge, he gave a signal. Every oar was in an instant shipped, and
in another moment the barge shot gallantly down the fall. The oars,
like a flash of light, once again were in the flood; and in five minutes
more they had all landed at Old Swan Stairs.
 </p><p> It had been settled that William and Flora should be married on the
day before Christmas-day, so that a right-merry wedding it was sure to
be; for the Christmas merrymakings in the olden time may be said to
have been quite serious affairs. The Christmas holidays had already
commenced, and this being the case, mirth and jollity reigned from one
end of the kingdom to the other. Every street had its singers of Christmas carols. Plays and masquerades were not only going on in private
houses, but even in the churches.  A Lord of Misrule became the commanding genius in the larger mansions; and in others a like personage took the title of King of the Bean. All the houses were hung
within and without with ivy and holly, and people danced around
standards decked with  evergreen, in the main roadways.     One
of the principal dishes at the Christmas board, was a huge boar's
head: this was always introduced with great pomp and ceremony
-loud flourishes of trumpets, or other musical instruments, announced
its approach. Even prohibited games were allowed at this season, and
indeed all the world, for a time, seemed turned upside down. Clowns
dressed themselves out as bishops and judges; and judges and
bishops became clowns, or acted the fool in various ways. The Bridge-
shooter had drawn the prize to become the " King of the Bean," and
how he obtained this dignified station, we can in a few words explain.
 </p><p> Flora had made a splendid cake, in which one bean was baked. All
Hewet's household-retainers, workmen, weavers, throwsters, and all,
were partakers of his hospitality; and when the proper time was come,
the cake was broken into pieces, and whoever gained the piece containing the bean, was lord over all for a stated time.  The Bridge-shooter
had gained it, and bravely did he lord it, particularly over Flora.
 </p><p> When he returned from having asked his mother what his name was,







 <pb id="p.405" n="405"/>

he told Flora, that there never was a name so cut out for a waterman as
his, for it was Flood-" And uncommon well it looks over the door."
 </p><p> " Over what door ?" inquired Flora.
 </p><p> " What door !" replied William; " why, over our own door, to be
sure, in-front of our house, at the end of Chancery Lane."
 </p><p> " Why, William," said Flora, " you must be mad to talk this nonsense !"
 </p><p> " If it is nonsense, it's uncommon pleasant nonsense; and you only
come and see it," said the Bridge-shooter; and as he would take no denial, Flora and he strolled towards Chancery Lane.
 </p><p> When they arrived there, it was all quite true; for there she saw, on
a board, over the door, " William Flood, Clothseller."
 </p><p> William now made her heart jump with joy, for he told her, that the
merchant had given that house to his wife, and his wife was going to
give it to Flora, as a wedding-present; and that the merchant was
stocking the place with all sorts of clothier's goods, and was going to set
William up as a retail dealer.-" Do you see that window up there ?"
said he, pointing to an upper casement.  " That's to be our nursery-
it will hold a quantity of little beds."
 </p><p> " William, William !" said Flora; " I must beg of you not to talk
about such things to me-until after to-morrow."
 </p><p> When the morrow did come, the bells were set ringing merrily. The
expected marriage of the Bridge-shooter had made a great noise in and
about the neighbourhood of Philpot Lane, and also amongst the inhabitants
on Old London Bridge; so that, when he and Flora went to the church,
they were attended by an enormous crowd of persons, all declaring they
were intimate friends of the bride or bridegroom.  Amongst these, of
course, were the four inseparables, Catchemayde, Checklocke, Silkworm,
and the sharp-nosed little arrow-maker.
 </p><p> Luckily, the mansion of the merchant Hewet was an immense building, and the great hall in which the Christmas-eve revelries were to take
place, was of a prodigious size. It was profusely decorated with ivy
and holly, and lighted by nearly a thousand tapers.  A large gallery
was crowded with musicians, who filled the air with sweetest, and
merriest strains.
  </p><p> The moment William and his pretty bride entered beneath the roof;
they were seized by his bargemen, and straightway placed, side by side,
upon the Yule-log, which had been kept near the door on purpose.
Then a shout was raised, both within and without the house. Some of
the bargemen acted the part of horses, to drag the Yule-log along, while
the rest marched at the side, as a guard of honour.
  </p><p> In this way did worthy Master William Flood and his smiling dame
enter the presence of the Lord Mayor of London and his beloved Alyce.
Behind them stood Edward and Anne; and by Hewet's side sat the old
man of the show.
  </p><p> Checklocke and Silkworm, with the little arrow-maker, all three arm-
in-arm, were the noisiest of the noisy. Poor Catchemayde had been
caught by his wife, and taken home like a naughty boy.
 </p><p>  Presently, a poor, shabby, unfortunate, poverty-stricken being, stood
forward, and made most horrible faces, which he intended to be comic.

 </p><p> Anne looked at the man with much interest, for she imagined she had
seen some one of the kind before.
</p><p>  The man very humbly begged of his Lordship to be allowed to amuse
the company.
 </p><p> " Amuse the company !" said Hewet; "why, what can such an unhappy-looking being as you do to amuse ?"
 </p><p> " Oh," said the man, making another grimace at the Lord Mayor,
and at the same moment knocking off his own hat, and slipping on a
wig, that old age had made more than half bald, " I can sing you a song,
called Diddle'em Downy !"
 </p><p> Anne was no longer in doubt about whom she was looking upon; and
whispering something to her father, she advanced to poor Downy, and
placing a purse in his hand, said-" Take that-it comes from an old
acquaintance."
 </p><p> The poor fellow appeared thunderstruck at her munificence, but before he could find words in which to utter his gratitude, Anne had again
removed far from him. He waited not for further permission, but at once
started off in his celebrated song, although he was no longer the Diddle-
'em that he had once been; yet, when he came to the words,
    <quote rend="blockquote"><l>     For be they black, white, fair, or browny,
              </l><l>And though they got up with the lark in the morn,
            </l><l>Yet none could be up to Diddle-'em-Downy,</l></quote>
there was an immense roar of laughter; but almost anything would,
upon that Christmas-eve, have caused a laugh, for everybody had come
prepared to be happy, and happy indeed they all appeared to be. It
was now proposed that every one should kiss the bride, but to this
William decidedly objected; and as he was the King of the Bean, why,
his word became law, and thus Flora escaped the dreadful infliction.
 </p><p> Now the delicious " lambs' wool" was handed round. As many of
our readers, particularly the gentler kind, may not be aware of the
mysteries of lambs' wool, we will explain how this exquisite beverage is
concocted; a number of apples are tied to the end of a number of
strings, and are then hung up to roast before a blazing fire; under each
apple stands a tankard of ripe delicious ale, well seasoned with sugar,
spice, and nutmeg; when the apples are done thoroughly, they drop from
the strings, and having fallen into the ale, it is then ready for drinking.
The real name is supposed to have been la mas ubhal, that is, the
day of the apple fruit, but being pronounced lamasool, our English
tongues soon corrupted it to lambs' wool.
 </p><p> After some few dozens of the tankards of lambs' wool had passed
from lip to lip, the merriment increased prodigiously, and a general
dance took place. Even the merchant and his Alyce were not permitted to decline joining in this part of the delights of a Christmas-eve.
Nor did Edward and Anne refuse; but the happiest and merriest couple
there, was Flora and her newly-made husband.
  </p><p>All seemed joy around, so while they are thus happily engaged we
will let fall the curtain upon OLD LONDON BRIDGE.

 </p><p> "And is that the end ?" we think we hear more than one fair reader
say; " it is really quite abominable of these authors-they never will
tell all one would wish to know. I, for one, should have liked to have
known whether the old man did get his brother's property-and what
became of the property that Horton stole from Sir Filbut Fussy-and
what became also of Lord Talbot-but most of all, I should like to
have known a little of the after-lives of Edward and Anne, for if it be
really true, that the autograph of Edward Osborne is still to be seen at
the British Museum, it would appear he must have become some one of
consequence, or that some one of consequence became so through him."
</p><p>  These few queries, gentle reader, shall be answered. First, the old
man did get his brother's property, and lived many years to enjoy it, in
the Cottage on the Heath, and many a visit did the lovely Anne pay
him there; the stolen property of Sir Filbut was never discovered;
Lord Talbot, in due course, became the Earl of Shrewsbury, and continued an intimate friend of Sir William Hewet, (for he was knighted after
being Lord Mayor,) and when Sir William died, so says his will, he left
the earl a ring with his initials engraved thereon, W.H. That the earl
proposed for the hand of Hewet's daughter, may be found recorded in
Pennant's London, where after describing the heroic conduct of Hewet's
apprentice, Edward Osborne, he has words to this effect-" That the hand
of Hewet's daughter was greatly sought after when she became marriageable; amongst others who offered, was the Earl of Shrewsbury; but the
merchant replied to all, that ' Osborne had saved her, and that Osborne
should enjoy her."
  </p><p> Sir William Hewet, at his death, besides the ring to the earl, left a
fortune of &#x00A3;6000 a year, the greater portion of which came to Edward
Osborne; he also left the Clothworkers' Company &#x00A3;15 to provide a
dinner for the Livery attending his funeral; and 6s. 8d. for every
maiden of his native place who should be married during the first year
after his decease.
 </p><p>  Edward's after-life was one of unvarying happiness and success; he
became Lord Mayor of London, in <date value="1583">1583</date>, when he received knighthood.
After the death of Sir William Hewet, Osborne and his sweet Anne
resided in the merchant's mansion in Philpot Lane.
  </p><p> Now we feel quite convinced, although our gentle readers do not like
to ask the question, that the setting down the number of children they
had, will be a piece of information not at all unacceptable; well then,
they had five, two sons and three daughters. Hewet Osborne, one of
the sons, was knighted by the Earl of Essex during the war in Ireland;
the other son's name was Edward, who never married. Two of the
daughters' names were Anne and Alyce; the name of the third we have
not been able to discover. The great-grandson of our hero, was Sir
Thomas Osborne, who was raised to the peerage by King Charles the
Second, as Viscount Latimer, and Baron Kiveton; he next was created
Earl of Danby, then Marquis of Carmarthen, and on  <date value="1694-05-04">May 4,1694</date>,
became the first Duke of Leeds. The present Duke of Leeds is a lineal
descendant of our Edward of Old London Bridge.</p><p>

           <head>   PETER OF COLECHURCH</head>

<p>
OF this priest architect whose name must still be revered as the builder
of the first stone bridge that ever crossed the river Thames, but little is
known.   It appears according to the account given by that learned antiquary, Thompson, in his Chronicles of London Bridge, page 45, that
Peter was "a priest and chaplain of St. Mary Colechurch, an edifice,
which, until the great fire of London, stood on the north side of the
Poultry, at the south end of a turning denominated Conyhoop Lane,
from a poulterer's shop having the sign of three conies hanging over it.
This chapel, of which the skilful Peter was curate, was dedicated to
the Blessed Virgin, and famous as the place where St. Edmund and
St. Thomas a Beckett were presented at the baptismal font."
 </p><p> His great work, which has brought his name so honourably down to
our own times, was began in <date value="1176">1176</date>. It took thirty-three years to complete; but the architect had died in the year <date value="1205">1205</date>, so that he never
had the satisfaction of viewing his finished work. His body was buried
in the chapel on the Bridge, which chapel was dedicated to St. Thomas
a Beckett, and was familiarly called St. Thomas of the Bridge.
</p><p>  A more particular account of this famous Bridge will be found in the
course of the Romance.
</p><p>  In <date value="1737">1737</date>, the chapel on the Bridge was occupied by a Mr. Yaldwin,
as a dwelling and warehouse; and in this year, while repairing the
staircase leading to the lower chapel, he discovered the remains of a body,
supposed to be those of Peter of Colechurch.
</p><p>  The last arch of Peter's Bridge was not destroyed until the latter end
of the year <date value="1832">1832</date>. The present London Bridge was opened to the
public,  <date value="1831-08-01">August 1st,1831</date>.
 </p><p> When we regard the miserable state of Westminster Bridge, dying,
as we may say, of premature old age, for it has stood only about a hundred years, our admiration of Peter's gigantic effort, is surprisingly
increased; for, notwithstanding the imperfect knowledge of civil engineering in his day, he yet constructed an edifice, which was not only
regarded as one of the wonders of the world, but which stood the
unceasing attacks of nearly a million of raging floods, during six entire
centuries.  The powerfully-destructive rush of waters may be easily
conceived, when it is remembered that the river itself was no less than
nine hundred feet wide, yet, at every rising and falling of the tide, it
had to find its course through a water-way of only one hundred and
ninety-four feet, caused by the thickness of the stone piers, and the piles,
or sterlings, driven round them to prevent their foundations from being
washed away</p>
