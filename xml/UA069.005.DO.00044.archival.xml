<p>
<quote>     In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease,
    Sprung the rank weed, and thrived with large increase;
    When love was all an easy monarch's care,
    Seldom at council, never in a war;
    Jilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ;
    Nay, wits had pensions, and young lords had wit;
    The fair sat panting at a courtier's play,
    And not a mask went unimproved away;
    The modest fan was lifted up no more,
    And virgins smiled at what they blushed before.</quote>
                       Pope: Essay on Criticism.
</p>
 <p> In the earlier volumes of this series of " English
History from Contemporary Writers " the editors
have been compelled by scantiness of material to
draw their quotations from three or four authors,
the only ones who, as regarded the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries, could be called contemporary.
More fortunate than they, I have had a much larger
field from  which to collect, and have endeavoured
to add new authorities to the already well-stocked
hunting grounds of the historian of the Restoration.
In striving to obtain the historical data contained in
this little book as free from the garbled versions of
party feeling as possible, great care has been taken.
Perhaps the most curious matter in the volume is





<pb id="VI" n="VI"/>


that the description of Oliver Cromwell at the
commencement of the work, which pourtrays him so
favourably, should have been written by a Royalist,
and such an expression of opinion has a likelihood
of truth much greater than if it had been included
amongst the fulsome eulogies of a bigoted Roundhead.
 </p><p>  With all these advantages, the method adopted in
this volume has its drawbacks; the introduction of
works, little if at all used before, makes the description of their authors more difficult, and anything like
the succinct and masterly account of Froissart or
Matthew Paris in the first and second volumes of the
series would be impossible. Amongst familiar faces,
however, we recognise our old friend Pepys, who,
since his shorthand diary was intended for the
perusal of none but himself, wrote down nothing but
the truth, and whose position as secretary to the
Admiralty gave him access both to papers and information long since otherwise lost; may we some
day have an editor competent to issue a perfect edition
of him! Pepys' benefits to us are not confined merely
to the diary which bears his name; he left behind
him an enormous collection, in five folio volumes,
of early English ballad poetry, first begun under the
superintendence of lord chancellor Selden, from
which are to a great extent taken Dr. Percy's
Reliques of Ancient Poetry, and which surpass in
value and completeness even the celebrated Roxburghe collection of ballads. After partial blindness
had compelled him to relinquish his shorthand diary,
May 31, <date value="1669">1669</date>, he had the misfortune to be implicated




<pb id="VII" n="VII"/>
in the Popish Plot, and upon an unfounded charge
of conspiracy was committed to the Tower, from
which, however, he was eventually released without
trial and reinstated in his post at the Admiralty,
which he retained till the accession of William III.
and his retirement into private life. He was for two
years president of the Royal Society, and died in <date value="1703">1703</date>.
  </p><p> Some defence must be offered for the selection of
passages from Defoe's " Journal of the Plague Year "
in illustrating the progress of that dreadful epidemic.
Defoe, though not in London itself during the plague,
gathering his information from those who had lived
through the whole of the visitation, and from one
other source, the published bills of mortality, wrote a
narrative which, for vividness of description and
general accuracy of fact, is by far the finest prose work
of its time, not excepting his inimitable " Robinson
Crusoe," which, though based upon Selkirk's story,
contains so little fact and so much of fiction.
  </p><p> For the history of the Great Fire such scanty information has come down to us owing to the burning of
almost all the printing presses in the fire itself, that
the letter of Sir Edward Atkyn, first printed in the
Arch&#x00E6;ologia (vol. xix., p. 105), giving such a short
yet clear description of the progress of the fire, is a
perfect windfall.</p><p>
  Rugge's MS. diary, <dateRange from="1659" to="1672">1659-1672</dateRange>, which, by the way,
has in process of time become shamefully dog-eared
and worn, and the MS. <foreign lang="GREEK">loimografi/a</foreign> of Boghurst-
who actually practised as a physician for the plague
-both of which are preserved in the British Museum,





<pb id="VIII" n="VIII"/>



have been of great assistance.  Clarendon's History
of the Reign of Charles II., printed in <date value="1755">1755</date>, which
was destroyed before publication upon an injunction
granted to the Duchess of Queensbury, and of which
but five or six copies escaped destruction, one in
my possession, another in the British Museum, and
a third, I believe, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford,
is also a work from which much may be learnt.
Most of the quotations from this work to be found in
the present work are taken from the edition of <date value="1792">1792</date>
edited by Mr. Cormick, since it is more generally
accessible. The " M&#x00E9;moires de Grammont," by
Count Anthony Hamilton, certainly truthful, are of
value to the study of the morals which prevailed at
the court of Charles; and the memoirs of Reresby,
Bramston, Sidney, and many others, may be read
with interest by the student.  Quotations may be
found from  the whole of these authors in the
present volume, but space forbids more than a mere
mention of their names in an already too lengthy
preface. " Burnet's History of His Own Time " has
heen used but sparingly, and I should like to point
out to students of this period the advice of von Ranke
in the appendix on Burnet at the end of his " History
of England in the Seventeenth Century," more
especially these words, which cannot be taken too
carefully to heart:-" In historical works of this kind
the personal element will prevail; a man will not
desert in his writings the party to which he belongs
in his life."</p><p>
  For the history of the Treaty of <date value="1676">1676</date> I have used





<pb id="IX" n="IX"/>


a little book called the Secret History of Whitehall,
compiled from the correspondence of a gentleman who
was, we are told, English secretary to Louvois, then
foreign minister of France, and who had access to all
the papers relating to it; he, in letters purporting to
be addressed to an English nobleman, reveals what I
have not the least hesitation in asserting were the
true opinions of the French court, although they are
not authenticated by any name. These anonymous
letters were published in <date value="1717">1717</date> by a gentleman named
Jones, who, in a preface of remarkable strength,
points out the various arguments for their authenticity.
Apart from this they contain unquestionably the
fullest account of the Treaty of <date value="1676">1676</date>, and the
ascendency of the French king over Charles II. that
has come down to us and as such I have used them.
 </p><p> What few extracts it has been possible to make
from the satire of the time have been used with the
greatest readiness on my part, but the more modest
ears of modern readers might shrink from the unvarnished description of the unparalleled licence at
Charles' court, needful as it is to a true appreciation
of the literature and the history, not only of the time,
but of a considerable number of our British titles.
It needs not a close inspection of our English peerage
to see how true Butler's verses were :-</p><p>

<quote>    Most of thy court, in time, much rather
       Than call thee king will call thee father.</quote>

 </p><p>  To those who wish to see Charles and his court in
their true light I may indicate but two or three




<pb id="X" n="X"/>

authors who will effectually bear out my assertion.
Butler's "Court Burlesqued" and "Hudibras," the
works of Dryden, Sir John Denham's poems, particularly " Advice to a Painter," Andrew Marvell's works,
of which the best edition is the splendid one of Mr.
Grosart, and for the debasing influence which the
court exercised upon literature, the poems of the earls
of Rochester, Roscommon, and Dorset, three of the
luminaries of the age.</p><p>
  It is not generally appreciated how strained were
the relations between king and parliament during the
latter half of Charles' reign.  At times little was
wanting to produce a repetition of the fate of
Charles I., or, at least, an anticipation of what
occurred under James II. The somewhat lengthy
extract which has been given from a scarce tract
containing the reports of debate upon the grant of
&#x00A3;600,000 in <date value="1677">1677</date> cannot fail but show how great was
the exasperation of the Commons against the king,
which rumours-but too well founded-of the compacts made by Charles and Louis XIV. had brought
about. The hardly disguised threats, the stringent
acts against Roman Catholics, and the suspicions
with which everything French was regarded, might
have had quite a different ending but for the outlet
provided by the Popish plot, from which, though it
was supposed to be directed against himself, the king
was scarcely excluded. Had there been a civil war
in the reign of Charles II., England might now be
either a republic or a colony of France.
 </p><p>  Last, and perhaps most of all, have I to acknowledge







<pb id="XI" n="XI"/>


the indebtedness I am under, especially in the
matter of dates, to a little book, published in London
by one William Crook, the first edition in <date value="1679">1679</date>, the
second in <date value="1690">1690</date>, and the third in <date value="1710">1710</date>, called the
"Historian's Guide."  Copies of each of the three
editions are preserved in the British Museum, but I
am not aware of any modern historian who has made
use of, with acknowledgment, what is, in its way, a
most interesting contemporary chronicle, which has
not the inconvenience of size, that great drawback to
the use of the newspapers of the time.
  </p><p> To those who shall find fault in the spelling of
certain names, such as Monk, which most certainly
ought to be spelt Munck, I can only say that, with a
few exceptions, I have used the accepted spelling of
proper names and not the haphazard and variable
spellings used indiscriminately by different authorities.</p><p>
  Amongst the many friends whom I have to thank
for assistance in the production of this volume, I
must particularly mention Mr. Bullen, of the British
Museum, to whose kindness I owe the completion of
this work to my own satisfaction, and, I hope, to the
reader's.</p><p>

<p>  When Cromwell died, and his son was owned and
received Protector by some of the officers of the
army, though opposed by others, differences grew.
Fleetwood and Desborough, great men and allied to
that family, yet thought themselves as worthy as Dick
Cromwell; and Lambert, not less ambitious than
they, meant to have the command from them all and
setup for himself; but yet Thurloe and the major
part of Cromwell's counsellors carried [it] for young
Cromwell, alleging it was the old Protector's wish;
and he had possession of the title of Protector, and
addresses came to him acknowledging him for such
from most counties; yet many would endure no
single person. By this means differences grew here.
Monk who commanded in chief in Scotland, and by
building forts and by garbling his army had perfectly
mastered that nation, of which Oliver was jealous,
and in his lifetime had sent for him home, as that he
durst not trust the Scots. Lambert knew he should
not effect his design if Monk stood; and Monk was
certain to be destroyed if Lambert prevailed or
Richard stood.</p>

<head>Monk marches south, his further proceedings.
                                               Ibid.</head>
<p>  Monk first garbled his army, both officers and
soldiers that he anyway had doubt of, or that he could
not absolutely rule, and prevailed with the Scots to
raise money for his journey into England; and
leaving the principal command of those forces he
left behind unto Colonel Morgan (a little man but a
very great soldier), he, with a small army, but well
affected to him marches for England; and having by
his great taciturnity concealed his design, and temporising, fooled Scott and Robinson, two spies sent
from the Rump to discover his design, he came by
easy marches to London, refusing to come into the
city until the other army was removed thence to other
quarters pretending the hazard and danger of quarrels
if both the armies should be mingled in the same
quarters. As he came through the several counties,
he was visited by all parties, the Lord Fairfax amongst
others, who offered him his assistance as did others,
but would [take] none, and he promised a free Parliament to such as desired it. So soon as he came to
London, the Rump sent to him to pull down the city
gates. Monk obeyed their commands and did pull
down the gates; and understanding well what was designed against him by the Rumpers, who resolved to
take the whole command of the army from him, and
make him at most but the third part of a general, he
marched of a sudden with his army out of London into
Westminster, and this made the council of state as they
were called, to scatter and shift for themselves; some




<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>



ran quite away, and Nicholas Love, a barrister of
Lincoln's Inn, who was to be president of the council
at that time, being come to Whitehall and in their
council chamber, made haste and got into some hole,
never heard of again after that I could learn. Monk
calls the secluded members to come to their places
(they were Presbyterians who were thrown out of the
house by Cromwell and the army), which many of
them did; and he appoints out of them a secret
council.  Amongst these was Grimston, Maynard,
Swinfen, old Lenthall, &amp;c.; but he had agreed with
them to dissolve so soon as they had issued writs for
a free Parliament, which all men desired.</p></div2>

<p>  He gave the Parliament good words, for which
they heaped their favours upon him; they voted one
thousand pounds per annum to be settled on him.
And that nothing might be wanting to complete this

out herself to fetch the sweetmeats, and filling out

horse, and the dukes on the right hand of the king

<p>  That which the House of Commons hath done
since I wrote to you last is, that in the Act of Oblivion
they have agreed upon seven in number to be excepted for life and estate, but have not yet named
them; others there are who were of the king's judges
also, but perhaps did not sign the warrant for his
execution, who will be excepted only as to their
estates.

<p>  The king having pressed the expediting of the Act
of Indemnity, and the Houses having an intention
to punish in some degree divers others besides those
seven that were the late king's judges, who are to die,
which would take up much time they have resolved
first to confiscate the estate of all that sat in the High
Court of Justice upon the king, excepting three only,
Hutchinson, Lascelles, and another; and they have
excepted out of the Act twenty more not yet named,
who are to be punished as shall be provided in
another Act not yet made, by fines as is supposed,
in which number I believe you will find Haselrig,
Vane, St. John, Glyn, Maynard, Ellis, and divers
others that have been alive since '48.</p>

<p>  Since my last the House hath been employed
wholly or principally upon naming those persons
they intend shall not have the benefit of the Act of
Indemnity, but of the twenty they except there are
but few named yet, the favour that some of them find
in the House making the debates long. Yesterday
the great debate was concerning the old speaker,
Lenthall, in whose favour the general spoke much;
but upon division of the House the opposers of Lenthall were the major part by eighty; so he will receive




<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>

no benefit by the Act. Sir Harry Vane was excepted
likewise, and found but one (Noe) in the whole House
to favour him. To-day they have excepted one major
general Burton of Norfolk. Luke Robinson was
expelled the House yesterday. Sir Harry Mildmay
is sent for from Dover . . . . and Thurloe hath
been with the king privately, and with the chancellor
since. 'Tis said he will be (as he used to call it
himself) ingenious.</p>

you will find by the book. To-day the proclamation
of pardon to all but those the Houses except was
proclaimed by the heralds in several places. The
House to-day gave the kingtonnage and poundage, and
a Parliament man now tells me that the committee of
religion to-day notes that all ministers that were put
out of their benefices merely for their affection to the
king, and were not otherwise scandalous, should be
restored to their respective cures.

speech of the king's stopped the career they intended,
so that they satisfied themselves with the excepting

that the House of Commons left to the law, and in
estate none shall be punished: these five are Lambert,
Haselrig, Sir H. Vane, Colonel Axtell, and Colonel
Hacker; the four first of these were of the twenty

that the House of Commons intended to punish in

warrant was directed to see the king executed. But
the House of Lords have ordered also that if any of
the remaining sixteen shall hereafter presume to bear
any office, civil, military, or ecclesiastical, that they
shall receive no benefit from the Act of Indemnity;

<p>  Yesterday the Commons showed their reasons why
they could not agree with the Lords in excepting
those of the king's judges that rendered themselves,
and to-day the Lords offered this expedient: that all
the king's judges should be excepted from benefit by
the Bill (in which case they were left to the law which
will certainly condemn them); but that those that
rendered themselves upon the proclamation should

not be executed but by Act of Parliament. Upon
report of this to the Commons, they agreed with the
Lords, and now if the Act can so soon be engrossed,
'tis believed it will be passed by the king on Tuesday
next. Haselrig shall forfeit estate only, Axtell both
life and estate, Lambert and Sir H. Vane are excepted
both for life and estate also, but the Houses will
petition the king to pardon the lives of these two.

<p>  To-day Harrison was the only man tried . . .
he said he had often prayed, with tears, that God
would direct him, and it was revealed to him to be a
just action to put the king to death, who (he said)
had made war against the Parliament and was guilty
of all the bloodshed in the war. When they endeavoured to prove his hand to the warrant for execution,
he wished them not to lose time, and, calling for the
paper, said he believed it to be his hand. The jury

and he was immediately sentenced to be hanged,

die there as he did to commit the act for which he

remorse, and Daniel Axtell who dissolved himself
into tears and prayers for the king and his own soul,
were executed at Tyburn, where Hacker was only
hanged, and his brother Rowland Hacker had his
body entire, which he begged, and Axtell was quartered. The rest of the condemned rebels are returned

<head>Conference between the bishops and Presbyterian
ministers, and what happened whilst it was sitting.
                      Andrew Newport to Sir R. Leveson.
                          Oct. 23, <date value="1660">1660</date>, London.</head>
<p>  Yesterday a conference was held before the king
at the lord chancellor's betwixt the bishops and
Presbyterian ministers concerning church government; the Presbyterians agreed to an episcopal
government, but they would not have the bishops






<pb id="p.33" n="33"/>



have any power but jointly with the Presbyters and
with their consent.  At last they agreed that the
bishop should act with the advice and assistance
of his prebends and six ministers of his diocese.
The Presbyterians pleaded much for power of suspension from the communion to be given to ministers,
but that would not be granted, and they yielded at
last that power only to the bishops and his assistants
(as above); some liberty is given them to forbear
some ceremonies if they please. Some parts of the
Common Prayer (which are particularly mentioned)
they must use, other parts they have liberty in, and
some others are to have some small alteration ; they
are agreed in all matters and very suddenly. A
declaration of church government will be set out.
During this conference Mrs. Hyde fell in labour and
notice being given of it, the king sent for the lady
Ormond, lady Sunderland, and lady Cork; these
with some bishops were commanded to be present
at the labour, and to ask her (as they did) whose
child it was; she said the duke of York's; they
further asked her if she were married; she said she
was (to the duke); they asked her also if any other
man had known her, and with many imprecations she
said none; thus the matter rests . . Mrs. Hyde's
child is a boy.</p></div2>

you think it would be for the benefit of the king that

<p>  I can now assure you that which is not yet confessed, and hath so long been the great dispute of
the Court, I mean whether the duke would own his
wife. I dare now give you my word he will, and that
she shall be acknowledged duchess of York as soon
as the queen is gone, whose journey begins the
twenty-sixth of this month. The queen is grieved
much at it, and thinks there was never more want of
the Pope's power here than upon this occasion.

the rest to be spoken by the lord high chancellor,
who (according to custom) excellently set forth the
happiness of his Majesty and his people, who only
strive which should express most affection to each
other, to the joy of all good men and the terror of
all that refuse their own happiness by thoughts of
embroiling the kingdom in blood, whose designs

was dissolved, but will never be forgotten for the
good it had done (by the mercies of God) to this

<p>  By this time you expect some particulars of the
death of that great peer of Scotland James, marquis
of Argyll, of whose trial and condemnation we formerly told you.  And (to do him right) we must
confess his whole carriage all along his execution
was as if it were true which some have confidently
reported of him, that he has long known he should
certainly be executed. For the night he was sentenced he supped as at other times   .... On
Monday (the day of his execution) he eat a full meal,
and soon after (which was about three in the afternoon) the bailiffs of Edinburgh sent their officer to
let him know that his hour was more than past:
whereupon he drank a glass of wine and came away,
cocking his beaver more than usually. . . When
he came near the Mercat Cross, where the scaffold
was planted, he looked upon the maiden, so in Scotland they call the axe [sic], once or twice .
He looked several ways upon the people  . . then
prayed. . . His speech was short. . . When
he had done speaking he took the paper wherein his
speech was written and tore it into six pieces and
gave it to six of his friends, and then (without more
ado) he laid his head on the block, where at one
blow his head was severed from his body.</p>

<p>  The putting Sir Henry Vane to death . . was . .
much blamed: for the declaration from Breda being
full for an indemnity to all, except the Regicides,
he was comprehended in that; since though he was
for changing the government, and deposing the king,
yet he did not approve of the putting him to death,
nor of the force put on the Parliament, but did for
some time, while these things were acted, withdraw

<p>  The business then in agitation was concerning the
sale of Dunkirk. The Spaniards pretended it ought
to be restored to them, since it was taken from them
by Cromwell, when they had the king and his brother
in their armies: but this was not much regarded.
The French pretended, that, by their agreement with
Cromwell, he was only to hold it, till they had repaid
the charge of the war: therefore they, offering to lay
that down, ought to have the place delivered to them.
The king was in no sort bound by this.  So the
matter under debate was, whether it ought to be kept
or sold ? The military men, who were believed to be
corrupted by France, said, the place was not tenable;
that in time of peace it would put the king to a great
charge and in time of war it would not quit the cost
of keeping it. The earl of Clarendon said, he understood




             <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>

 not those matters; but appealed to Monk's
 judgment, who did positively advise the letting it go
 for the sum that France offered
 Schomberg advised that the king should keep it;
     . . and he was sure it could never be taken, as
 long as England was master of the sea.
 But he was singular in that opinion. So it was sold,
 and all the money that was paid for it was immediately squandered amongst the mistress's creatures.

<p>   It was about the middle of September, <date value="1664">1664</date>, that
 I heard that the plague was returned again in Hol land. . . The Government had a true account of
 it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private.
 Hence it was that this rumour died off again.
 till the latter end of November or beginning of December, <date value="1664">1664</date>, when two men, said to be Frenchmen,
 died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather in the
 upper end of Drury Lane. . . The people showed
 a great concern at this, and began to be alarmed all
 over the town, and the more because in the last week
 in December, <date value="1664">1664</date>, another man died in the same
 house and of the same distemper; and then we were
 easy for about six weeks . . . but after that, I
 think it was about the 12th of February, another died
 in another house, but in the same parish and in the
 same manner . . . and the weekly bills showing
 an increase of burials in St. Giles's parish more than
 usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was
 among the people.   . . The usual number of
 burials within the bills of mortality for a week was
 from about 240 or thereabouts to 300. The last was
 esteemed a pretty high bill ; but after this we found
the bills successively increasing as follows:</p>

<p><table rows="6" cols="2">
<row role="labels"><cell>Date Ranges </cell><cell>Buried</cell></row>
<row role="data"><cell>Dec. 20 to Dec. 27 </cell><cell>291</cell> </row>

</p>


                   <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>

<p>  This last bill was really frightful, being a larger
number than had been known to have been buried
in one week since the preceding visitation of <date value="1636">1636</date> !
</p><p>  However, all this went off again, and, the weather
proving cold . . . the bills decreased . . .
and everybody began to look upon the danger as good
as over . . . but it returned again, and the distemper spread into two or three other parishes. .
</p><p>. This was the beginning of May, yet the weather
was temperate, variable, and cool enough, and people
had still some hopes.  . . We continued in these
hopes for a few days, but it was but for a few, for
</p><p>  . in the weekly bill next week the thing began
to show itself. There was, indeed, but fourteen set
down of the plague, but this was all knavery and
collusion . . . and we took it for granted that
there were fifty died that week of the plague .  .
The second week in June the parish of St. Giles,
where  .   . . the weight of the infection lay,
buried 120, whereof, though the bills said but sixty-
eight of the plague, everybody said there had been
100 at least, calculating it from the usual number of
funerals in that parish. . . The court removed
early, viz., in the month of June, and went to
Oxford, where it pleased God to preserve them.

<p>  The plague is a most acute disease, for though
some died in eight, ten, or twenty days after they had
been sick, yet the greatest part died before five or
six days, and in the summer about half that were
sick died, but towards winter three parts in four
lived, but none died suddenly, as stricken by lightning or an apoplexy.

<p>Journal of the Plague Year, ed. <date value="1835">1835</date>, pp. 62, 63, 73, 146, 148.
  About June the lord mayor of London and the
court of aldermen  .... began more particularly to concern themselves for the regulation of the
city.
</p><p>  The justices of the peace for Middlesex, by direction of the secretary of State, had begun to shut up
houses in the parish of St. Giles'-in-the-Fields, St.
Martin, St. Clement Danes, &amp;c., and it was with
good success, for in several streets where the plague
broke out, upon strict guarding the houses that were
infected and taking care to bury those that died
immediately after they were known to be dead, the
plague ceased in those streets. It was also observed




<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>

that the plague decreased sooner in those parishes
than it did in the parishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, Whitechapel, Stepney, and others,
the early care taken in that manner being a great
means to putting a check to it. . . This shutting
up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and
unchristian method, and the poor people so confined
made bitter lamentations. Complaints of the severity
of it were also daily brought to my lord mayor of
houses causelessly (and some maliciously) shut up.
. . . One of the worst days we had in the whole
time, as I thought, was in the beginning of September,
when, indeed, good people began to think that God
was resolved to make a full end of the people in
this miserable city. This was at that time when the
plague was fully come into the eastern parishes.
The parish of Aldgate, if I may give my opinion,
buried above a thousand a week for two weeks,
though the bills did not say so many; but it surrounded me at so dismal a rate that there was not
a house in twenty uninfected. In the Minories, in
Houndsditch, and in those parts of Aldgate parish
about Butcher Row and the alleys over against me,
I say in those places, death reigned in every corner.
Whitechapel parish was in the same condition, and
though much less than the parish I lived in, yet
buried near six hundred a week by the bills, and in
my opinion near twice as many. Whole families, and,
indeed, whole streets of families were swept away
together; insomuch, that it was frequent for neighbours to call to the bellman to go to such and such




             <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>

houses and fetch out the people, for that they were
all dead. . . . I suppose the world has heard of
the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast; he, though
not affected at all but in the head, went about denouncing of judgment upon the city in a frightful
manner, sometimes quite naked and with a pan of
burning charcoal on his head.

should be offered thereby to infest the Turks, which
the king consented to, and sent orders accordingly;
but the Dutch had no such purpose; his business
was to ransom the captives with money, and not to
exact the delivery of them by force, and to make an
accommodation for the time to come as well as he
could, and when the English fleet was at any time in

stop to their flight, which they easily might have
done, they rather assisted than obstructed their

</p><p>   I received your letter, and shall give you the best
account I can of our late sad fire, though it is scarcely
possible for any man fully to describe it. It began
in a baker's house in Pudding Lane, near Thames





<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>

Street, on Sunday morning, about two or three of the
clock, and burnt down several houses, but could not
be quenched, in regard it was a narrow place where
the engines could not play, and the Lord Mayor did
not think fit to pull down any houses to prevent the
further spreading of the fire. About ten of the clock
whilst we were at church there was a cry in the
streets that the Dutch and French were in arms, and
had fired the city, and thereupon the ministers dismissed their several congregations, but we that were
so remote thought little of it. In the afternoon I
went into the Temple Garden, where I saw it had
made an unhappy progress, and had consumed
towards the Thames side many houses and two or
three churches, as Lawrence Pountney church, which
I saw strangely fired, and other churches, and at last
growing somewhat violent and meeting with many
wharfs, and the wind being high, it grew very formidable, and we began to think of its nearer approach.
By Monday morning it had burnt all Thames Street,
New Fish Street, and some part of Cannon Street,
and thereupon the citizens began to neglect the fire
and to secure their goods, and in fine and to be short,
by Wednesday evening it had burnt all the city.
Yesterday I went from  St. Dunstan's Church to
Bishopsgate Street, and there is not one house
standing betwixt those places; there are only, within
the wall, but part of these three streets remaining,
viz., part of Leadenhall Street, Pasinghall and
Bishopsgate Street, all the rest burnt to the ground,
and not so much as a considerable piece of timber,





                            <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

as I could see, secured from the fire. It is impossible
almost to conceive the total destruction; all the
churches burnt, nay, some of the churches as Bow
Church  . . . have not so much as the walls
standing.  All the halls, as Guildhall, Merchant
Taylors' Hall, Mercers' Chapel, Old Exchange, burnt
down to the ground, so that you can hardly tell where
such a parish or place was. I can say but this, that
there is nothing but stones and rubbish, and all
exposed to the open air. So that you may see from
one end of the city almost to the other. St. Paul's
Church the very stones are crumbled and broken to
shivers . . . and you can compare London (were
it not for the rubbish) to nothing more than an open
field. The citizens were forced to remove their
goods into the open fields, and &#x00A3;10 a cart was now
demanded to carry away the goods. The Inner
Temple almost burnt and pulled down, except the
Temple Church, the Hall much defaced, and the
Exchequer Office, Serjeant's Inn in Fleet Street, and
all to St. Dunstan's Church, and so on the other side
of Holborn Bridge. The king and duke of York
were exceedingly active, or otherwise I doubt that
the suburbs had undergone the same calamity: some
have conceived that it was a plot, but most and the
king himself believe that it was only the hand of
God. The king comforts the citizens with the rebuilding of the city, but God knows when that will
be; the Exchange is now kept at Gresham College,
where I heard yesterday there was a full exchange of
merchants. . . Chancery Lane is yet standing






<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>
except the St. John's Head near Lincoln's Inn,
which was pulled down, by way of prevention, and
another house towards Holborn. . . Houses are
now at an excessive rate. . . I believe the danger
is well over, only we have frequent false alarms of
fire, sometimes in one place, and then in another;
it now burns only in cellars and warehouses, where
either coals, spirits, or other combustible matters
were lodged.

</p><p>  The time when it began  . . .was about three
of the clock on a Sunday morning, a time when most
persons, especially of the poorer sort, were but newly
in bed and in their first deep sleep. . . The
place wherein it first began . . was Pudding Lane
</p><p>     . . this little pitiful lane, crowded behind Little
Eastcheap on the west, St. Botolph's Lane on the
east, and Thames Street on the south of it was the
place where the fire originated, and that forwarded
by a baker's stack of wood in the house, and by all
the neighbouring houses, which were as so many
matches to kindle and carry it on . . . thus the
fire meeting with the Star Inn on Fish Street Hill on
the back of it, and that inn full of hay and other
combustibles, and with the houses opposite to it, and
closed with it at the top, burned three ways at once,
into Thames Street (the lodge of all combustibles,

heavy goods being warehoused there near the water
side) . . . and in all this savage progress met
with no opposition from engines or other artifices
</p><p>    . . There being no rain of a long time before
the fire, and both the springs low and the waterworks
at the Bridgefoot which carried water into that part
of the city burnt down the first day of the fire . . .
This . . . fire took into its possession 81 parish
churches and at least six or seven chapels and other
churches answerable to them, amongst which the
famous cathedral of St. Paul was one, so incinerating
the glory and emasculating the vigour and firmness
of them that the standing walls are (for the most
part) unable to bear new roofs, the sturdy supporters
of them being enervated, the monuments in them
burnt to powder, the bells in the steeples melted,
the vaults underneath pierced, the stones of the outside so scaled as if the fire was greedy to eat out all
firmness in them.

<head>The Dutch burn Sheerness and sail up the Thames.</head>
<p>      Clarendon's Hist. of Charles II., vol. ., , p. 339, et seq.
  About the beginning of June De Ruyter came with
the fleet out of the Weelings, and,   joining with the
rest from the Texel, sailed from the coast of England,
and having a fair wind , stood for the river of Thames.
</p><p>     .There had been much discourse all that year
of erecting a fort at Sheerness for the defence of the
river, and the king had made two journeys thither in
the winter, and had given such orders to the commissioners of the ordnance for the overseeing and
finishing the fortification that everybody believed
the work done   . . . but whatever had been
thought or directed, very little had been done;
there were a company or two of very good soldiers
there under excellent officers, but the fortifications
so weak and unfinished, and all other provisions
so entirely wanting that the Dutch fleet no sooner
approached within a distance, but with their cannon
they beat all their works flat and drove the men from
the ground. . .   here was indeed no danger of
their landing, and they were too wise to think of it,
their business was an element they had more confidence in and more power upon, they had good
intelligence how loosely all things were left in the
river, and therefore as soon as the tide came to help
them they stood full up the river without any consideration of the chain [which had been placed
across the river], which their ships immediately broke
in pieces and broke without the least pause. . .
There were two or three ships of the royal navy





<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>

negligently, if not treacherously, left in the river
which might have been very easily drawn into safety,
and could be of no imaginable use in the place where
they then were; . . . all those ships and some
merchantmen laden and ready to put to sea were
presently in a flame; the Dutch, knowing that they
could not carry them off, giving order to burn them
</p><p>    . . . but they thought they had done enough,
and   . . .made use of the ebb to carry them
back again.

Shaming our warlike island's ancient glory:
A scene which never on our seas appeared,
Since our first ships were on the ocean steered;
Make the Dutch fleet, while we supinely sleep,
Without opposers, masters of the deep:
Make them securely the Thames' mouth invade,
At once depriving us of that and trade:
Draw thunder from their floating castles, sent
Against our forts, weak as our government:
Draw Woolwich, Deptford, London, and the Tower
Meanly abandoned to a foreign power.

<p>  The king did not fall short of any of his subjects
either in figure or air. His character was agreeable,
his temper easy and affable.  His soul, susceptible of
opposite impressions, was compassionate to the unhappy, relentless to the wicked, and tender to excess.
He was able when pressing affairs called for capacity,
when the affairs were not pressing he could apply
himself no longer.    His heart was often the dupe
but more often the slave of his engagements.

<p>  The duke of York was very different [from the
king] in character. He had a reputation for undaunted courage; a religious observance of his word;
economy in his affairs; application, haughtiness and
pride each in their turn. A scrupulous observer of
the ties of duty and the laws of justice; he was
counted a faithful friend, and an implacable enemy.
</p><p>  His morality and justice for some time struggling
with his convenience, had at last triumphed, when he

to the Princess Royal, whom he had secretly married
in Holland.   Her father, from  that time Prime
Minister of England, supported by this new alliance,
soon saw himself at the head of affairs and had
almost ruined them. He wanted not capacity: but
he had more presumption.</p>

Buckingham, Hamilton, Fitz-Harding, to whom he
hath, it seems, given &#x00A3;12,000 per annum in the best
part of the king's estate; and that the old duke of
Buckingham could never get of the king. Progers
[the king's valet de chambre] is another, and Sir H.
Bennett [afterwards lord Arlington]. He loves not
the queen at all but is rather sullen to her; and she
by all reports incapable of children. He is so fond
of the duke of Monmouth that everybody admires
[i.e. wonders at] it; and he says that the duke hath
said that he would be the death of any man that
says the king was not married to his mother [Lucy
Walters]; though Allsopp says it is well known that
she was a common strumpet before the king was
acquainted with her. But it seems he says that the
king is mighty fond of these bastard children; and

</p><p>  My lord Southampton, Lord High Treasurer of
England, being lately dead, the administration of
that great office was transacted by four commissioners: the duke of Albemarle, lord Ashley Cooper
(afterwards earl of Shaftesbury), Sir William Coventry
(secretary to the duke of York), and Sir John Duncomb. It was now that the Parliament fell upon
the great earl of Clarendon, who, having surrendered
the seals a few months afterwards, as much as possible
to avoid the heat of his enemies, retired privately into
France. His greatest enemy in the House of Lords
was the duke of Buckingham; in the House of
Commons, Sir Thomas Osborne. since earl of
Danby; by this step, and by the help of his grace
the duke of Buckingham, who was now absolute
favourite, it was that Sir Thomas more especially
rose to the height of his dignity.
</p><p>  The duke of Buckingham   now acted as Prime
Minister. The king consulted him chiefly in all
concerns of moment; the foreign ministers were to
apply to him before they could be admitted to an
audience. But he was such a foe to business, such
a friend to pleasure, and so apt to turn the day into
night and the night into day, that he could neither
attend regularly on the king, nor dispatch business,
as it ought to be, with those who had anything to
negotiate with him ; so his ministry proved of no
long duration.</p>

<p>  Burnet: Hist. of his own Times, Oxford, <date value="1823">1823</date>, vol. i, p. 452.
</p><p>  The duke of Buckingham pressed the king to own
a marriage with the duke of Monmouth's mother
[Lucy Walters] and he undertook to get witnesses to
attest it. The duke of York told me, in general,
that there was much talk about it; but he did not
descend to particulars. The earl of Carlisle offered
to begin the matter in the House of Lords. The
king would not consent to this ; yet he put it in such
a manner as made them all conclude that he wished
it might be done, but he did not know how to bring
it about. These discourses were all carried to the
duke of Monmouth, and got fatally into his head.
When the duke talked of this matter to me, in the
year seventy-three, I asked him if he thought the
king had still the same inclinations ? He said he
believed not: he thought the duke of Monmouth
had not spirit enough to think of it; and he commended the duchess of Monmouth so highly as
to say to me that the hopes of a crown could not
work on her to do an unjust thing. I thought he
gave that matter too much countenance, by calling
the duke of Monmouth nephew; but he said it
pleased the king. When the party saw they could
make nothing of the business of the duke of Monmouth, they tried next by what methods they could
get rid of the queen; that so the king might marry
another wife, for the king had children by so many
different creatures, that they hoped for issue if he
had a wife capable of any. Some thought the queen





                   <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

and he were not legally married; but the avowing
of a marriage, and the living many years in that
state did certainly supply any defect in point of
form.  Others pretended she was barren from a
natural cause. . . . But the king often said he
was sure she had once miscarried. This, though
not overthrown by such an evidence, could never be
proved; unless the having no children was to be
concluded barrenness: and the dissolving a marriage
on such an account could neither be justified in law
nor conscience. Other stories were given out of the
queen's person, which were false: for I saw in a
letter under the king's own hand, that the marriage
was consummated.   Others talked of polygamy:
and officious persons were ready to thrust themselves
into anything that would contribute to their advancement   ...... All such propositions would
throw us into great convulsions; and entail war upon
us if any issue came from a marriage so grounded.

</p><p>  <date value="1668">1668</date>.-At this time the court fell into much extravagance in masquerading ; both king and queen,
and all the court went about masked, and came into
houses unknown and danced there with a great deal
of wild frolic. In this all people were so disguised
that without being on the secret none could distinguish them. They were carried about in hackney
chairs.  Once the queen's chairmen, not knowing
who she was, went from her: so she was alone and




<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>

was much disturbed, and came to Whitehall in a
hackney coach: some say it was in a cart. The
duke of Buckingham proposed to the king that he
would give him leave to steal her away, and send her
to a plantation where she should be well and carefully looked to, but never heard of any more; so it
should be given out she had deserted; and upon
that it would fall in with some principles to carry an
act for a divorce, grounded upon the pretext of a
wilful desertion. Sir Robert Murray told me, that
the king himself rejected this with horror. He said
it was a wicked thing to make a poor lady miserable,
only because she was his wife and had no children by
him, which was no fault of hers. The hints of this
broke out: for the duke of Buckingham could conceal nothing. And upon that the earl of Manchester,
then Lord Chamberlain, told the queen, it was neither
decent nor safe for her to go about in such a manner
as she had done of late: so she gave it over. But at
last all these schemes settled in a proposition, into
which the king went; which was to deal with the
queen's confessor that he might persuade her to leave
the world and to turn religious; upon which the
parliament would have been easily prevailed on to
pass a divorce. It was believed that upon this the
duchess of York sent an express to Rome with the
notice of her conversion ; and that orders were sent
from Rome to all about the queen to persuade her
against such a proposition, if any should suggest it to
her. She herself had no mind to be a nun, and the
duchess was afraid of seeing another queen : and the




                                   <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>

mistress, created at that time duchess of Cleveland,
knew that she must be the first sacrifice to a beloved
queen ; an  she reconciled herself upon this to the
duchess of York.

<p>  The duke of Buckingham upon that broke with
her and studied to take the kingdom from her by
new amours; and because he thought a gaiety of
humour would take much with the king, he engaged
him to entertain two players, one after another,
Davies and Gywnne. The first did not keep her hold
long; but Gwynne, the indiscreetest and wildest
creature that ever was in a court, continued to the
end of the king's life in great favour, and was maintained at a vast expense. The duke of Buckingham
told me that when she was first brought to the king,
she asked only five hundred pounds a year and the
king refused it. But, when he told me this about
four years after, he said she had got of the king above
sixty thousand pounds.  She acted all persons in so
lively a manner and was such a constant diversion to
the king, that even a new mistress could not drive
her away. . . .    The king had another mistress
that was managed by lord Shaftesbury, who was the
daughter of a clergyman, Roberts; in whom her first
education had so deep a root, though she fell into
many scandalous disorders, with very dismal adventures in them all, yet a principle of religion was so
deep laid in her, that though it did not restrain her,




<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>
yet it kept alive in her a constant horror of sin that
she was never easy in an ill course and died with a
great sense of her former ill life. The duchess of
Cleveland, finding that she had lost the king, abandoned herself to great disorders, one of which, by
the artifice of the duke of Buckingham, was discovered by the king in person, the party concerned

<p>         Secret Hist. of Whitehall, <date value="1717">1717</date>, vol i., p. 45, et seq.
</p><p>  The French Court having  .    .... gained
the duke of Buckingham entirely to their interests,
they began now to conceive some hopes to bring our
king to join with them against the States, at least
with his naval power, of which they had most need;
and therefore to strike while the iron was hot they
deliberated of sending over an ambassador of their
own into England to negotiate the matter: but to
colour the intrigue as if they had no design of their
own thereby, and to give no matter of jealousy to
their neighbours, especially the United Provinces, it
was agreed it should be a female ambassadress, the
king's fair sister Henrietta Maria, duchess of Orleans,
and so give out at the same time she went over
purely on a visit to her royal brothers; and that it
was with some seeming reluctancy the French king




<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>

upon her earnest application to him to that purpose
gave his consent.  But she was furnished with
such proposals which they knew well that sent her
none could with equal safety and privacy advance,
nor none with equal power and influence recommend.
And to secure the whole transaction from the very
suspicion as well as penetration of any not of their
cabal, and to make it appear a pure visit and the
effect of natural affection and void of all intrigue,
her return was limited to so short a time and in so
peremptory and notorious a manner that it might
induce the world to believe them too suspicious of
the natural inclinations that the princess might still
retain for her royal brothers, and for the wealth of
her and their native country, so incompatible with
the exorbitant grandeur of France, to entrust her
with any of the mysterious arcana of their politics;
and so might prevent all jealousy in England, at that
critical juncture of that interview, by showing so great
an apprehension of it themselves. She was charged
with the same message partly, and with some of the
same arguments, which they had endeavoured to
insinuate by the duke of Buckingham: but having
an incomparable advantage above him, or any
other ambassador to back whatsoever she advanced
with all the charms that a most accomplished and
lovely princess, as an only and most beloved sister,
could be armed with; she who had wit and dexterity
enough to manage those privileges to the utmost
advantage, not only pressed the said matter more
home and with infinitely more freedom and efficacy,




         <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>

but adventured to propose yet higher things, and of
a much more extended consequence. For addressing
her speech to the king (though not without intermixing some expressions equally affecting also to her
brother the duke of York) she told his Majesty, that
as she hoped neither of her royal brothers had any
reason to call in question her natural affection to
their persons, so she believed they had as little cause
to doubt but she could see as far as another into the
French monarch's heart, who loved her and admired
her to that degree, though innocently, as gave no
small umbrage to Monsieur his brother and her
husband; and that she did sincerely represent both
as his most Christian Majesty's sense and her own
that the only way to secure to his Majesty and the
present Royal Family of England a stability in the
throne they were lately restored to, after so dismal
an overthrow of the monarchy, in the reign and
person of their unhappy father, and to reinstate the
majesty of the British kings in its former splendour
and security enjoyed so long and gloriously in
Catholic times, was by all wise and politic means to
labour to introduce into these kingdoms the Catholic
religion and to reassume by degrees absolute power.
For that the Church of England by woeful experience
had been found too weak alone to defend the Crown,
and that the dissenters were so stiffly principled for
a commonwealth, that they would never leave till
they had once more overturned the monarchy unless
his Majesty would timely provide for his security by
methods to be proposed to him by her and the most





<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>

Christian king who she knew had the utmost tenderness for his interest, as was clear enough by all
expressions of his real inclinations, since they were
emancipated from the restraints laid upon them
under the tutelage of a cardinal who was a master in
pure politics, and altogether unacquainted with those
nobler and more heroic sentiments of honour and
generosity which are no less natural and inextinguishable in a born prince than common reason is in
the rest of mankind. The chief of which expedients
were flattering of the Church of England, and first
persecuting by Act of Parliament the Protestant
dissenters and wheedling with them again by a prerogative lenative; and so by the not to be questioned
acceptance of the suffering Protestants on the one
hand and the no less assured non-opposition of those
of the Established Church on the other, as by an
irresistible charm to lay asleep that watchful dragon
that had so long kept the golden apples of contention
between the king and people from the ravishment of
the most enterprising monarch and break that mischievous devil that had of late been so busy in
asserting pretended liberties, and advance the sovereignty of old hateful laws above the more sacred
majesty of the princes, the only rightful legislators,
whilst the Crown as securely as unregardedly might
seize and, seizing for all perpetuity, appropriate as
to itself the important jewel of dispensing power,
which would fix and fasten the whole chaplet of
unbounded sovereignty by making use of that popular
relaxation, to indulge the faction esteemed the most




             <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

dangerous to the monarchy and to decoy them into
a favouring of those encroachments upon the laws
and upon the people's fundamental rights, and therein
the legislation, who seemed of all men the most
deeply principled against them, and so in effect to
make those very persons the tools for the erection of
absolute and despotic sway who otherwise could
hardly be reconciled to the most just, most legal, and
most moderate Royalty. So far were the measures
to be observed at home, and those which she and
their brother of France advised to be used abroad,
were-</p>
<p>  1. To endeavour by all possible means the subversion of the Republic of Holland, the perpetual source
of rebellion in England.
</p><p>  2. In order with so much the more expedition,
certainty, and safety to effect the reduction both of
his own people and of that untoward neighbouring
nest and receptacle of plotters and rebels, to resolve
upon a firm and inviolable adherence to the interests
of the most Christian king, who in that case would
no way desert him, but vigorously and powerfully aid
him, and carry him through all difficulties. But in
case, added she, his Majesty could not satisfy his
conscience well enough to attempt any such change
in religion (as she just now had mentioned) or notwithstanding all remonstrances to the contrary should
continue over-persuaded of the too great difficulty or
impracticableness of such an enterprise; that however as a Protestant of the Church of England, which
was firm to monarchy, if he desired to put himself





<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>

into a condition to protect that, and that reciprocally
to defend him and his successors in time to come,
it would be absolutely necessary for him at least to
concur with his most Christian Majesty in subduing
the Republic of Holland. That besides the advantage of such a repartition of the conquered country,
as he could reasonably expect, he should find upon
the reduction of it that the Commonwealth section
in England and her two sister kingdoms would
dwindle away of itself, and so the king would not
only become absolute master of his people, but as
his Christian Majesty would concert the sharing of
those provinces with his brother of England the
naval power and trade of Great Britain would receive
an incredible augmentation by the destruction of a
state that was her only competitor by sea, and in
commerce and riches promoted thereby. For that
not only their shipping and seamen, together with
their chief seaports and best provinces all entire,
would be his Majesty's, but also that all the most
wealthy and substantial merchants, and industrious
and ingenious tradesmen and artificers, even of the
provinces and parts that should fall to the share of
the most Christian king, would in all appearance
transplant themselves either into England or Ireland,
as lying more convenient for trade than their own
country, or at least into those parts of the Netherlands which should be reduced under the power of
the king of Great Britain; to whose domination as
approaching nearest the sweetness and freedom of
that they now were under they would certainly more




           <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>

willingly submit their persons and fortunes than to
that of the more absolute one of the French monarch,
against which they had entertained a thousand prejudices. In fine she most earnestly and affectionately
besought him to take these matters into his most
serious consideration and to return a speedy and if it
might in any ways be a favourable answer, that she
might have the happiness to return back the messenger of good news and such news as might prove
a foundation of a lasting felicity to both the illustrious families from which both his Majesty and
herself were descended.  The king after a little
silence told her by way of reply to the things she had
represented to him, that it was impossible for him to
doubt the ardency and reality of the affection of a
sister so amiable, and who Had always expressed so
much tenderness for his interest, that he as little
questioned but that she had penetrated as far into
the interiors of his brother of France as it was possible anyone could into the heart of a king; and
therefore upon her representation of him chiefly
which he assured her would induce him to give more
credit to the favourable conjectures he had made of
his temper during the little time he had the honour
to converse with him whilst in exile, and to the
general character he had, since his personal administration of public affairs, obtained in the world, being
a prince of great honour and generosity; and thereupon passing by some former unhandsome and
unkind treatments in his court, as pure effects and
and influences of the over-ruling ascendant of the



<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>

  then regnant Mazarin and not of the prince's own
  inclination, he should put much confidence in the
  sincerity of the most Christian king, and accordingly
  desired her to return his said Majesty his royal and
  most hearty thanks for these obliging expressions of
  amity and affection he had signified to him by her,
  and to assure him in his name he should ever have
  his friendship in high esteem, and would go as great
  lengths as in prudence and interest he could to serve
  him and to comply with his desires. But that the
  matters proposed being of the highest consequence,
  he must beg his excuse if he required more time to
  give him a positive and satisfactory answer thereto
  than the short space limited for her stay in England
  would permit; however, that he would with all convenient expedition give him a better account. In
  the meanwhile he should request his most Christian
  brother by her to do him the justice to believe he
  was as sincerely affectioned to his person as he
could be to his, and should ever persist to be, as far
as a king of England could, his constant and obsequious friend. The like answer, as far as it was
agreeable to his circumstances, was returned by the
duke. After which the princess renewing the charge
in the business of religion, the king freely told her
that as to that point, though he had entertained
very kind and favourable thoughts of the Roman
religion and its professors, for several reasons instanced, and did believe that if it were re-established
in his dominions the monarchy would be safer and
easier than it could be under the present state of



        <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

Protestancy, yet he was not so fully satisfied of it as
to make it his own religion, and that on the other
side he foresaw such insurmountable difficulties in
attempting such a re-establishment that he did not
think any policy, no, nor the whole power of France,
could he command it all entire, without any diversion
from other interested neighbours (too extraordinary
a juncture to be probably expected), could be able
to carry him well through them. To which the princess, who saw well enough, as well by his looks and
actions as by his expressions, that she had made
more sensible impressions on his spirits than he was
willing to acknowledge, thinking she had done
enough for her part and sufficiently broke the ice for
those that should be designed to push the point further at more leisure, modestly replied that since that
was his Majesty's sense in which he was fixed she
would waive all farther importunities on that subject
and leave it wholly depending between himself and
God, whom she would continually pray to inspire his
Majesty with light enough to know and courage
enough to embrace the truth in his appointed time.
But, however, she should be glad to know his Majesty's sentiments as to the design against Holland,
adding that she was confident he could not but think
it was at least for his interest, and feasible too. Yes,
madam, answered the king, I am convinced that, if
crowned with success, it would be enough for the
interests of this monarchy and of my subjects too;
but yet as practicable as it seemeth to you, it is likewise not without its difficulties, and those very great






<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>

ones too, for the ill-success of my last war with that
nation, the dissatisfaction of my people thereupon,
the triple league in which I am lately engaged with
Holland, the inclination my subjects have for the
Dutch, as being a Protestant nation, and the implacable aversion they have to the French, and their
jealousies of their power and of their religion, are
mighty obstacles in the way; however, if my brother
of France can propose me any practicable expedients
to remove them, which I make no doubt, I will, as I
have said, do what I can to comply with him in that
enterprise, and so the princess declaring herself well
satisfied with what had been said on the subject of
her errand, they passed from the businesses of State

</p><p>  Concerning Monsieur Le Tellier's sentiments in
regard to the management of the affairs of England
to the advantage of the French, among other expedients he proposed the sending over some choice
female as might be capable to charm a prince whose
heart was so susceptible of an amorous flame as that
of the king of England. In conformity to which
project they made choice of the opportunity of the
princess's going over to effect it, and therefore she
upon her arrival presented our king, her brother,
with her woman, known then by the name of Madame
Carwell, but much better since by the title of Duchess
of Portsmouth.</p>

</p><p>  I. It has been agreed, ordered, and concluded
that there shall henceforth be for ever a good, secure,
and firm peace, true brotherhood, confederation,
alliance, and interchange of offices between the said
sovereign king of Great Britain, his heirs and successors, on the one part, and the said sovereign and
most Christian king on the other, &amp;c.
</p><p>  II. The sovereign king of Great Britain being
convinced of the truth of the Catholic religion, and
resolved to make confession of it and to reconcile
himself with the Roman Church as soon as the affairs
of his kingdom permit him, &amp;c.
</p><p>  III. It has been agreed between the most Christian
king and his Majesty of Great Britain that the said
most Christian king shall never break the peace which
has been made with Spain, nor contravene in any
point that which he has promised in the treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle.

new titles or rights to the kingdom of Spain fall to
the lot of his most Christian Majesty the said king
of Great Britain shall assist his most Christian Majesty with all his forces both by sea and land in order
to facilitate the acquisition of the said rights, &amp;c.

and the other many more subjects than they have
need of to justify to the world the resolution which
they have taken to mortify the pride of the united
provinces of the Low Countries . . . it is agreed,
ordered, and concluded that their Majesties shall
declare and make war conjointly with all their forces
both by land and sea upon the said States General
of the United Provinces, &amp;c.

good an issue as the said sovereign kings hope for
the justice of the common cause, it has also been

Britain only binding himself to send and maintain
under the commandership of his most Christian
Majesty six thousand foot soldiers, &amp;c.

Majesty pledges himself to pay every year to the said
king as long as the war shall last in manner aforesaid
the sum of three millions of French livres, of which
the first payment to be made three months before
the declaration of war shall be of seven hundred and
fifty thousand French livres, the second of like sum

months after the declaration of war aforesaid: and in

</p><p>  The ministers of this Court are not only the
most inquisitive persons in the world into the
affairs of other Courts, but even into the persons who
manage them; whose natures, dispositions, religion,
natural and acquired abilities, as well as respective
infirmities, they endeavour to sift out to the quick
that so they may use them or shun them as they find
occasion: and for this reason it is that they make
some remarks upon them in their minutes, as well as
upon the affairs transacted by them. And therefore
since the five persons who made up the Cabal in
England   . . . . , and who your lordship may
remember were the dukes of Buckingham and Lauderdale, the earls of Shaftesbury and Arlington, and
the Lord Treasurer Clifford, were very distinguishable
for the stations they filled the offices they held and
the parts each of them acted in the government; I
find this character given of them: for the duke of
Buckingham, as he was the king's favourite, so he
really deserved to be so, as being very capable to be
a minister of state if his application to business had
been answerable to his talents; if his mind, which
was furnished with excellent endowments, had not
been distracted by libertinism, which was in him
to an extreme degree; and by a love to his pleasures,





<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>



which made one of those persons in the world that
was fittest for great and solid things vain and frivolous. Of the duke of Lauderdale there is little or
nothing said but that he is a great and quaint politician, and no question but he has merited that
character at their hand. Of my lord Clifford they
are as profuse in their praises, as I doubt they have
been too of their money; saying he was a person who
wanted nothing but a theatre where virtue and reason
had been much more in use than it was in his country in the age wherein he lived, for to be superior
to and overtop the rest. My lord of Arlington they
make to be a person of meaner capacity, and a more
limited genius than any of the five, but say his experiences supply the defect, and have acquired him
especially a very great knowledge of foreign affairs.
Last of all, they bring in Anthony Ashley-Cooper,
the renowned earl of Shaftesbury; of whom they say
he was by far the fittest person of any of them to
manage a great enterprise, and so was as the soul to
all the rest, being endued with a vast capacity, clear
judgment, bold nature, and subtle wit, equally firm
and constant in all he undertook; a constant friend
but an implacable enemy; with many other expressions, such as his not being terrified either with the
greatness or the multitude of crimes he judges
necessary for his own preservation, or the destruction
of others much to his lordship's dishonour, which is
a clear argument he was not for their interest, and
for which he is much beholden to them.

</p><p>  The Parliament of these days had, from the beginning, which was soon after the Restoration, been
perfectly well inclined to the king: they had given
him a very great revenue upon tonnage and poundage,
and also began excise upon several sorts of liquors,
hearth-money, not to mention temporary taxes, the
whole amounting to above three times more than had
been enjoyed by any king of England before. The





<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>


country groaned under this pressure, and began to
be dissatisfied; which having an influence on some
gentlemen of both houses, gave birth to two parties,
the one for the country, the other for the Court. The
former pretended in an impartial manner to espouse
the cause of the people in their liberties and properties, and whatever is dear to Englishmen; to assert
the religion and government by law established; the
latter pretended to the same, but thought the king
was to have a competent income and be invested with
a due power for the exercise of his regal office, without having two great a dependence on the people, a
cause which had been of such pernicious effects to
his royal father.  Hence it was that gentlemen
bestirred themselves more than usual to be elected
into a seat in Parliament; so that great was the competition amongst the candidates, and at great expenses
they were, even from one or two hundred, to two
thousand pounds.  But the concerns of the public
were not what alone actuated all men ; some wanted
to be in the House to be screened from their debts,
the Parliament having sat a long while; and some
had obtained great emoluments from the Court to
stand up for that interest.

<p>  Lauderdale  ..        was taken prisoner after
the fight at Worcester, and from that time kept
prisoner in Windsor Castle, from whence he was set
free upon the king's restoration; but became so poor
that it is said he could not meet the king for want of
money to pay for a pair of boots. . .  .  In the
late wars between the king and Parliament, he, with
sir John Cheesley were ordered commissioners by
the Kirk Faction to the Parliament in England for
propagating the Presbyterian government; but this
being most detestable at court, Lauderdale, to raise
himself, set himself with all his skill to oppose it;
and by it at first got to be made principal secretary of
state of Scotland, and as renegadoes from Christianity
become the greatest persecutors of Christians, so was
Lauderdale of the Kirk and Presbyterian government.
However, Lauderdale seemed zealous for calling a
Parliament in Scotland, and demolishing the forts
that bridled the Scots, which Monk opposed.
hereby Lauderdale became popular in Scotland, so
that all applications to the king from thence were by
Lauderdale.
</p>




<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>


<p>   In this state it was not easily determined who
should be commissioner in Scotland, in case a Parliament should be called; for affairs were not yet
ripe to make a Popish one, nor would the court trust
a Presbyterian one; and Lauderdale would not forsake his place at court, where he governed all, but
continue it, that all the motions in Parliament might
receive their life from him, At last it was agreed
that Middleton (who first served the Kirk against the
king, Charles I, and after changing sides, made some
bustle in Scotland after the king left it) should be
created an earl, and made a commissioner, and a
Parliament should be called in Scotland.
</p><p>  The nobility and gentry of Scotland clearly saw
there was no other way to redeem Scotland from
being a conquered nation, and a province to England,
but by an entire submission to the king. Lauderdale
knew this as well as they, and therefore resolved to
make them pay dear for their deliverance; and now
you shall see the nobility and gentry, which with the
Kirk united against Charles I., divide under his son,
and sacrifice the Kirk, and all their discipline, to
make an atonement for themselves. The first act
which was shewed herein was upon this occasion.
</p><p>  The fiery zeal of the Kirkmen burnt up all rules
of prudence, or the consideration of the present
state of Scotland, so that even in this state, crowns
and sceptres must submit to the Kirk; and that the
king might know his duty, a company of them met
together, and drew up a supplication (as they said),
but in nature a remonstrance to the king, setting forth




<pb id="p.113" n="113"/>



the calamities they groaned under in the time of the
usurpers, by their impious encroachments upon the
kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the liberties thereof,
which of themselves they were not able to suppress
and overcome, and the danger of the popish and
prelatical party, now beginning again to lift up their
head, and press him to mind his oaths and covenant
with God, &amp;c.
</p><p>  The committee of estates well knowing how ungrateful this would be to the king, upon the 23rd of
August, <date value="1660">1660</date>, sent a party and apprehended these
men, whereof one Mr. James Guthrie was the chief
(of whom you'll hear more hereafter), and committed
them prisoners to Edinburgh Castle, and from thence
Guthrie was sent prisoner to Dundee for treasonable
and seditious reflecting on his Majesty, and on the
Government of England, and the constitution of the
committee of State, and tending to raise new tumults,
and kindling a new civil war among his Majesty's
good subjects.
</p><p>  This was the first spark, which soon burnt into
such a flame as totally consumed the whole Kirk
party in Scotland and left them in a much worse
plight than before, when they suffered under the
usurpation (as they called it) of the English.
</p><p>  For during the late usurpation, the Kirk enjoyed a
liberty of conscience; but it's the nature of some
men, that unless they may persecute other men, to
exclaim they are persecuted themselves, and therefore
(since they were not able to do it themselves) they
minded the king of his covenant with God, to extirpate






<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>


heresy, schism, and profaneness, and to remove
the stumbling which the king had given them, in
admitting prelacy, ceremonies and service book in
the king's chapel, and places of his dominions. But
these men were mistaken in their measures, for after
the king was expelled from Scotland, by Cromwell,
he little (I may say never) observed the directory of
worship, confession of faith, and catechisms in his
family, according to the national and solemn league
and covenant, as he repeated in his coronation oath
[at Scone], and less the establishing the Presbyterian
government in England and Ireland, and least of all
in Scotland.
</p><p>  For one of the first acts of the first session was an
anniversary thanksgiving, to be observed upon every
29th May, with this pro&#x00EB;m:
</p><p>  "The states of Parliament of the kingdom  of
Scotland, taking into their consideration the sad
condition, slavery and bondage, this ancient kingdom has groaned under these twenty-three years"
(the time when the troubles arose in king Charles
the First's reign) "in which under very specious
pretences of reformation a public rebellion has been,
by the treachery of some, and mispersuasion of others,
violently carried on against sacred authority, to the
ruin and destruction, as far as was possible, of religion,
the king's Majesty and his royal government and
laws, liberties and property of the people, and all the
public and private interests of the kingdom, so that
religion itself hath been prostituted for the warrant
of all these treasonable invasions made upon the


<pb id="p.115" n="115"/>



royal authority, and disloyal limitations upon the
allegiance of the subjects. Therefore upon the 29th
of May be set apart for a Holy Day, &amp;c." Yet
so soon after the king's restoration, he wrote to the
presbytery of Edinburgh, promising to countenance
the church as by law established; but Lauderdale
knew his mind better.
</p><p>  Here it's observable that in <date value="1635">1635</date>, when the Kirk
were so zealous, with lifted up hands in the presence
of the eternal God, to swear to establish their national
covenant, there was not one of the nobility (but the
Popish) except the marquis of Hamilton and the earl
of Traquair, but joined with the Kirk, expressly
against the king's command : Traquair the Kirk
party proceeding against as an incendiary ; and
after, Hamilton secretly joined with the Covenanters,
for which king Charles I. made him prisoner in Pendennis Castle; from whence he was discharged when
Fairfax had it surrendered : and not one of the
nobility (except Argyll and Cassilis) but declare this,
and all the Kirk proceedings since, treasonable
rebellion against the laws, liberties and property of
the people, and prostitution of religion; and this
declaration was celebrated with a double sacrifice,
the marquis of Argyll being executed as a traitor for
holding correspondence with Cromwell; and his
head set where Montrose's stood on the Monday
before: and Mr. Guthrie on the Saturday after, for
refusing to own the jurisdiction of the judges in
ecclesiastical affairs; and his head set upon one of
the posts of Edinburgh. This was a sad presage to






<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>



the Kirk of what followed  . . . The next Act
(I cannot say Parliamentary, for it was purely arbitrary)
</p><p>    . . was the total rooting out of the Presbyterian
government in Scotland  . . . upon this occasion
</p><p>...    . Mr. James Sharp, Mr. Hamilton, Mr.
Fairwell, Mr. Loghton (but whether sent for by the
king or sent by the Kirk party I do not find) came in
<date value="1661">1661</date>, to London, and were ordained deacons and
presbyters, and after, consecrated bishops, by the
bishop of Winchester and two other bishops. The
acceptance of such a renunciation of their Presbyterian ordination; nay, it was a declaration of the
invalidity of their former ordination, and thereupon,
the king on the sixth of September, <date value="1661">1661</date>, issued out
a proclamation declaring his royal pleasure to be for
the restoring the government of the Church in Scotland to be by archbishops and bishops, as it was
exercised in the year <date value="1637">1637</date>; and that he had nominated and presented archbishops and bishops to
their several bishoprics, and to have the same authority they had in the reign of his grandfather .
</p><p>        In obedience to this proclamation the Privy
Council, the ninth of January following, did discharge
all ecclesiastical meetings in synods, presbyteries,
and sessions until they be authorised by the archbishops and bishops upon their entry unto the
government of their respective sees, which was to be
done speedily.
</p><p>  Though this proclamation and intimation of the
Privy Council had prevented the Parliament, yet to
make sure work of both the Parliament, in their




  <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>

second sessions, redintegrated the bishops to the
exercise of their episcopal functions and to all their
privileges, dignities, jurisdictions, and possessions,
due and formerly belonging thereunto.
</p><p>  And another act did ordain all ministers to repair
unto their diocesan assembly and concur in all acts
of church discipline, and as they should be required
by the archbishops or bishops of the diocese under
pain of being suspended from their office and benefice till the next diocesan meeting, for their first
fault; and if they amended not, to be deprived and
the church to be declared vacant. . . Though the
high commission which Laud so zealously endeavoured to erect in Scotland was put down by Act of
Parliament <date value="1661">1661</date>, in England, yet the king by the
inherent right of his crown, and by virtue of his
prerogative royal and supreme authority in causes
ecclesiastic, erected one in Scotland: the commissioners were partly ecclesiastics and partly laymen,
who (or five of them, whereof one to be a bishop)
had more arbitrary power given them over the clergy
than was practised in England, under Laud, and
more than Laud could have expected, for an high
commission for Scotland, in the king's father's reign.
</p><p>  Thus you see the Kirk which would be a distinct
table and independent upon the crown of Scotland
are by the prerogative of it committed to the arbitrary
mercy of the prelates, whom for above four-and-
twenty years they had been railing against and by
many oaths sware to extirpate.
</p><p>             For the year after, viz. <date value="1663">1663</date> . .





<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>







the king granted a toleration and indulgence to
dissenters from the Church. Thinking men thought
this strange, that the king should the year before
pass the Act of Uniformity, as the best means to
secure the Church against Popery and fanaticism,
and thus grant a toleration. It could not be in
favour of them termed fanatics, who kept him from
his crown ; and that year Venner with his party would
have expelled him again; and this year swarms of
pamphlets were spread abroad, to defame his person
and Government, for printing some of which, Twyne,
the printer, was hanged.
</p><p>  Thinking men considered, too, the time when this
indulgence was granted; for as the king in the sale
of Dunkirk chose to do it in the interval of the sitting
of Parliament, so he did grant this indulgence
. . . in November, when the Parliament was
prorogued to February.
</p><p>  But though the Parliament would take no notice
of the sale of Dunkirk, they did of this; and therefore the Commons, upon their meeting, entered into
a serious debate about it, and made an address to
the king, humbly requesting how it would reflect
upon the wisdom of Parliament to have such an
alteration made so soon, and that for aught they
could foresee would end in Popery; and sure the
Commons were true prophets herein.  However,
whether the fearing the continuance of the indulgence might retard the Commons in giving him
money, or that the time was not yet ripe enough to
insist upon it at present, he recalled his declaration,





<pb id="p.119" n="119"/>



so that though the king did establish an High Commission in Scotland by his prerogative inherent in
his crown, yet this indulgence had not the like effect
in England.
</p><p>  This indulgence may seem more strange where the
Irish this very year were contriving a massacre of the
Protestants, and holding intelligence with the French
king, which you may read at large in Plunket's trial,
and this proved by Popish witnesses. I do not find
the Irish had any countenance herein by the king,
nor do I believe the French king acquainted his
brother of England with it; yet the insincerity of the
king's intentions of any benefit the Protestant dissenters should have by this indulgence will appear
when the Parliament, seeing the danger which the
prosecution of Protestant dissenters might bring
upon the nation, had prepared bills for the ease of
Protestant dissenters that the king would not pass
them.

<p>      Burnet: History of his own Time, <date value="1724">1724</date>, vol. 1, p. 196
</p><p>  <date value="1663">1663</date>.-The Church party was alarmed at all this,
and though they were unwilling to suspect the king
or the duke, yet the management for Popery was so
visible that in the next session of Parliament the
king's declaration was severely arraigned and the
authors of it were plainly enough pointed at. This
was done chiefly by the lord Clarendon's friends.
And at this the earl of Bristol was highly displeased,





<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>


and resolved to take all possible methods to ruin the
earl of Clarendon. He had a great skill in astrology,
and had possessed the king with a high opinion of
it; and told the duke of Buckingham, as he said to
the earl of Rochester, Wilmot, from whom I had it,
that he was confident that he would lay that before
the king, which would totally alienate him both from
his brother and from the lord Clarendon: for he
could demonstrate by the principles of that art that
he was to fall by his brother's means, if not by his
hand; and he was sure this would work on the king.
It would so, said the duke of Buckingham, but in
another way than he expected, for it would make the
king so afraid of offending him that he would do
anything rather than provoke him. Yet the lord
Bristol would lay this before the king. And the duke
of Buckingham believed that it had the effect ever
after that he had apprehended: for though the king
never loved nor esteemed the duke, yet he seemed to
stand in some sort of awe of him.
</p><p>   But this was not all: the lord Bristol resolved to
offer articles of impeachment against the earl of
Clarendon to the House of Lords. . . So the lord
Bristol drew his impeachment and carried it to the
king, who took much pains . . . to dissuade him
from it. But he would not be wrought on.
The next day he carried the charge to the House of
Lords. It was of a very mixed nature: in one part
he charged Clarendon with raising jealousies and
spreading reports of the king's being a papist; and
yet in the other articles he charged him with correspondence


<pb id="p.121" n="121"/>



with the Court of Rome, in order to the
making the lord Aubigny a cardinal, and several
other things of a very strange nature. As soon as he
put it in he it seems either repented of it or at least
was prevailed with to abscond. . . Proclamations
went out for discovering him. But he kept out of
the way till the storm was over.

</p><p>  The earl of Lauderdale at his first coming to the
king stuck firm for Presbytery. He told me the king
spoke to him to let that go, for it was not a religion
for gentlemen. He being really a Presbyterian, but
at the same time resolving to get into the king's
confidence, studied to convince the king. ... to
keep up Presbytery still in Scotland.
</p><p>  In the end of the year (<date value="1660">1660</date>) the earl of Middleton
came down [to Scotland] in great magnificence; his
way of living was the most splendid the nation had
ever seen, but it was likewise the most scandalous,
for vices of all sorts were the open practices of those
about him.

</p><p>  The earl of Middleton . . came up to London,
and was very coldly received by the king. The earl
of Lauderdale moved that a Scottish council might
be called. . . When it met the lord Lauderdale




<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>


accused the earl of Middleton of many malversations
in the great trust he had been in. . . Towards
the end of May the king called many of the English
counsellors together . . . the king said his errors
were so great and so many that the credit of his
affairs must suffer if he continued them any longer
in such hands. Yet he promised . . . he would
still be kind to him, for he looked on him as a very
honest man. Few days after that secretary Morris
was sent to him, with a warrant under the king's
hand, requiring him to deliver up his commission,
which he did. . . . The earl of Rothes was declared the king's commissioner. But the earl of
Lauderdale would not trust him. So he went down
with him, and kept him too visibly in a dependence
on him, for all his high character.

</p><p>  While they [Lauderdale and Rothes] were going
on with their affairs they understood that an Act had
passed in the Parliament of England against all conventicles, empowering justices of peace to convict
offenders without juries. . . Any meeting for religious worship at which five were present more than
the family was declared a conventicle. And every
person above sixteen that was present at it was to lie
three months in prison, or pay &#x00A3;5 for the first
offence; six months for the second offence, or to pay
&#x00A3;20 fine; and for the third offence, being convict by
a jury, was to be banished to any plantation except




<pb id="p.123" n="123"/>



New England or Virginia, or to pay &#x00A3;100. All
people were amazed at this severity. But the bishops
in Scotland took heart upon it, and resolved to copy
from it. So an Act was passed almost in the same
terms. And at the passing it lord Lauderdale in a
long speech expressed great zeal for the Church.

purely to serve their interest and designs, but they
must put him upon another piece of state-drudgery
which at the same time I am well satisfied he was
not of himself much averse to, and that was the
declaration of indulgence to tender consciences, as
they were pleased to cant nickname] it. They
knew well enough what severe laws were in force
against all those that dissented from the public
church, and some of them fresh enough in memory
not to be soon forgotten; and they knew full as well,
that with the Popish and Presbyterianly affected persons, as well as the prerogative and republican party

the great dangers and mischiefs that may arise within
this your Majesty's realm by the increase of Popish

born subjects to your Majesty, are obliged to attend
upon your royal consort the queen) to depart within
30 days out of this your Majesty's kingdom; and that
if any priest or Jesuit shall happen to be taken in

that the lord chancellor of England shall, on or
before the 25th of March next, issue out commissions
of Dedimus potestatem to the judge advocate and
commissaries of the musters, and such other persons
as he shall think fit (not being officers commanding
soldiers) to tender the oath of allegiance and supremacy to all officers and soldiers now in your Majesty's
service and pay, and that such as refuse the said
oaths may be immediately disbanded, and not allowed
or continued to any pay or pension; and that the
chancellor shall require due returns to be made
thereof within some convenient time after the issuing
out of the said commissions.

commanded and enjoined by your Majesty's warrant,
upon penalty of losing their places, not to permit
any officer to be mustered in the service and pay of
your Majesty till he shall have taken the oaths of
allegiance and supremacy, and received the sacrament
of the Lord's Supper according to the laws and
usage of the Church of England; and that every
soldier serving at land shall take the said oaths
before his first muster and receive the sacrament in
such manner before his second muster.-And this we

The head of all the factious clan,
By whom our feuds were first began;
The city's god, the rabble's leader,
A lord, a rebel, and a trader
Who keeps his changes and cabals,
At public halls and festivals;
An old rebellious canting wizard,
Who loves the rump with all his gizzard;
Hell's journeyman, our plot projector,
The rebel's patriot and protector,
So loose no royal smiles can win him,
So base the very devil 's in him;
The sower of seditious seeds,
The planter of rebellious weeds,
The quintessence of all that's naught,
And yet too cunning to be caught;
The subtle baffler of the laws,
The bulwark of the good old cause,
The fatal firebrand of the nation,
The spring of all abomination,
The Cacafugo of the age,
The Samford of the public stage,
The broacher of destructive schism,
The very tap of devilism,
Through which all sorts of treasons flow,
That with his dropsic humours grow,
Yet once was great in the esteem
Of him that wears the diadem;
But still when high in power and place,
The statesman did the judge disgrace,
And show his nature to be base:

of this same treaty than what has come within my
cognisance; but so much as has .... I as
freely communicate.               The duke was
engaged to stick close to his alliance with France,
declining all treaties with those of the House of
Austria . . . . to oppose to the utmost of his
power the king, his brother, from engaging in any
war for the confederates  .... doing his
utmost for the propagation of the Catholic religion,
pursuing measures for dividing of Protestants ....
and particularly to raise arms in Scotland and Ireland,

received in hand three hundred thousand crowns
</p><p>             he was to have a considerable annuity
of six hundred thousand crowns  .... and
six hundred thousand crowns extraordinary; and
Jewish bankers were accordingly employed to
transmit the money to him from time to time:
besides all which the king's confessor promised
him a private contribution from the clergy, and
others under his influence, of six hundred thousand
crowns more.

money for the king's present occasion; the county

enacted for the better security of the Protestant
religion, and the grand point of property. But the
two were so equal that nothing but mere words
passed between them; mere words without any effect,

us, that he was four millions in debt, exclusive of

many families. It being put the vote whether money
should be given or not, it was carried in the negative
by four voices, and that when near four hundred
members were in the house. But it appearing, that
both the Dutch and French exceeded us, in the
proportion and number of their shipping, a sum of
three hundred thousand pounds was voted to the
king for the building of twenty ships, namely, one of
the first rate, five of the second and fourteen of the
third.                 The state of the fleet was
now given in, by which it appeared that we had no
more than eight first rates, nine second rates, and
forty-three third rates; while the French exceeded
us in the number of these rates by six and twenty
and the Dutch by fourteen.

</p><p>  The business of Luzance took up some time in
the House. This Luzance was a French Jesuit, but
becoming a convert to the Church of England,
inveighed against the fallacies of the Church of
Rome in a sermon he preached in the French
Church in the Savoy. This alarmed the Papists,
and particularly one Burnet a Jesuit, and confessor
to the duchess of York, who finding him alone in his



<pb id="p.137" n="137"/>



chamber, and posting three men at the door threatened to murder him if he did not make satisfaction
for the injury, eat his words, and speedily return to
France. The man in this desperate dilemma promised
faithfully whatever was required of him, till he got
his liberty, when presently going to Doctor Breval,
a converted Jesuit as well as himself, he told him the
whole story; Breval the next day acquainted me
with it, and I communicated it to the House. The
Commons took fire at this and straight appointed a
Committee to examine into the matter and ordered
me to produce Luzance the next day. He appeared
accordingly and averred the thing for a truth.....
Upon the report made from the committee to the
House, my lord Cavendish called me up to give an
account of some other things I had had from
Luzance.  One was that two French Protestants
being merchants of great substance and credit had
been threatened by certain Papists, that if they were
not less severe upon the Romanists they should ere
long see the Protestant blood flow in London streets.
A committee was appointed to enquire into the truth
of this matter; and Luzance being summoned, gave
evidence to the very same effect, and gave it under
his own hand. The parties he had his information
from being sent for, appeared also, and declared such
threats to have been used towards them by some
French Papists; but to what cause it was owing is
uncertain; they gave in only such names as were of
persons either absent or of no estimation; so that
little came of this business. But these and other




<pb id="p.138" n="138"/>
informations, concerning the height and insolence of
the Papists, did so exasperate the House that many
motions were made to humble them. Some were for
a speedy confinement of them to the country, others
for banishment, and some again for disarming them,
and the like.

has got what she deserved. She wished to be the
king's mistress, and she is so; he is always with her
in the face of all the court; she has had a son who
has been acknowledged, and presented with two
duchies.  She amasses treasure, and is feared and
respected as much as possible; but she did not
foresee that a young actress that the king doats
upon would stand in her way; she has not the power
to keep him away from her, and he divides his care,
his time, and his health between the two. The
actress is as proud as the duchess; she mocks her,
pulls faces at her, attacks her, and stealing the king
from her, boasts whenever he gives her the preference.
She is young, indiscreet, bold, free and lively; she
sings, she dances, and takes her position as she finds
it. She, too, has a son, and hopes to have him
acknowledged  in this she reasons thus :-" This
duchess says she plays the person of quality ; she
claims all the great people in France as her relations,
and goes into mourning when anyone dies. If she



<pb id="p.139" n="139"/>



be a lady, why is she a courtesan ?  She should die
of shame ! As for me it is my profession, I don't
pretend to anything better. The king keeps me, for
the moment I am constant. He has a son by me,
I claim that he ought to recognise him, and I expect
he will, for he loves me as well as mademoiselle."
This girl gets the upper hand, and puts the duchess
greatly out of countenance.

</p><p>  My Lord, - I have already upon two several
occasions observed to your lordship, how the duke
and duchess [of York] were drawn into private correspondence with the French court, which when they
had once happily effected, and by them and some
others, already in their interests  . . . drawn in
manymore both courtiers and others; they proceeded
being thus so considerably reinforced to hedge in
the king himself. And it was high time, for they
had now a greater jealousy than ever of the match
with the prince of Orange [i.e., the princess Mary,


<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>

afterwards Queen, to William of Orange]. . . But
in that the king told them there might be difficulties
innumerable and so could promise them nothing but
his endeavours . . . by reason the Parliament and
people were much out of humour . . . because
now for him to go about to cross them afresh in
obstructing or so much as delaying such a match
[with a Protestant prince] the proposal whereof was
already so much known to his people, and found to
be so much desired by them . . . would hinder
them perhaps from granting such supplies as he
might otherwise expect from them; unless his most
Christian Majesty obliged himself to supply him with
money enough to heed them not, or at least to buy
votes, and to stop clamorous mouths. But as for that
motion of theirs, about committing the children [of
the duke of York, who were the heirs apparent] to the
Duke's care and tutorage . . he absolutely denied
them, saying they were his children or rather the
nation's, and not the duke's, especially now he had
marched so much against the nation's liking; and
that could he have believed the people of England
would have taken so much alarm at that marriage [of
the duke of York with Mary of Modena] he should
have taken care to have stopped it in time ; but that
having let one fault pass, to admit another much
worse, was a thing he doubted not but would cause
such earthquakes, as he was resolved not to run the
risk of therefore should not do it. So that article
was wholly laid aside and the treaty concluded without it; by which the French king was to pay ours an

 <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>


annuity of twelve hundred thousand crowns, whereof
six hundred thousand in hand, besides a donative of
like sum for extraordinaries: and if any occasion
should happen by crossness of parliaments, rebellion
or otherwise, that should reasonably require so much,
then he was promised to have it augmented to twelve
millions of livres,<note place="foot" n="1"> It should be recollected here and elsewhere that the French
livre is thefranc, not the English pound sterling.</note> whilst such troubles should last;
though this latter part they never intended, but gave
orders he should be treated only with a bit now and
then  .... only if a civil war should happen,
they were to feed it on both sides, till it were fit to
pour French forces among them, &amp;c.
In this treaty, which was concluded by a private
agent, as were the others, there was a clause inserted
which gave the king leave, if too much pressed upon,
to pretend as if he would side with the confederates
against France, and to get money of them, as also of
his parliament on that account; yet he was by no
means to declare, but to get an army and revenue
settled for some time, such as was supposed to be
the duration of the war, and then to use both the one
and the other to settle his prerogative royal and to
make himself absolute.

</p><p>  The parliament met according to their late adjournment from April 16th to the 21st May, <date value="1677">1677</date>. There
was no speech to the parliament, but in the House
of Commons.
</p><p>  This meeting was opened with a verbal message,
delivered by Mr. Secretary Coventry; wherein his
Majesty acquainted the House that having according
to their desire in their answer to his last message,
April the 16th, directed their adjournment to this
time because they did acknowledge it as unparliamentary to grant supplies when the House was so
thin, in expectation of a speedy adjournment. And
having so issued out his proclamation of summons,
to the end that there might be a full House, he did
now expect they would forthwith enter upon the
consideration of his last message. And because he





<pb id="p.143" n="143"/>

did intend there should be a great recess very quickly.
</p><p>  Upon this it was moved, That the king's last messsage of the 16th of April, and the answer thereunto,
should be read; and they were read accordingly.
</p><p>  Thereupon, after a long silence, a discourse began
about their expectation and the necessity of alliances;
and particularly it was intimated that an alliance with
Holland was most expedient. For that we should
deceive ourselves if we thought we could be otherwise
defended. For we alone could not withstand the
French, his purse and power is too great; nor could
the Dutch withstand him alone, but both together
might.
</p><p>  The general discourse was, That they came with
an expectation to have alliances declared; and if
they were not made so as to be imparted, they were
not called or come to that purpose they were desired
and hoped to meet; and if few days might ripen
them, they would be content to adjourn for that mean
time.
</p><p>  The secretary et al. said, These alliances were of
great weight and difficulty, and the time had been
short.  But if they were finished, yet it was not
convenient to publish them till the king was in a
readiness and posture to prosecute and maintain
them; till then, his Majesty could not so much as
speak out or insist upon his words. That without
&#x00A3;600,000 it would not be possible for him to speak
or act those things which should answer the ends of
the several addresses without exposing the kingdom
to a much greater danger.
</p>



<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>
<p>  By others it was observed and said, that they met
now upon a public notice by proclamation, which
proclamation was in pursuance of their last address,
in which they desired the king they might adjourn
to such a time, as within which (they hoped) the
alliances might be fixed, so as to be imparted. They
mentioned not any particular day. If his Majesty
had not thought this time long enough for that
purpose he might have appointed the adjournment
for a longer time. Or he might have given notice
by proclamation, that upon this Act they should
rejourn to a yet longer time.
</p><p>  But truly the time hath been sufficient, especially
considering the readiness of the parties to be allied
with; it is five weeks since our recess. He that was
a minister chiefly employed concerning the Triple
League, has published in print that the League was
made in five days. And yet this might well be
thought a matter more tedious and longer than this.
For when a people are in profound peace (as the
Dutch then were) it is not easy to embrace them
presently into leagues. They have time, and may
take time for great deliberation. But here the people
are in desire of war and need our alliance: and
therefore it might be contracted with ease and expedition, were we as forward as they.
</p><p>  Neither is five weeks the limit of time that hath
been for this purpose. For it is above ten weeks
since we first addressed for these alliances.
</p><p>  And as to the objection, that it was not fit to make
them known before preparations were made; it was



<pb id="p.145" n="145"/>



said that the force of that lay in this: that the French
would be alarmed. To which it was answered that
the asking and giving money for this purpose would
be no less an alarm. For the French could not be
ignorant of what addresses and answers have passed.
And if money be granted to make warlike preparations
for the ends therein specified, it is rather a greater
discovery and denouncing of what we intend against
the French.
</p>
<p>
Grotius (de jure belli et pacis). <note place="foot" n="1">Lib. 2, Cap. 2 Sect. 39, et alib.Lord Bacon's Essay of Empry.</note>If a prince makes extraordinary preparations (a neighbour prince being
affected by them) may expostulate
and demand an account of the purpose for which
they are intended, and if he receive not satisfaction
that they are not to be used against him, it is a
cause of war on his part, so as the neighbour may
begin (if he think fit) and is not bound to stay till
they first prepare and begin actual hostility, and
this is agreeable to reason and the nature of governments.
</p><p>  Now the French king is a vigilant prince and has
wise ministers about him, upon which general
account though we had not (as we have seen) an
extraordinary embassy here, during our recess, we
should suppose that the French king has demanded
an account of our king's purpose whether the extraordinary preparations (that are begun to be made)
are designed against him or not. In which case his
Majesty could give one of these three reasons.
</p>




<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>
<p>  I. To say, they are not designed against him, and
then his Majesty may acquaint us with the same, and
then there is no reason of giving money.
</p><p>  II. To say, they are designed against him. In
which case, his Majesty may very well impart the
same to us, for it were in vain to conceal it from us,
to the end that the French might be alarmed when
it is before expressly told the French, that the
design was against them.
</p><p>  III. To give a doubtful answer; but that resolves
on the second. For when a prince, out of an apprehension that extraordinary preparations may be used,
desires a clear, categorical, and satisfactory answer
concerning the matter (as the manner of princes is)
a dubious answer does not at all satisfy the enquiry
or allay his jealousy. But in what case it is, and is
used to be taken and understood that the forces are
designed against him.  And if his Majesty have
given no answer at all (which is not probable) it is
the same with the last. So that this being so, by
one means or other, the French have the knowledge
of the king's purpose. And if it but be known so or
but guessed at by them why is this concealed from
the Parliament ? Why this darkness towards us ?
</p><p>  Besides, we expect so much as we would hope for,
so long as we are afraid the French should have
known what we are a doing.
</p><p>  In this state of uncertainty and unripeness the
House adjourned to Wednesday morning, nine of
the clock, and having first ordered the Committee
for the Bill for recalling his Majesty's forces out of



<pb id="p.147" n="147"/>



the French king's service, to sit this afternoon, which
did sit accordingly and went through the Bill.
</p>
     <p>                   Wednesday, May 23, '77.
 </p><p> His Majesty sent a message for the House to
attend him presently at the Banqueting House at
Whitehall: where he made a speech to them. After
which, the Commons returning to the House and
the speech being there read, they presently resolved
to consider it, and after a little while resolved into a
Committee of the whole House for the more full,
free, and regular debate.
</p><p>  The secretary and others propounded to supply
the king, wherein they said they did not press the
House but they might do as they pleased.
 </p><p> But if it were expected that alliances should be
made and known, there must be &#x00A3;600,000 raised to
make preparations before; for the king declared,
that without it, it was not possible for him to speak
or act, &amp;c. He could not safely step a step further.
The king had the right of making peace, and war,
and leagues, as this House has of giving money.
 </p><p> He could not have money without them, and [they]
the alliancy without him.
 </p><p> The king considered this matter, and this was his
judgment: That he ought by such a sum to be put
into a posture to maintain and prosecute his alliances;
before they could or should be declared our nakednesses or weaknesses would be exposed, (because)
'tis true, as has been objected, the asking and giving
money for this purpose would alarm as much as the





<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>

declaration of alliances. But then it will defend
too; a whip may alarm a wild beast, but it will not
defend the man.
</p><p>  We know the king would strip himself to his shirt
rather than hazard the nation. He has done much
already, he has set out and made ready to set out
forty-four ships. But they must be distributed to
several places for convoys, &amp;c. There would need
(it may be) forty more in a body, and it is difficult
to get seamen, many are gone into the service of the
French and Dutch, and the king is forced to press
now.
</p><p>  The king hath not had any fruits of the &#x00A3;200,000
credit provided him upon the three years' excise.
</p><p>  He has tried the city to borrow money of them
thereupon, and my lord mayor returned answer that
he could not encourage his Majesty to depend upon
the city for it.
 </p><p> Several others somewhat differing speak to this
effect.
 </p><p> We should consider in this case as in the case of
the king's letters patent, proclamations, &amp;c. If any
thing in them be against law and reason the lawyers
and courts end it void, and reckon it not to be said
or done by the king.
 </p><p> For the king can do nothing wrong, though his
council may.
 </p><p> So we must look in the king's speeches and messages as the product of council, and therefore (if any
mistake be) it must be imputed to the error of his
council, and it must be taken the king never said it.



<pb id="p.149" n="149"/>



 </p><p> Now to apply: certainly the treating and concluding
of alliances requires not a previous sum of money;
however the king's council may misinform him, they
may be propounded and accepted here by the means
of the foreign ministers even without an embassy to
be sent hence.
 </p><p> And yet if they were requisite it were not an extraordinary charge.
 </p><p> Alliances may be made forthwith, and then money
would be granted forthwith.
  </p><p>If they were declared to-day the &#x00A3;600,000 would
be given to-morrow, and more as occasion should
require.
 </p><p> And there is no fear but money would be found
for this purpose.
 </p><p> Our own extravagances would maintain a war.
 </p><p> The money that has been provided the king
already this session is sufficient for all preparations
that can possibly be made before those alliances are
made.
 </p><p> Forty ships of ours, with the help of the Dutch,
are a good defence against the French at sea now he
is entangled in Sicily, the West Indies, &amp;c.
 </p><p> In the triple league it was stipulated that forty of
our ships and forty of the Dutch should be provided,
and they were thought sufficient for the purpose.
 </p><p> If itwere requisite that forty more ships should be set
out &#x00A3;600,000 is enough to maintain and pay them a
whole year, for the carpenters' work and the like, as
should presently be requisite for fitting them to go
out a little money would serve. And surely this is



<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>

the only preparation that can be meant: that we
should fortify the land with forts, garrisons, walled
towns, &amp;c. It is not six millions will do it; but our
strength, force, and defence is our ships.
 </p><p> For the debate of this day it is as great and weighty
as ever was any in England. It concerns our very
being, and includes our religion, liberty. and property. The door towards France must be shut and
guarded; for so long as it is open our treasure and
trade will creep out and their religion will creep in at
it. And this time is our season; some mischief will
be done, and so there will be at any time when the
war is begun, but now the least.
 </p><p> The French is not very dangerous to us now, nor
to be much feared at this present.  But we ought to
advise and act so now, as we need not fear or despair
hereafter: when the French will make peace beyond
sea and likely he will make alliances with those
people, with whom we defer to make them. How
ripe and great will our misery be then.
 </p><p> The power and policy of the French is extraordinary, his money influenceth round about him;
we are glad to observe what is said by the king.
That his Majesty agrees with us in the end, and we
hope he will be convinced of the unreasonableness
of the means which is to make, and follow these
alliances without plainly, we can give no account to
ourselves or those we represent, of giving money.
We have made several addresses about some of the
king's ministers, their management, &amp;c., of which
we have seen but little fruit.
</p>

<pb id="p.151" n="151"/>



 <p> There have continually almost to this hour gone
out of England, succours to France, of men, powder,
ammunition, ordnance, &amp;c., not to rake into the
matter how far the ministers have been active or
passive in this nor to mention any other particulars,
we must say (that unless) the ministers, or their
minds, are altered we have no reason to trust money
in their hands; though we declare we have no reason
to declare or attempt upon them. But could rather
propose to them an easy way how they might have
an oblivion, nay, and the thanks of the people (viz):
That they should endeavour and contend who could
do most to dispose the king to comply with this
advice of his Parliament.
 </p><p> We think (the prosecuting these alliances) the
only good use for which money can be employed.
And therefore before we give we would be secured
it should be employed to their purpose, and not by
miscounsels be directed to others.
 </p><p> This is the mature counsel of Parliament and no
cross or evil counsel is to be received or trusted for
attaining these great ends which the king and
Parliament are agreed on.
 </p><p> It was an error committed in the late king's time,
and which looks as if men had given counsel on
purpose to destroy that good king had he not by the
care and faithfulness of bishop Juxon and others
collected and preserved a good sum of money before
the Scotch rebellion, in <date value="1639">1639</date>.
 </p><p> Upon that rebellion he was advised to raise an
army at land, which was indeed necessary. But lie





<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>
was likewise advised to set out several of his great
rate ships.  This appeared in the papers of sir
Robert Long's office, and may there be seen still if
the papers are not scattered. A man cannot tell for
what end this advice was given, unless to spend the
king's money. For the Admiralty of Scotland is not
now, and much less was it then, so considerable as
to require any such force against it.
 </p><p> And if the design was to hinder their commerce
and succours by sea the charge of one of those great
ships might have been divided and applied to the
setting out of five or six lesser ships, each of which
was capable of doing as much for that service as such
a great one, and would abide at sea longer.
 </p><p> This is a plain case, that unless the power of France
be lowered we cannot be safe, and without our conjunction with the other confederates that cannot be
done.
 </p><p> The question is whether the present time is the
proper time for this work? Certainly it is. For now
there is a happy confederation against the French
which we cannot hope so well to have continued,
without our coming into it, if once the same be
broken.
 </p><p> The very season of the year favours the business.
It's proper and safe to begin with the French in the
summer, now he is engaged and not at leisure.
Whereas, in the winter, when the armies are drawn
out of the field, he will be able to apply himself to us.
 </p><p> As to the citizens not advancing money upon the
old credit (we are informed) they were never regularly or effectually asked.
</p>


<pb id="p.153" n="153"/>



 <p> My lord mayor indeed was spoken to, and perhaps
some of the aldermen. But they are not the city.
He sent about cursorily to some of the citizens to
know if they would lend, of which they took little or
no notice; for the custom in such a case has always
been that some lords of the council do go down to
the common council, which is the representative
body of the city, and there propound the matter.
 </p><p> Besides, in this particular case the citizens generally asked the same questions we do: are the
alliances made ? And said if they were made, then
would they lend money, but if not they saw no cause
for it.
 </p><p> Philip the Second of Spain made an observation
in his will, or some last memorial, and it is since
published by Monsieur.
 </p><p> He observes the vanity of any princes aspiring at
the universal monarchy, for that it naturally made the
rest of the world jointly his enemies.  Ambition
blinds men (and) suffers them not to look back upon
such experiences. But the observation shows what
is natural for others to do in such a case, and that
the way to repel and break such a design is by the
mindful consideration.
 </p><p> Philip the Second was capable of making this
observation, for in his hands perished the Spanish
design of universal monarchy, and that chiefly by the
conjunction of the English and Dutch against him.
 </p><p> In the process of which debate several gentlemen
did more particularly explain themselves, and propounded to advise their desire to the king, for a





<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>
league offensive and defensive with the Dutch, and
against the French power.
 </p><p> Against which a specious objection was made.
 </p><p> That the Dutch were already treating with the
French: and it is likely they would slip their necks
from the collars, make a separate peace for themselves, and leave us engaged in a war with France.
 </p><p> To which it was answered, that there was no just
fear of that. The Dutch were interested in repressing the power of France as well as we; and they
know their interest. It was reasonable for them to
say, if England (which is as much concerned in this
danger) will not assist us, we will make the best
terms for ourselves we can.
 </p><p> There is yet a seam of land between the French
and us: we may trade by or under the French, &amp;c.
But if England will join with the Dutch, they cannot
find one syllable of reason to desert the common
cause.
 </p><p> They have observed a propensity in the people of
England to help them, but not in the Court of England. If they can find that the Court does heartily
join, it will above all things oblige and confirm them.
 </p><p> In 667, when the Dutch were in peace and plenty,
when Flanders was a greater bulwark to them, for
the French had not pierced so far into it, and when
the direction of their affairs was in the hands of an
inveterate enemy to the crown of England (John de
Witt) yet then their interests did so far govern him
and them, as to enter into the Triple League against
the growth and power of France, and keep it more
down most certainly.
</p>


<pb id="p.155" n="155"/>



 <p> Therefore now they are exhausted and weakened
by war and stand in need of our help; now the French
have approached near the banks of their country, and
are increased in naval forces, to the danger of their
trade and navigation; and now their affairs are chiefly
directed by a kinsman of the crown of England (the
Prince of Orange) they cannot deflect or depart from
a league they make with us against our common
enemy.
 </p><p> It was moved, That there might be a league offensive and defensive with Spain and the Dutch, and
other convenient alliances with the rest of the confederates. But the particulars concerning Spain
was contracted and laid aside by the concurrent
discourse of the members to this purpose.
 </p><p> We court an alliance with Spain above all others,
for they are the owners of the Netherlands, for whose
preservation we have addressed.  That it is with
Spain we have the most if not the only profitable
trade. And the Spaniards are gallant, good, and
sure friends, but they are remote; and we know not
whether there are full powers here or at Brussels for
this matter. And to wait for their coming from
Madrid would make church-work (as they call it),
whereas we need the swiftest expedition.
 </p><p> Therefore they voted their addresses to be particular and expressly for such a league with the Dutch
and the Spaniards, together with the other confederates in general.
 </p><p> This passed with a very good consent. There was
an extraordinary full house, and upon putting the




<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>
question there was but two negative voices to it.
 </p><p> There were other more extraordinary particulars
appointed to be in the address, but no contest or
debate about them. </p>
             <p> The vote is as follows :</p>
  <p>.Resolved, That an address be made to the king that
his Majesty will be pleased to enter into a league
offensive and defensive, with the States General of
the United Provinces, and to make such other alliances with such other of the confederates as his
Majesty shall think fit against the growth and power
of the French king, and for the preservation of the
Spanish Netherlands: and that a committee be appointed to draw up an address with reasons why this
House cannot comply with his Majesty's speech
until such alliances were entered into. And further
showing the necessity of a speedy making of such
alliances; and when such alliances are made giving
his Majesty assurance of speedy and cheerful supplies
from time to time for supporting and maintaining
these alliances.
 </p><p> To which the speaker resumed the chair, and this
being reported the House agreed and appointed a
committee and adjourned over Ascension Day to
Friday, nine o'clock.
</p><p>
                         Friday [May] 25, <date value="1677">1677</date>.
 </p><p> Sir John Turner reported from the said committee; but before it was agreed to there was a
debate and division of the House.
 </p><p> It was observed and objected that there was but



<pb id="p.157" n="157"/>



one reason given herein for declining the granting
money, and that is the unprecedentedness. And as
to one of the instances to this purpose mentioned
(viz.) :
</p><p>  The king's first Dutch war, it was said to be mistaken, for that &#x00A3;200,000 was voted before the war
declared. But it was answered that if the declaration
was not before the grant of the money (which remains
a query), yet 'twas certain the war itself and great
hostilities were before the money. And some said
there might be other reasons assigned against giving
money before those alliances, but they rather desired
to spare them; only in general said it was not reasonable to grant money before there was a change, they
would not say of counsellors but of counsels .
Then a gentleman produced and read the king's
speech made on Monday, Feb. the 1st, <date value="1676">1676</date>, wherein
he speaks chiefly of the league, which afterwards,
when the Swedes came into it, was called the Triple
League.
</p><p>  It begins thus:-
      My Lords and Gentlemen,
</p><p>  I am glad to see you here again, to tell you what
I have done in this interval, which I am confident
you will be pleased with, since it is so much for the
honour and security of this nation. I have made a
league with the States of the United Provinces, and
likewise a mediation of peace between the two
crowns. Into which league that of Swedeland, by
his ambassador, has offered to enter as a principal.
I did not at our last meeting move you for any aids,




<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>
though I lie under great debts contracted in the last
war. But now the posture of our neighbours abroad
and the consequences of this new alliance, will oblige
me for our security to set out a considerable fleet to
sea this summer : and besides I must build more
great ships. And 'tis necessary that I do something
in order to the fortifying of some of our ports, I have
begun something myself in order to those ends.
But if I have not your speedy assistance I shall not
be able to go through with it. Wherefore I do
earnestly desire you to take into your speedy consideration, &amp;c.
</p><p>  Which shows a proper course and practice that
kings communicate first their alliances, before they
demand supplies upon the account of them. So this
exception was let fall.
</p><p>  But the main objection managed against it, was
upon the main point of the address. In which they
desired his Majesty to make a league offensive and
defensive with the Dutch, and such other alliances
with the rest as he should think fit.
</p><p>  Those which were in the particulars or particularising spoke to this effect.
</p><p>  This is an invasion of his Majesty's prerogative, in
making peace and war and leagues, and it's the
worse for the distinction, which is used in respect of
the Dutch and the rest. By which you giving him
express direction as to the Dutch and reserving to
his discretion as to the others, it looks and gives an
unbrage as if what we were to do were by your league.





<pb id="p.159" n="159"/>



The ancient land-mark and boundary between the
king and his people must not be removed.
</p><p>  This power is one of the few things reserved to
the Crown. Parliaments are sufficient to treat de
arduis. But it is but de quibusdam arduis. This is
unprecedented.
</p><p>  The marriage of the Royal Family is such a particular thing reserved to the king, and the matter of
the lady Arabella is an instance.
</p><p>  Queen Elizabeth resented it high, that the Parliament should propound her marriage. And she said,
however, it was well they did not name the person.
If they had named the person it had been intolerable.
</p><p>  Now here you name the persons with whom you
would have the king to ally. If you may go so far,
you may come to draw up a treaty and propose to
the king to assign it.
</p><p>  Lawyers can acquaint you with a precedent in
Richard the Second's time, wherein the king nominated to the Commons a matter of peace and war to
be treated on, and they refer it back to him as a
thing not fit to consult of.
</p><p>  By this you will put a great indecorum on the
king. He is now concerned as a mediator at Nimeguen, and it would be an indecent thing for him at
the same time to declare himself a party. It's believed the House of Austria, though they sent a full
power for that purpose, yet never intended to conclude
a peace, but it were an absurd thing of them to
declare so in public.
</p><p>  There must be a public decorum. This is the way




<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>




to have the king to have the worse bargain with the
confederates. For the observing him now he is
importuned, and, as it were, driven to make those
alliances, will slacken and lessen to make those
advantageous offers which otherwise they will be
forced to give.
 </p><p> And again they said his Majesty did agree with the
House in the end, and did not doubt but he would
prosecute it by the same means as was desired. But
his prerogative was not to be encroached upon.
This manner of proceeding would never obtain with
the king.
</p><p>  On the other side several spoke to this effect: "We
ought to consider we are upon the question of agreeing an address drawn by our committee and by our
order. If they have not in matter and manner corresponded with our direction and intention we have
cause to disagree. But were the exception taken,
and cause pressed, why we should not agree with
them is because they have observed the very words
and substance of our order, which exactly justifies
this draft.
</p><p>  I. This passed on Wednesday upon a full debate,
in a very full House.
</p><p>  II. Only contradicting, but not one then speaking,
or thinking that the king's prerogative was touched;
and therefore it is strange it should be made the
great objection and question of this day.
</p><p>  But the prerogative is not at all entrenched upon;
we do not pretend to treat or make alliance, we only
offer our advice about them, and leave it with the

<pb id="p.161" n="161"/>

king; he may do what he pleaseth. Either make, or
not make them. It is no more than other persons
may do to the king, doubtless the Privy Council may
advise in this particular, and why not this great
council ? This rate of discourse would make the
king's prerogative merely consist in not being advised
by his Parliament of all people.
</p><p>  There are manifold precedents of such advices and
leagues which have been made by advice of Parliament
and have been ratified in Parliament in E. III., R. II.,
and in Henry the Fifth's time, and especially with
Sigismund the emperor, and the king of the Romans.
And Henry the Fifth was a magnanimous prince, and
not to be imposed upon.
</p><p>  Jac. 18, the Parliament advised the king about the
making and managing war. And we may well remember our own advising the first Dutch war. But
if that were no precedent in this particular case, it
were no good objection, for matter of advice is not
to be a circumferised precedent. If there be a new
case, there must be a new council. Perhaps there is
no precedent for such a case, if a prince should join
in war, together with another prince, when the other
prince was too potent before. And when this was
discerned and a peace made, yet supplies should
continually go out of the first prince's dominions to
the service of that other prince, and that notwithstanding several addresses and advices to the contrary.
</p><p>  'Tis true as objected, that the Commons have
sometimes declined in advising in matters of war,





<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>
&amp;c., proposed to them, but that shows not their
want of right to meddle therewith, but rather the
contrary. The very truth is, it hath been the desire
and endeavours of kings in all ages to engage their
Parliaments in advising war, &amp;c., that so they might
be obliged to supply the king to the utmost for and
through it.
</p><p>  But they out of a prudent caution have sometimes
waived the matter, lest they should engage further
and deeper than they were aware of or willing.
</p><p>  Since his Majesty's treating as mediator at Nimeguen about the general peace, it is a great reason
why we should specify the alliances desired, as we
have done, that we might make it known we are far
from desiring such alliances as might be made by
and with a general peace. But on the contrary
coveting such as might present and secure us against
that dangerous and formidable peace. Doubtless
the confederates will offer honourable and worthy
terms. Their necessity is too great for them to
boggle, or take advantage. Nor will they think this
league the less worthy because we advise it, but
rather value it the more because it is done unanimously by the king, with the advice and applause of
his people in Parliament.
</p><p>  We cannot suppose that our propounding this to
his Majesty will prejudice our address or endanger
its miscarriage, since it is for his Majesty's advantage.
In that it obliges us to supply him, in all degrees,
through his affairs. And the more particular it is,
the more still for the king's advantage. For if it had



<pb id="p.163" n="163"/>



been more general, and the king thereupon made
alliances, whatever they were, men might have
thought or said that they were not the alliances
intended, and might be used as an excuse, or reason,
for their not giving money. But this (as it is now)
does not expressly, strictly, and particularly bind
us up.
</p><p>  We reflect that a great deal of time, and precious
time, has been spent since our addressing on this
subject, and finding no effectual fruit (especially of
our last address) we have cause to apprehend we are
not clearly understood in what we mean. Now it is
the ordinary way in pursuing discourse in such a
case, and it is proper and natural for us, to speak
out more explicitly and particularly, and tell his
Majesty that what we meant is a league offensive and
defensive, &amp;c. And to persuade us to address on in
a more general term than before, is to persuade us
that as we have done nothing these ten weeks, so we
should do nothing still. And since his Majesty, in
his last message and last speech, hath been pleased
to demand &#x00A3;600,000 for answering the purpose of
our address, and assures us the money shall not be
employed to other use than we would have it
employed in, it is most reasonable for us to declare
plainly the use and purpose we intend, that so it
may be consented and clearly understood of all
hands. And therefore it is well to mention to his
Majesty these express alliances. We think no other
alliances worth the said sum. And we withal
promising and undertaking that his Majesty shall




<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>
have this and no more for those ends. Nor have we
any cause to apprehend that his Majesty will take ill
this our advice in league.
</p><p>  In this manner we have presented more than our
address for alliances against the growth and power
of the French.  And his Majesty hath received,
admitted, and answered them without any manner of
exception. And if we may address for alliances with
a particular prince or state it cannot be less regular
or particular than the former.
</p><p>  And moreover, though we know the punctual precedent is on our side beside our commissioners, by
our writs, to treat de arduis et urgentilbus negotiis, regis statu; et defensionem regni, et ecclesu&#x00E6;Anglican
concerentibus. And besides the king's general intimations in his printed speech, yet if it be said to be a
decent and a proper thing to have his Majesty's
leave and consent before we proceed on such a
matter in such a manner as we now do; we say,
that in effect it is with us too. For consider all the
former addresses and his Majesty's answers and
messages thereupon, it will appear that his Majesty
hath engaged and encouraged us too upon this
subject. And that which we expect and would have
is not to limit, or check, or advise, but open and
enlarge our gift.
</p><p>  His Majesty appears content to be thoroughly
advised, provided he be proportionately furnished
and enabled with money, which we (being now
ready to do) clearly and conclusively present him our
address for the application of it, those mistakes and





<pb id="p.165" n="165"/>



mistrusts which his Majesty saith he finds some ready
to make, as if he had called us together only to get
money from us for other uses than we would have it
employed in.
</p><p>  And truly the advising these alliances, together
with assuring his Majesty thereupon to assist and
supply him presently and plentifully to prosecute the
same is our only way of complying and corresponding
with his last speech. For those followed and supported by these supplies are the only means and
method to put his Majesty in the best condition,
both to defend his subjects and to offend his enemies.
And so there will be no fault in his Majesty nor us;
but his and our security will sufficiently be provided
for.
</p><p>  Besides it will be worse, it will be a very bad thing
indeed, not to make the address. For this particular,
now since we have resolved it already, our intention
being to have the Dutch, &amp;c. (comforted, and encouraged, and assured), we did order this on
Wednesday.
</p><p>  And there is public notice taken of it abroad and
beyond sea: if we should not upon solemn debates
set the same aside it would beget a great doubt,
discomfort, and discouragement to them. It is one
thing never to have ordered it, another to retract it:
also it was said that this was necessary, for suppose
(which is not credible) the French should be prevailed with to deliver up all Lorraine, Flanders,
Alsace, and other conquered places, are we safe ?
No. He has too much money, and this money is in





<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>

great measure, a million sterling, supplied him from
hence. We must depress him by force, as soon as
may be. And further, we must have leagues and
laws to impoverish them. We must destroy the
French trade. This would quiet and secure us.
This would make our lands rise, and would enable
us to set our king at ease.
</p><p>  After this long debate the House came to the
question : whether this particular league, offensive
and defensive, should be left out of the address ?
Upon which question the House divided.
</p><p>  Yeas, 142. Noes, 182.
</p><p>  So that it was carried by 40 that it should stand.
</p><p>  The main question was put for agreeing with the
committee to the address, which passed in the
affirmative without division of the House.
</p><p>  Then it was ordered that those members of the
House who were of his Majesty's Privy Council
should move his Majesty to know his pleasure, when
the House might wait upon him with the address.
</p><p>  Mr. Poole reported from the committee, of amendments to the Bill for the recalling his Majesty's
subjects out of the French king's service, which were
read and agreed to by the House, and the Bill, with
the amendments, ordered to be engrossed.
</p><p>                         Saturday, May 26, <date value="1677">1677</date>.
</p><p>  The House being sate and notice by Mr. Secretary
Coventry that the king would receive their address at
three o'clock in the afternoon. Then the Bill for
recalling his Majesty's subjects (being engrossed) was
read a third time and passed.

<pb id="p.167" n="167"/>



<p>  The effect of it in short is this, that all and every
of his Majesty's born subjects who should continue
or be, after the first day of August next, in the military service of the French king, should be disenabled
to inherit any lands, tenements or hereditaments, and
be incapable of any gift, grant, or legacy, or to be
executor or administrator, and (being convicted)
should be adjudged guilty of felony without benefit
of clergy, and not pardonable by his Majesty, his
heirs, or successors, except only by Act of Parliament,
wherein such offender should be particularly named.
</p><p>  The like appointment touching such as should
continue in the sea service of the French king after
the tenth day of May, <date value="1678">1678</date>. This act as to prohibiting
that offence and inflicting the penalties, to continue
but for two years. But the executing and proceeding
upon it, for offences against the act, might be at any
time after as within two years.
</p><p>  Then it was ordered that Mr. Poole should carry
the bill to the Lords, and with all put the Lords in
mind of a Bill for the better suppressing the growth
of Popery, which they had sent up to the Lords before
Easter, which was forthwith done accordingly.
</p><p>  As soon as this was ordered, several other bills were
moved to be read, etc., but the members generally
said No, they would proceed on nothing but the
French and Popery and so adjourned to the afternoon,
when they attended the king with their address in
the Banqueting House, at Whitehall, which being
presented, the king answered that it was long, and of
great importance ; that he would consider of, and
give them an answer as soon as he could.
</p>



<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>



<p>                         Monday, May 28, <date value="1677">1677</date>.
</p><p>  The House being sat, they received notice by Mr.
Secretary Coventry, that the king expected them
immediately at the Banqueting House, (which when
being come) the king made a speech to them on the
subject of the address, which speech to prevent
mistakes his Majesty read out of the paper, and then
delivered the same to the Speaker, and his Majesty
added a few words about the adjournment, upon this
they returning to the House, the Speaker read the
king's speech, which was as follows:
</p>  <p>" Gentlemen,-</p>
<p>  " Could I have been silent I would rather have
chosen to be so than to call to mind things so unfit
for you to meddle with, as are contained in some
parts of your last address, wherein you have entrenched
upon so undoubted a right of the Crown that I am
confident it will appear in no age (when the sword
was not drawn) that the prerogative of making peace
and war hath been so dangerously invaded.
</p><p>  " You do not content yourselves with desiring me
to enter into such leagues as may be for the safety of
the kingdom, but you tell me what sort of leagues
they must be, and with whom; and, as your address
is worded, it is more liable to be understood to be
by your leave than at your request that I should
make such other alliances as I please with other of
the confederates.
</p><p>  "Should I suffer this fundamental power of making
peace and war to be so far invaded (though but
once) as to have the manner and circumstances of





<pb id="p.169" n="169"/>



leagues prescribed to me by Parliament, it's plain
that no prince or state would any longer believe that
the sovereignty of England rests in the Crown. Nor
could I think myself to signify any more to foreign
princes than the empty sound of a king. Wherefore
you may rest assured that no condition shall make
me depart from or lessen so essential a part of the
monarchy.   And I am willing to believe so well
of this House of Commons, that I am confident
these ill consequences are not intended by you.
</p><p>  "These are in short the reasons why I can by no
means approve of your address, and yet, though you have
declined to grant me that supply which is so necessary to the ends of it, I do again declare to you that
as I have done all that lay in my power since your
last meeting, so I will still apply myself by all the
means I can to let the world see my care both for
the security and satisfaction of my people, although
it may not be with those advantages to them which
by your assistance I might have procured."
</p><p>  And then the Speaker reported that his Majesty
added by word of mouth,
</p><p>  That his Majesty was further pleased to declare
his pleasure to them that the House should be
adjourned till the 16th of July next, telling them he
would give them notice by his proclamation when
his Majesty intended they should sit again, which
his Majesty was pleased to say should not be till the
winter, unless there were some extraordinary occasion
of calling them sooner.
</p><p>  And accordingly being returned to Westminster





<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>
the House of Commons was adjourned till the 16th
of July next.
</p><p>  Then a member standing up to speak, and many
calling for him to be heard, the Speaker said no,
none ought to be heard after the king had required
and ordered their adjournment, and said the king
had ordered them to adjourn. Whereupon several
said that he could not adjourn them; but it was
they must adjourn themselves, and that he could not
leave the chair but by a question and the vote of the
House, and offered to show a precedent of sitting
after direction from the king to adjourn. But the
Speaker said no, they were not to be, since the king
had determined as he had, and said they were
adjourned till the 16th of July next, and so went
hastily from the chair.
</p><p>
                         Monday, July 16, <date value="1677">1677</date>.
</p><p>  The Parliament meet again but only in order to
adjourn. In the House of Commons the prayers
were read and the ordinary prayer for the blessing
the councils of Parliament, and then the Speaker
took the chair, and Mr. Secretary Coventry signified
to the House his Majesty's pleasure that they should
adjourn themselves immediately till December 3rd,
which message the Speaker reported, and then sat
down again, perhaps in expectation of a motion to
be made to adjourn accordingly.
</p><p>  But there was no such motion expressly made;
only some cried the Question,the Question, etc.
</p><p>  My lord Ca[vend]ish moved that their last order


        <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

might be read, meaning the order about the last
adjournment, to the end they might take notice of
the authority by which they met there now; and this
was said was usual and regular to be done.
</p><p>  Mr. Williams seconded the motion, and said he did
it rather because there had been some discourse of
some informality in the last adjournment. Thereupon
presently the Speaker rose up and said, "Gentlemen,
the king has commanded that the House be adjourned
till the 3rd of December," and then went immediately
from the chair and out of the House in the same
manner as the last time; several members saying it
ought to have been done by a question and some
speaking hard words after the Speaker.  There were
near two hundred members in the House.

of his arms in Flanders; and desired he might have
money to enable him to fulfil his engagements.
</p><p>  The Commons immediately voted an address of
thanks to the king for the care he had taken of the
Protestant religion in marrying his niece to the
Prince of Orange, but observed they could grant no
supplies for the war if his Majesty and his allies
would not engage not to lay down their arms till the
treaty of the Pyrenees was performed, and till the
French king was reduced to the condition he was
then in; for, that without this, neither this kingdom

fear the army now raised was rather intended to

being put to the question, whether an address should
be made to the king for laying aside duke Lauderdale of the kingdom of Scotland it was carried in
the negative by one vote only.
</p><p>  The question was put again and carried, that such
councillors as had advised the king to make such
answers to the late addresses from his Parliament,
being betrayers of the king and kingdom, or to that
effect, an address should be humbly presented to his
Majesty, to lay them aside from his councils, and
remove them from their other employments. This
address was accordingly, and his Majesty's answer
was this, that they were so extravagant in the contents of it that he was not willing to make such reply
to it as it deserved. Lauderdale was particularly
named. And the same day it was carried, though
but by one vote in a full House, that the king's
message lately sent to them to consider of some
means for a supply to his Majesty for paying off his
fleet, should not be observed. The king understanding the tide of their proceedings to run so very high,
prorogued them to the 23rd of the same month,
which put a stop to their further proceedings.

                                        May 23.
 </p><p> The Parliament met pursuant to adjournment, when
the king spoke to them a little more briskly than
usual. He told them a peace was near upon conclusion between France and the Confederates, at
which they were extremely concerned.  This peace
with France, when there was like to be so strong an
union combined to reduce that proud and potent
king to a better sense of himself, was very ungrateful
news to England; and therefore the king, to throw
the blame of it upon the Commons, told us in his
speech it was owing to his refusal of money, till
something was done for the security of their religion;
their negligence to direct or advise him concerning
the intended war, or to assist him till he had changed
councillors, and consequently the little hopes the
confederates could have of help from him; that this,
togetherwith the low condition of Spain, had prompted
them to lend an ear to the offers of peace; not to
speak of the sluggish motion of the Germans, the
difficulty of getting them together, their princes being
influenced by such discordant views and interests,
and the present poverty of the States General, all
which had contributed towards the cessation of the
war.
</p><p>  But still our king was chiefly condemned in this
great affair, as he so long deferred to engage in this


      <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

alliance, which, had he sooner done, the French
king had never dared to persist in the war. At
least, he could not have made so great a progress in
Flanders, or have been able to make so good a
market for himself as he did by this peace.
</p><p>  To this our king made answer he could not have
believed the French king would have been able to
weather out a war so well as he did, though in a
manner against all Europe, himself and the king
only excepted, who sat neuters; and that in case
this number of enemies had humbled that kingdom,
England might well have been satisfied with the
having been an unconcerned looker-on while she
engrossed all the commerce of Europe, and might in
the end have reaped an equal share of advantage
with even the labourers themselves who had been at
all the pains and expense.

great penalties were levelled against the officers of

was to pass, to prevent their diverting it from its
right channel, and this done, the money was cheerfully given, the nation and its representatives dreading
nothing so much at that time as a standing army.

<p>THE series, of which the present volume is one, aims at setting
forth the facts of our National History, political and social, in a
way not yet systematically tried in this country, but somewhat
like that which Messrs. Hachette have successfully wrought out
in France under the editorship of MM. Zeller, Darsy, Luchaire,
etc. It is planned not only for educational use but for the
general reader, and especially for all those to whom the original
contemporary authorities are for various reasons difficult of access.</p>
<p> To each well-defined period of our history is given a little
volume made up of extracts from the chronicles, state papers,
memoirs, and letters of the time, as also from other contemporary literature, the whole chronologically arranged and chosen
so as to give a living picture of the effect produced upon each
generation by the political, religious, social and intellectual
movements in which it took part.</p>
 <p> Extracts from foreign tongues are Englished, and passages
from old English authors put into modern spelling, but otherwise
as far as may be kept in original form. When needed a glossary
is added and brief explanatory notes. To each volume is also
appended a short account of the writers quoted and of their
relations to the events they describe, as well as such tables and
summaries as may facilitate reference. Such illustrations as are
given are chosen in the same spirit as the text, and represent
monuments, documents, sites, portraits, coins, etc.</p>
 <p> The chief aim of the series is to send the reader to the best
original authorities, and so to bring him as close as may be to
the mind and feelings of the times he is reading about.</p>
 <p> No definite chronological system of issue is adopted, but it is
hoped that the entire period of Medi&#x00E6;val and Renaissance history may be covered in the space of two or three years.
