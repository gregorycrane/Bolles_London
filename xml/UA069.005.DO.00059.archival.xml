<pb id="p.1" n="1"/>
<p>Let us find ourselves again at <placeName key="bart,Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>, which forms the south-eastern angle of <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="bart,Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</placeName></rs>, a dreary expanse of granite with <num value="2">two</num> granite fountains, intended to commemorate the last victory of Nelson. Its northern side is occupied by the miserable buildings of the <placeName key="cruch,National gallery">National Gallery</placeName>; its eastern and   western sides by a hideous hotel and a frightful club.   Where the noble Jacobian screen of <placeName key="cruch,Northumberland house">Northumberland House</placeName> (which was so admirably adapted for a National Portrait Gallery) once drew the eye away from these abominations by its dignity and beauty, a view of the funnel-roof of <placeName key="bart,Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> Railway Station forms a poor substitute for the time-honoured palace of the Percy's!   In the centre of the square is a Corinthian pillar of Devonshire granite, <num value="145">145</num> feet in   height, by <hi rend="italics">W. Railton</hi>, erected in <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct>. It supports a statue of Nelson by <hi rend="italics">E. H.. Baily, R.A</hi>., a very poor work, which, however, does not much signify, as it can only be properly seen from the top of the Duke of York's column, which no <num value="1">one</num> ascends.   The pedestal of the column is decorated by reliefs. <pb id="p.2" n="2"/>
   <quote rend="blockquote"><p><hi rend="italics">North</hi>. The Battle of Nile by <hi rend="italics">Woodington</hi>.</p>

</p>
   <p>The noble lions at the foot of the column were added by
<hi rend="italics">Sir E. Landseer</hi> in <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>. Only <num value="1">one</num> of them was modelled: a slight variation in the treatment adapted the others to their pedestals. Their chief grandeur lies in their mighty simplicity.
<figure id="Fig.001" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.034.DO01.00001"><head>One of Landseer's Lions</head></figure>
</p>
   <p>At the south-west angle of the square is a statue of Sir  C. S. Napier by <hi rend="italics">Adams</hi>; at the south-east angle a statue of  Sir Henry Havelock by <hi rend="italics">Behnes.</hi>   On a pedestal at the north-west corner is an equestrian statue of George IV. by
 <hi rend="italics">Chantrey</hi>, intended to surmount the <placeName key="bart,Marble Arch">Marble Arch</placeName> when it stood in front of Buckingham Palace. The corresponding pedestal is vacant, and likely to remain so: there has never been a pendant to George IV.</p>
    <p>On the east side of <placeName key="bart,Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</placeName> is its <num value="1">one</num> ornament.  Here, on a noble basement, approached by a broad flight of steps, rises the beautiful portico of the <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>
<rs type="subject">>Church of St. Martin in the Fields</rs>.     It is the masterpiece   of <hi rend="italics">Gibbs</hi>
(<dateStruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></dateStruct>-<num value="26">26</num>), and is the only perfect example of a Grecian portico in London. The regular rectangular plan on which <placeName key="bart,Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</placeName> was <num value="1">first</num> laid out was abandoned simply to bring it into view; yet, in <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>, the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the sake of giving uniformity to a new street, seriously contemplated the destruction of the well-graded basement to which it owes all its beauty of proportion, and which is <num value="1">one</num> of the chief features of a Greek portico. However, Parliament happily interfered, and the portico survives.</p>
   <p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>Beautiful for situation, elegant in proportion, and perfect in construction, it is precisely the kind of building that the angle of <placeName key="bart,Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</placeName> requires. It is thoroughly in its place, is in harmony with all its surroundings, and lends more grace than it receives to  <quote> the finest site in Europe.</quote>  From whatever point it is seen, it impresses the beholder as a work of art, impelling him to draw nearer and examine it in detail, and unlike many other architectural structures it does not disappoint upon examination.</quote><bibl>-Morning Post, <dateStruct value="1877-02--"><month reg="02">Feb.</month>, <year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>.</bibl></cit></quote>
</p>
   <p>The building of <placeName key="cruch,St. Martin's church">St. Martin's</placeName> is commemorated in the lines of Savage--
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>O Gibbs! whose art the solemn fane can raise,</l>
<l>Where God delights to dwell, and man to praise.</l></quote>
 But its portico is its best feature, and the effect even of this is injured by the tower, which seems to rise out of it. The sides of the church are poor; <quote>in all,</quote> as Walpole says, <quote>is wanting that harmonious simplicity which bespeaks a genius.</quote> The vane on the handsome steeple bears a crown, to show that this is the royal parish. In its upper story is preserved a <quote>sanctus bell</quote> from   the earlier church on this <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> site; it was rung at the point when the priest said <quote>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth,</quote> that the Catholic population outside might share in   the feeling of the service.</p>
   <p>The existence of a church here is mentioned as early as <dateStruct value="1222"><year reg="1222">1222</year></dateStruct>.   Henry VIII. was induced to rebuild it by the annoyance which he felt at the funerals constantly passing his windows of <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> on their way to <placeName key="cruch,St. Margaret's church">St. Margaret's</placeName>, and his church, still really <quote>in the Fields,</quote> to which a chancel was added by Prince Henry in <dateStruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></dateStruct>, became a favourite burial-place in the time of the Stuarts. It may be called the artists' church, for amongst those interred here were Nicholas Hiliard, miniature-painter to Elizabeth, <dateStruct value="1619--"><year reg="1619">1619</year></dateStruct>; Paul Vansomer, painter to James I., <dateStruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></dateStruct>; Sir John Davies the poet, author of <quote lang="LA">Nosce teipsum,</quote> so much extolled by Hallam and Southey, <dateStruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></dateStruct>; Nicholas Laniere the musician, <dateStruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></dateStruct>; Dobson, the <num value="1">first</num> eminent portrait-painter of English birth, called <quote>the English Vandyke,</quote> <dateStruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></dateStruct>; Nicholas Stone the sculptor, <dateStruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></dateStruct>; and Louis Laguerre, <dateStruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></dateStruct>. The Hon. Robert Boyle (<dateStruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></dateStruct>), the religious philosopher, author of many theological works, was buried here, and his funeral sermon was preached by Bishop Burnet, who was his intimate friend. <num value="2">Two</num> of the tombs from the ancient church, those of Sir Thomas Mayere, physician to James I. and Charles I.,  <dateStruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></dateStruct>-<num value="56">56</num>, and of Secretary Coventry, <dateStruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></dateStruct>, are preserved in the vaults of the present edifice. The register of the church records the baptism of the great Lord Bacon, born hard by at York House, in <dateStruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></dateStruct>.   It has been said that Prince Charles Edward renounced the religion of his forefathers here.<note id="n.4.1">Walpole's <title>Letters to Sir Horace Mann</title>.</note></p>
 <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>
   <p>Amongst those who were buried in the churchyard was (<dateStruct value="1615-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg="15">15</day>, <year reg="1615">1615</year></dateStruct>) the beautiful Mrs. Anne Turner, who was hanged at Tyburn for her part in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and who, <quote>having been the <num value="1">first</num> person. to bring yellow   starched ruffs into popularity, was condemned by Coke to be hang'd in her yellow Tiffiny ruff and cuffs,</quote> the hangman also having his bands and cuffs of the same, <quote>which made many to forbear the use of that horrid starch, till it at last grew   generally to be detested and disused.</quote> After he had lain in   state, the   murdered   body   of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey <note id="n.5.1">Macaulay and others write the name Edmundsbury. But in the cloisters of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName> there is a monument to a brother of Sir Edmund, where he is designated as Edmundus Berry Godfrey. The best authority, however, is Sir Edmund's father. The Diary of Thomas Godfrey of Lidd, in Kent, says, <quote>My wife was delivered of another son the <dateStruct value="1621-12-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1621">1621</year></dateStruct>, who was christened the <dateStruct value="-01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, being Sunday. His godfather was my cousin John Berrie, his other godfather my faithful loving friend and my neighbour sometime in <placeName key="bart,Greek Street">Greek Street</placeName>, Mr. Edmund Harrison, the king's embroiderer. They named my son Edmund Berrie, the <num value="1">one</num>'s name, and the other's Christian name.</quote> </note> was buried in this churchyard in <dateStruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></dateStruct>, with an immense public funeral, at the head of which walked <num value="72">seventy-two</num> clergymen of the Church of England, in full canonicals; John Lacy, the dramatist, was buried here in <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct>; Sir Winston Churchill, father of the great Duke of Marlborough, in <dateStruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct>; George Farquhar, the comedy-writer and friend of Wilkes, in <dateStruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></dateStruct>; and Lord Mohun, killed   in   duel with   the   Duke   of Hamilton, in <dateStruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></dateStruct>. In <dateStruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></dateStruct> Hogarth and Reynolds here followed Roubiliac to his grave, which was near that.of Nell Gwynne, who died of an apoplexy in her house in <placeName key="bart,Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></dateStruct>, being only in her <num value="38">thirty-eighth</num> year.. She left an annual sum of money to the bell-ringers which they still enjoy.   Archbishop Tenison, who had attended her death-bed, preached her funeral sermon here with great extolling of her virtues, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> a fact which, repeated to Queen Mary II. by the desire of his enemies to bring him into discredit, only drew from her the answer, <quote>I have heard as much. It is a sign that the unfortunate woman died penitent; for if I can read a man's heart through his looks, had she not made a pious and Christian end, the doctor would never have been induced to speak well of her.</quote></p>
   <p>The parish of <placeName key="cruch,St. Martin's church">St. Martin's</placeName>, now much subdivided, was formerly the largest in London. Burnet speaks of it in <dateStruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></dateStruct> as <quote>the greatest cure in England,</quote> and Baxter tells how its population consisted of <num value="40000">40,000</num> persons more than could find room in the church. The labyrinthine alleys near the church, destroyed in the formation of <placeName key="bart,Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</placeName>, were known as <quote>the Bermudas;</quote> hence the reference in Ben Jonson-

    <p>In the time of the Commonwealth <placeName key="bart,St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</placeName> was a shady lane with a hedge on either side. It was open country as far as the village of <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName>. In a proclamation of <dateStruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></dateStruct>, Henry VIII. desires to have <quote>the games of  Hare, Partridge, Pheasant and Heron,</quote> preserved from the  Palace of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> to <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName> in the Fields. In  Faithorne's Map of London, <dateStruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></dateStruct>, <placeName key="bart,St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</placeName> is the western boundary of the town.

    <p>The ambition of London tradesmen   might justly feel encouraged by the almost European reputation which was obtained in his own day by Thomas Chippendale, a cabinet. maker of <placeName key="bart,St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</placeName>, and which has not diminished, but increased, since his death.

   <p>The National Collection of pictures originated in the purchase   of Mr. Angerstein's   Gallery   on   the urgent advice of Sir George Beaumont, who added to it his own collection of pictures, in <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct>.

   <p>Hogarth was <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>a writer of comedy with a pencil, rather than a painter. If catching the manners and follies of an age <hi rend="italics">living as they rise</hi>, if general satire on vices and ridicules, familiarised by strokes of nature, and heightened by wit, and the whole animated by proper and just expressions of the passions, be comedy, Hogarth composed comedies as much as Moliere; in his Marriage a la Mode there is even an intrigue carried on throughout the piece. . .. Hogarth had no model to follow and improve upon. He created his art; and used colours instead of language. He resembles Butler, but his subjects are more universal, and amidst all his pleasantry, he observes the true end of comedy, reformation; there is always a moral to his pictures. Sometimes he rose to tragedy, not in the catastrophe of kings and heroes, but in marking how vice conducts insensibly and incidentally to misery and shame. He warns against encouraging cruelty and idleness in young minds; and discerns how the different vices of the great and the vulgar lead by various paths to the same unhappiness.</quote><bibl>-Walpole,

   <quote rend="blockquote"><p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>It was  the subjects of common life around him, and the widely. spread demand for such pictures which arose from all classes, which furnished the chief occupation of the Dutch painter, and that to such an extent that, considering the limited dimensions of the land itself, and the comparatively short time in which those works were produced, we are equally astonished with their number as with their surpassing excellence. .... In all these pictures, whatever their class of subjects, <num value="2">two</num> qualities invariably prevail; the most refined perception of the picturesque, and the utmost mastery of technical skill. Animated, also, by the instinctively right feeling which told the painter that a <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> small scale of size was best adapted to the subordinate moral interest of such subjects, we find them almost exclusively of limited dimensions.

<p>From   <placeName key="bart,Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>, the handsomest street in London, leads to the west.   Its name is a record of its having been the place where the game of Palle-malle was played--a game still popular in the deserted streets of old sleepy Italian cities, and deriving its name from   <foreign lang="IT">Palla</foreign>, a ball, and <foreign lang="IT">Maglia</foreign> a mallet.   It was already introduced into England in the reign of James I., who (in his <quote lang="GREEK">*basiliko\n *dw=ron</quote>) recommended his son Prince Henry to play at it. Charles II., who was passionately fond of the game, removed the site for it to <placeName key="cruch,St. James's park">St. James's Park</placeName>.<note id="n.43.1">Curious details as to the game are given in <bibl><title>Le Jen de Mail, par Joseph Lanthier</title>, <dateStruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></dateStruct>.</bibl> It was played with balls made from the root of box, which were gradually attuned to the stroke of the mallet, and were always rubbed with pellitory before being put away after use.</note>
</p>
   <p>It was across the ground afterwards set apart for Pallemalle, described by Le Serre as <quote>near the avenues of the (St. James's) palace--a large meadow, always green, in which ladies walk in summer,</quote> that Sir Thomas Wyatt led his rebel troops into London in <dateStruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></dateStruct>, passing with little loss under the fire of the artillery planted on <placeName key="bart,Hay Hill">Hay Hill</placeName> by the Earl of Pembroke, and forcing his way successfully through the guard drawn out to defend <placeName key="bart,Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>, but <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> only to be deserted by his men and taken prisoner as he entered the City.</p>
    <p>The street was not enclosed till about <dateStruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></dateStruct>, when it was at <num value="1">first</num> called <placeName key="bart,Catherine Street">Catherine Street</placeName>, in honour of Catherine of Braganza, and it still continued to be a fashionable promenade rather than a highway for carriage traffic.

Mrs. Dawson afterwards deposed, on oath, that she saw fire in the warming-pan when it was brought into her majesty's chamber, the time being then about <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock, and the birth of the prince did not take place until <num value="10">ten</num> .... After her majesty was in bed, the king came in, and she asked him if he had sent for the queen dowager. He replied,  <quote>I have sent for everybody,</quote>  and so, indeed, it seemed; for besides the queen dowager and her ladies, and the ladies of the queen's household, the state officers of the palace, several of the royal physicians, and the usual professional attendants, there were eighteen members of the Privy Council, who stood at the foot of the bed.   There were in all <num value="67">sixty-seven</num> persons present.   Even the  Princess Anne, in her coarse, cruel letters to her sister on this subject, acknowledged that the queen was much distressed by the presence of so many men, especially by that of the Lord Chancellor Jeffreys.</quote><bibl>-  Stickland's <title>Queens of England</title>.</bibl></cit></quote>

    <p>The Duchess of Kendal, the king's mistress, had rooms in the palace, and, towards the close of his reign, George I. assigned appartments there on the ground-floor to a fresh favourite, Miss   Anne   Brett.     When the king left for  Hanover, Miss Brett had a door opened from her rooms to the royal gardens, which the king's grand-daughter, Princess  Anne, who was residing in the palace, indignantly ordered to be walled up.   Miss Brett had it opened a <num value="2">second</num> time, and the quarrel was at its height, when the news of the king's death put an end to the power of his mistress.   With the accession of George II. the Countesses of Yarmouth and  Suffolk took possession of the apartments of the Duchess of Kendal.   As Prince of Wales, George II. had resided in the palace, till a smouldering quarrel with his father came to a crisis over the christening of <num value="1">one</num> of the royal children, and the next day he was put under arrest, and ordered to leave St. James's with his family the same evening.  Wilhelmina Caroline of Anspach, the beloved queen of  George II., died in the palace, <dateStruct value="1737-11-20"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1737">1737</year></dateStruct>, after an agonizing illness, endured with   the utmost fortitude and consideration for all around her.</p> <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>

   <p>The adjoining house, ugly and poverty-stricken as it looks now, was that in which Sir Isaac Newton passed the latter years of his life, in an honoured old age, from <dateStruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></dateStruct>, <num value="2">two</num> years before his death at Kensington.

Always frugal in his own habits, he devoted his wealth to the poor, especially to the French refugees in his neighbourhood.   In the observatory on the top of his house he was wont to say that   the happiest years of his life were spent. This observatory, once used as a Sunday school, was kept up till <dateStruct value="1824"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct> for the inspection of the foreign visitors who came by thousands to visit it, and who now, when they come to seek it, turn away disgusted at the treatment which the shrines of their illustrious dead meet with at the hands of Englishmen, for it was sold some years since to supply some pews for the chapel next door.</p>

In his <hi rend="italics">Esmond</hi>, Thackeray, true to his picture of the times, narrates how Lord Mohun and Lord Castlewood-having seen Mrs. <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> Bracegirdle act, and having supped at the.

Very pleasing contrasts of colour are obtained in this church by the use of simple materials,brick, chalk, alabaster, granite, and marble-and the effect is most delicate and harmonious.

     <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><p>Between the great room of the Society of Arts and that carpenter's shop, night after night, and morning after morning, for years, plodded James Barry. In the golden glow of the summer sunsets, and in the <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> thick darkness of winter nights, when the glow-worm oil-lamps, faintly glimmering here and there, scarcely served to show his way. Through hail and rain, heat and cold, mud and snow, the little shabby, pockmarked man went wearily homewards from   his daily work.   Now brooding over colossal figures of heathen divinities, over grace, light, and shade; now surlily growling curses upon the contemptible meanness which deprived him of both models and materials.

Patiently he proceeds to strike a shower of sparks over the tinder until it ignites, when, carefully puffing to keep it burning, he applies the pointed or brimstone end of the flat match to it, and presently contrives to light his old tin lamp. Then we see the painting-room, dimly but with sufficient clearness to note the <num value="2">two</num> old chairs, the deal table, the tapestry-like cobwebs, a huge painting on the clumsy easel, old straining frames, dirt-concealed sketches in chalk and oil, a copper-plate printing-press, and, on the walls, the <num value="6">six</num> sketches for his great paintings in the <placeName key="cruch,Adelphi">Adelphi</placeName>.</p></quote><bibl>---<hi rend="italics">The Builder</hi>, <dateStruct value="1875-09-25"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>.</bibl></cit></quote>

      <p>The district of <rs type="Subject">Soho</rs>, to the south of <placeName key="bart,Oxford Street">Oxford Street</placeName>, is chiefly due to the enterprise of a builder whose name is commemorated in <placeName key="bart,Frith Street">Frith Street</placeName>.

After the Duke of Monmouth's execution the <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> house was bought by Lord Bateman (commemorated in Bateman's Buildings), of whom Horace Walpole narrates that George I. made him an Irish peer to prevent having to make him a knight of the Bath, <quote>for,</quote> he said, <quote>I can make him   a lord, but I cannot make him a gentleman.</quote> Monmouth House was pulled down in <dateStruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></dateStruct>.</p>
   <p>On the east of the square, at the corner of <placeName key="cruch,Sutton street">Sutton Street</placeName>, was Carlisle House, the town house of the Earls of Carlisle, built in the time of James II. It became celebrated at the end of the last century for the masked balls and concerts of the extraordinary Mrs. Teresa Cornelys, at which, though they were far from immaculate, the fashionable world of the time loved to congregate.<note id="n.151.1">Mrs. Cornelys, afterwards reduced to sell asses' milk in <placeName key="bart,Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</placeName>, died in the <placeName key="cruch,Fleet prison">Fleet Prison</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct>.</note>     They were supplanted by Almack's, and the greater part of the house was pulled down in <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct>.

   <p>In the middle of the square stood till lately a much-injured statue, concerning which opinions differed as to whether it represented   Charles II. or the Duke of Monmouth.

   <p>The whole district of Soho, especially the southern portion of it, has now a French aspect, from the number of French refugees who have settled there at different times, especially the Huguenots after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in <dateStruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></dateStruct>, the &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9;s of the Reign of Terror in <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, and the Communists of <dateStruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></dateStruct>.

It is noteworthy that places dedicated to this saint, <quote>abbot and martyr,</quote> were almost always outside some great town. This was because St. Giles (St. Egidius) was the patron saint of lepers, and where a place was called by his name a lazar-house always existed.   From   the reign of Edward III. to that of Henry VIII. <quote>the pleasant village of St. Giles</quote> consisted of only a few cottages grouped around an old stone cross, with some shops whose owners' names are preserved in the hospital grants as Gervase le Lyngedrap (linendraper), and   Reginald   le Tailleur, &amp;c.   A   hospital for lepers was built here by Matilda, wife of Henry I., about <dateStruct value="1118--"><year reg="1118">1118</year></dateStruct>, being attached to a larger house of the kind at Burton Lazars in Leicestershire. It was in front of this hospital that the Lollard conspirators met under Sir John Oldcastle in <dateStruct value="1413--"><year reg="1413">1413</year></dateStruct>, and on the same spot he was roasted in chains over a slow fire.</p>

She was daughter of Alice Leigh, who married and was repudiated by Sir Robert Dudley (son of Elizabeth's Earl of Leicester), and was created Duchess of Dudley by Charles I., a title which was confirmed by Charles II. The words of her daughter's epitaph do not flatter her when they say that <quote>she lived and died worthy of that honour;</quote> she resided close by in that house of Lord Lisle which supplanted the old hospital, and is buried at Stoneleigh. <quote>Under ye pewes in ye south aisle of Saint Giles' church,</quote> says Aubrey, was buried, in <dateStruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></dateStruct>.

 Under the Tudors the character of <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName> was changed from a country village to that of <num value="1">one</num> of the poorest parishes in London. <quote>A cellar in <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName></quote> has long been an epithet to denote the lowest grade of poverty. In <dateStruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></dateStruct>, during the Great Plague, <num value="3216">3,216</num> persons died in <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName> alone. But the dense mass of houses called the <quote>Rookery,</quote> which was once the worst part of the parish, has been cleared away in the formation of <placeName key="bart,New Oxford Street">New Oxford Street</placeName>, and the condition of the whole neighbourhood is improving, though it still continues <num value="1">one</num> of the poorest in London. Much harm has been done by the ill-judged benevolence of writers of little religious books, and the exaggerated pictures they have drawn of the poverty of this district, resulting in unnecessarily large subscriptions, which destroy the habit of self-dependence amongst the inhabitants. There is seldom absolute destitution   except amongst those who, having <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> fallen from better days, have never been able to acquire the habit of work. Old-clothes-men, bird-fanciers, bird-cage makers, and   ballad-mongers drive   the most flourishing trades. Apropos of the latter, Walford's <title>Old and New London</title> gives an amusing account of the origin of the expression <quote>Catchpenny,</quote> in the displeasure of the people at being taken in by the ingenuity of James Catnach, a popular ballad printer in Monmouth Court, who, after the murder of Weare by Thurtell, obtained a great sale for a broadside, which he headed, <quote>WE ARE ALIVE AGAIN,</quote> which the public read as WEARE.

His <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> sermons were but so many variations on <num value="2">two</num> key-notes.

On the right of the entrance of the room is a model of the principal temple at Xanthus, to which most of the sculptures in this room   (No. <num value="34">34</num>-<num value="140">140</num>) belong, and where they are marked at the appropriate points in the model.   <num value="3">Three</num> tombs from   Xanthus, or portions of them, are likewise preserved here.</p>

She is chiefly celebrated, however, for her violent grief for the loss of her husband (who was also her brother), whose ashes she mixed daily with her drink, of whom she <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> induced the most eminent Greek rhetoricians to proclaim the praises, and for whose loss she died in <num value="2">two</num> years of a broken heart, having erected to his memory a mausoleum which surpassed in splendour all the monuments of the ancient world. It was an edifice like an Ionic temple, raised on a lofty basement, and surmounted by a pyramid, with a chariot group on the summit. The whole was of Parian marble. Its architects were Satyros and Pythios. <num value="4">Four</num> great sculptors-Scopas, Leochares, Bryaxis, and Timotheos--were employed on its decorations; a <num value="5">fifth</num>, probably Pythios, made the crowning chariot group. From its beauty the name of mausoleum came to be applied to all similar monuments. The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus is mentioned by Vitruvius, Pliny, and Lucian, and is alluded to as a still-existing wonder by Eustathius, who wrote in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century. After this it ceased to excite attention till, in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, <num value="13">thirteen</num> sculptured slabs were sent to England by Lord <placeName key="cruch,Stratford">Stratford</placeName> de Redcliffe from the Castle of Budrum, which had been built by the Knights of St. John in the ruins of Halicarnassus.

Newton, Keeper of the Greek and Roman antiquities of the <placeName key="cruch,British Museum">British Museum</placeName>, visited Budrum, and his discovery of the colossal lions inserted in the walls of the castle and other evident remains of the Mausoleum led the Government, in <dateStruct value="1856-11--"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, to send out the steam corvette <hi rend="italics">Gorgon</hi>, with workmen, and a firman permitting them to excavate.</p>
   <p>The most remarkable of the remains brought over are the Lions, guardians of the tomb, with the expression varied in each; and the colossal statue believed to represent the despotic and unscrupulous satrap Mausolus himself (<dateStruct value="-377"><year reg="-377">B.C. 377</year></dateStruct>-<num value="353">353</num>), which was found broken into <num value="65">sixty-five</num> <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> fragments, but is now nearly complete, wanting only the arms and <num value="1">one</num> foot.</p>
   <p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>The aspect of the figure accords well with the description which  Mausolus is made to give of himself in Lucan's Dialogue.  <quote> I was,</quote>  he says, addressing Diogenes,  <quote>a tall, handsome man, and formidable in war.</quote>  </quote><bibl>-C.

   <p>The <hi rend="italics">Elgin   Room</hi>   is almost entirely   devoted   to   the precious marbles removed by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon in <dateStruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></dateStruct>, lost by shipwreck, recovered by divers, and purchased by Government, after long controversy, in <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct>.  It is almost forgotten   now   with what vituperation the marbles were assailed   on their arrival in England--they were <quote>not originals,</quote> they were <quote>of the time of Hadrian,</quote> they were the <quote>works of journeymen, not deserving the name of artists,</quote> they were <quote>too much broken to be of any value.</quote> The sum   paid to Lord Elgin was less than he had expended upon the marbles, and far less than Napoleon was willing to pay for them.   Yet now   they are <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> recognised as the greatest masterpieces of Greek art in this or any other country.   A   model of the Parthenon (the Temple of Athene) here shows their original position. Around the room are the glorious frieze and metopes of the temple (their subjects are described beneath): we must remember that here they are, as it were, turned inside out. The frieze represents the procession which took place every <num value="5">five</num> years in honour of the goddess. The south side is the least perfect, having been injured by the winds from the sea: it is chiefly occupied by the victims, who made this procession a kind of cattle-show, as each of the Athenian colonies contributed, and, by their anxiety to shine in this, Athens knew the disposition of her colonies. Here also we see the maidens carrying the sacrificial vessels, the flat vessels being used for libations.   To meet this procession comes from the north side a long cavalcade of chariots and horsemen, many of the latter most glorious. From the east end of the temple, where the processions united, are representations of the gods, without whose presence no Greek festival was considered complete, and of the delivery of the <hi rend="italics">peplos</hi>, the embroidered veil of Athene, given every <num value="5">five</num> years.
    <quote rend="blockquote"><p>The Temple of Minerva in the Acropolis of Athens, erected by  Ictinus and Callicrates, was under the direction of Phidias, and to him we probably owe the composition, style, and character of the sculpture, in addition to much assistance in drawing, modelling, choice of the naked, and draperies, as well as occasional execution of parts in the marble.</p>
    <p> The emulators of Phidias were Alcamenes, Critias, Nestocles, and  Hegias; <num value="20">twenty</num> years after, Agelades, Gallon, Polycletus, Phragmon,  Gorgias, Lacon, Myron, Scopas, Pythagoras, and Perelius.</p>
<p><gap/>
</p>
    <p>It is the peculiar character and praise of Phidias's style that ho represented gods better than men. As this sculptor determined the <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> visible idea of Jupiter, his successors employed a <num value="100">hundred</num> years on the forms of the inferior divinities.

   <p><cit><quote>We possess in England the most precious examples of Grecian power in the sculpture of animals. The horses of the frieze in the Elgin Collection appear to live and move, to roll their eyes, to gallop, prance, and curvet; the veins of their faces and legs seem distended with circulation; in them are distinguished the hardness and decision of bony forms, from the elasticity of tendon and the softness of flesh. The beholder is charmed with the deer-like lightness and elegance of their make, and although the relief is not above an inch from the background, and they are so much smaller than nature, we can scarcely suffer reason to persuade us they are not alive.</quote><bibl>-Flaxman. <title>Lectures on Sculpture.</title></bibl></cit></p></quote>

   <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>It is the union of nature with ideal beauty, the probabilities and accidents of bone, flesh, and tendon, from extension, flexion, compression, gravitation, action, or repose, that rank at once the Elgin Marbles above all other works of art in the world.

Every truth of shape, the result of the inherent organization of man as an intellectual being; every variation of that shape, produced by the slightest variation of motion, in consequence of the slightest variation of intention, acting on it; every result of repose on flesh as a soft substance, and on bone as a hard-both being influenced by the common principles of life and gravitation; every harmony of line in composition, from geometrical principle,--all proving the science of the artist; every beauty of conception proving his genius; and every grace of execution proving that practice has given his hand power, can be shown to exist in the Elgin Marbles....

    <p>On the left of the room are the sculptures from the eastern pediment of the temple, at which they occupied platforms at the <num value="2">two</num> ends, a much larger space in the middle than is seen here having been filled by figures which are lost. The subject of the whole is the Birth of Athene from the brain of Zeus. The father of the gods complaining <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> of a violent pain in his head, Hephaestus split it open with his axe, when Athene sprang forth in full armour. The central figures are wanting: those of which we see the remnants represent the gods and goddesses who were present at the event, which is supposed to have taken place on Olympus.   At the south end of the pediment the horses of Helios, or the Sun, are rising from   the waves. at the north end Selene, or Night, is going down. Of the intermediate figures only <num value="1">one</num> in rapid movement can, with some probability, be identified as Iris, the messenger of the gods, going to announce the event.   The noble male figure reclining on a rock covered with a lion's skin (No. <num value="7">7</num>) has generally, but without reason, been called Theseus.</p>

    <p>On the right are the remains of the western pediment, of which   the missing   portions are better known than those of the eastern pediment, owing to the existence of drawings taken in <dateStruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></dateStruct>.

   <p>Another record of the fertility of the Ely Place garden will be found in the fact that when, to please Elizabeth, Bishop Cox leased the gatehouse and garden to her favourite, Sir Christopher Hatton, for a quit-rent of a red rose, <num value="10">ten</num> loads of hay, and <measure key="10l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="10">10</num></measure> yearly, he retained the right not only of walking in the gardens, but of gathering <num value="20">twenty</num> bushels of roses yearly!   Sir Christopher Hatton expended a large sum   upon Ely Place, and petitioned Elizabeth to alienate to him the whole of the house and gardens. She immediately desired Bishop Cox to do so, but he refused, saying that <quote>in his conscience he could not do it, being a piece of sacrilege;</quote> that he was intrusted with the property of the see <quote>to be a steward, and not a scatterer.</quote> The Bishop was, however, eventually obliged to consent to the alienation of the property to Sir Christopher till all the money he had expended upon Ely Place should be repaid by the see. It was when the Queen found his successor, Dr. Martin Heton, unwilling to fulfil these terms, that she addressed to him her characteristic note-</p>

The money which Sir Christopher had expended upon Ely <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> Place was borrowed from the Queen, and it was her demanding a settlement of their accounts which caused his death. <quote>It broke his heart,</quote> says Fuller, <quote>that the queen, which seldom gave loans, and never forgave due debts, rigorously demanded the payment of some arrears which Sir Christopher did not hope to have remitted, and did only desire to have forborne: failing herein in his expectation, it went to his heart, and cast him into a mortal disease. The queen afterwards did endeavour what she could to recover him, bringing, as some say, cordial broths unto him with her own hands; but all would not do. There's no pulley can draw up a heart once cast down, though a queen herself should set her hand thereunto.</quote> Sir Christopher died in Ely House, <dateStruct value="1591-09-20"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1591">1591</year></dateStruct>.

   <p>The only remaining fragment of old Ely House is the chapel, dedicated to <hi rend="italics">St. Ethdedreda</hi> (<num value="630">630</num>), daughter of Anna, King of the West Angles, and wife of Egfrid, King of Northumberland, whose society she forsook to become Abbess of Ely and foundress of its cathedral. She was best known after death by the popular name of St. Awdry. A fair was held in her honour, at which a particular kind of beads was sold called St. Awdry or Tawdry beads. Gradually these grew to be of the shabbiest and cheapest description, and became a by-word for anything shabby or flimsy-whence our familiar word <quote>tawdry</quote> commemorates St. Etheldreda. The chapel, long given up to the Welsh residents in London, is now in the hands of Roman Catholics, who have treated it with the utmost regard for its ancient characteristics. The walls of the ancient crypt are left with their rugged stonework unaltered. The ceiling is not vaulted, and the roof is formed by the chapel floor, but some stone pillars have been supplied in the place of the solid chestnut posts by which it was once sustained.

    <p>The different accounts of Charles I.'s execution introduce us to   several names of the rooms in   the   old palace. We are able to follow him through the whole of the last scenes of the <dateStruct value="1648-01-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1648">1648</year></dateStruct>.     When he arrived, having walked from St. James's, <quote>the King went up <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> the stairs leading to the Long Gallery</quote> of Henry VIII., and so to the west side of the palace.   In the <quote>Horn Chamber</quote> he was given up to the officers who held the warrant for his execution. Then he passed on to the <quote>Cabinet Chamber,</quote> looking upon Privy Garden. Here, the scaffold not being ready, he prayed and conversed with Bishop Juxon, ate some bread, and drank some claret. Several of the Puritan clergy knocked at the door and offered to pray with him, but he said that they had prayed <hi rend="italics">against</hi> him too often for him to wish to pray with them in his last moments. Meanwhile, in a small distant room, Cromwell was signing the order to the executioner, and workmen were employed in breaking a passage through the west wall of the Banqueting House, that the warrant for the execution might be carried out which ordained it to be held <quote>in the open street before <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>.</quote></p>
   <p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>The reason for breaking through the wall is obvious. Had Charles passed through <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend="italics">lower</hi> windows, the scaffold must necessarily have been so low that it would have been on a level with the heads of the people, a circumstance, for many evident reasons, to be carefully avoided; while, on the other hand, had he passed through <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend="italics">upper</hi> windows, the height would have been so great that no <num value="1">one</num> could have witnessed the scene except those who were immediately on the scaffold.</quote><bibl>-Jesse.

   <p>When Colonel Hacker knocked   at the door of the <quote>Cabinet Chamber,</quote> the king stretched out his hands to Bishop Juxon and his faithful attendant Herbert, which they kissed, falling upon their knees and weeping. The king himself assisted the old bishop to rise. Then, says Herbert, <quote>the king was led along all the galleries and Banqueting House, and there was a passage broken through the wall, by which the king passed to the scaffold.</quote> Below, <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> in the court between the <num value="2">two</num> gates, through which passed the highway to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, were vast crowds of spectators, while others stood upon the opposite roofs; amongst whom   the aged Archbishop Usher was led up to have a last sight of his royal master, but fainted when he beheld him. The regiments of foot and horse drawn up around the scaffold prevented the people from hearing the final words of the king, which were consequently addressed to those immediately around him. He declared his innocence of the crimes laid to his charge, and prayed to God with St. Stephen for forgiveness to his murderers. He said to the Bishop; <quote>I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown, where no disturbance can be, no disturbance in the world,</quote> and gave.him his George, with the single word <quote>Remember.</quote> Then, after praying awhile, he laid his neck upon the block, and when he made the sign which was agreed upon, by stretching out his hands, the executioner at <num value="1">one</num> blow severed his head from his body, and held it up, saying, <quote>Behold the head of a traitor.</quote> But <quote>a universal groan was uttered by the people (as if by <num value="1">one</num> consent), such as never was heard before.</quote> <note id="n.211.1">Ellis's <title>Letters</title>, vol. iii. <num value="333">333</num>.</note>

   <p>Almost from the time of Charles's execution Cromwell occupied rooms in the Cockpit, where the Treasury is now, but soon after he was installed <quote>Lord Protector of the Commonwealth</quote> (<dateStruct value="1653-12-16"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg="16">16</day>, <year reg="1653">1653</year></dateStruct>), he took up his abode in the royal apartments, with his <quote>Lady Protectress</quote> and his family. Cromwell's puritanical tastes did not make him averse to the luxury he found there, and, when Evelyn visited <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> after a long interval in <dateStruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></dateStruct>, he found it <quote>very glorious and well furnished.</quote> But the Protectress <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> could not give up her habits of nimble housewifery, and <quote>employed a surveyor to make her some little labyrinths and trap-stairs, by which she might, at all times, unseen, pass to and fro, and come unawares upon her servants, and keep them vigilant in their places and honest in the discharge thereof.</quote> <note id="n.212.1">The Court and Kitchen of Elizabeth Cromwell, <dateStruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></dateStruct>.</note>   With   Cromwell in   <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> lived Milton, as his Latin   Secretary.

    <p>In the words of Hume, Cromwell upon his death-bed <quote>assumed more the character of a mediator, interceding for his people, than that of a criminal, whose atrocious violation of social duty had, from every tribunal, human and divine, merited the severest vengeance.</quote> Having inquired of  Godwin, the divine who attended him, whether a person who had once been in a state of grace could afterwards be damned, and being assured it was impossible, he said, <quote>Then I am safe, for I am sure that I was once in a state of grace.</quote></p>

The vast labyrinthine chambers of the palace were soon filled to overflowing by his crowded court. The queen's rooms were facing the river to the east of the Water Gate. Prince Rupert had rooms in the Stone Gallery, which ran along the south side of <placeName key="cruch,Privy gardens">Privy Gardens</placeName>, beyond the main buildings of the palace, and beneath him were the apartments of the king's mistresses, Barbara   Palmer, Countess of Castlemaine, afterwards Duchess .of Cleveland, and Louise de Querouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. The rooms of the latter, who <num value="1">first</num> came to England with Henrietta, Duchess of Orleans, to entice Charles .II. into an alliance with Louis XIV., and whose <quote>childish, simple, baby-face</quote> is described by Evelyn, were <num value="3">three</num> times rebuilt to please her, having <quote><num value="10">ten</num> times the richness and glory</quote> of the queen's.<note id="n.213.1">Evelyn.</note> Nell Gwynne did not live in the palace, though she was <num value="1">one</num> of Queen Catherine's Maids of Honour! At times, when the river was at high tide, the water would flood the apartments of these ladies. Thus it happened in the kitchen of Lady Castlemaine when the king was coming to sup with her. The cook came to tell her that the chine of beef could not be roasted, for the water had put the fire out. <quote>Zounds,</quote> replied the lady, <quote>you may burn the palace down, but the beef must be roasted,</quote> so <quote>it was carried to Mrs. Sarah's husband's, and there roasted.</quote> <note id="n.213.2"> Pepys.</note> Just before Queen Catherine of Braganza's arrival the king requested the Lords and Commons <quote>to put that compliment upon her that she might not find <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> surrounded by water.</quote></p>

   <p>It was from <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> that Queen Mary Beatrice made her escape on the night of <dateStruct value="1688-12-9"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg="9">9</day>, <year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct>. The adventure was confided to the Count de Lauzun and his friend M. de St. Victor:   gentleman of Avignon. The queen on that terrible evening vainly entreated to be allowed to remain and share the perils of her husband; he assured her that it was absolutely necessary that she should precede him, and that he would follow her in <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours. The king and queen went to bed as usual to avoid suspicion, but rose soon after, when the queen put on a disguise provided by St. Victor. The royal pair then descended to the rooms of Madame de Labadie, where they found Lauzun, with the infant Prince James and his <num value="2">two</num> nurses. The king, turning to Lauzun, said, <quote>I confide my queen and my son to your care: all must be hazarded to convey them with the utmost speed to France.</quote> Lauzun then gave his hand to the queen to lead her away, and, followed by the <num value="2">two</num> nurses with the child, they crossed the Great Gallery, and descended by a back staircase and a postern gate to <placeName key="cruch,Privy gardens">Privy Gardens</placeName>.

   <p>On the   <num value="11">11th</num> the Dutch troops had entered London, and James, having commanded the gallant Lord Craven, who was prepared to defend the palace to the utmost, to draw   off the guard which   he commanded, escaped himself in a boat from the water-entrance of the palace at <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the morning. At Feversham his flight was arrested, and he returned amid bonfires, bell-ringing, and every symptom   of joy from   the fickle populace.

The Stone Gallery and the late apartments of the royal mistresses in <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> were burnt down in <dateStruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></dateStruct>, and the whole edifice was almost totally destroyed by fire through the negligence of a Dutch maidservant in <dateStruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></dateStruct>.
    </p><p>The principal remaining fragment of the palace is the
 <hi rend="italics">Banqueting House</hi> of Inigo Jones, from which Charles I. passed to execution. Built in the dawn of the style of  Wren, it is <num value="1">one</num> of the most grandiose examples of that style, and is perfect alike in symmetry and proportion.  That it has no entrance apparent at <num value="1">first</num> sight is due to the fact that it was only intended as a portion of a larger building. In the same way we must remember that the appearance of <num value="2">two</num> stories externally, while the whole is <num value="1">one</num> room, is due to the Banqueting House being only <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="4">four</num> intended blocks, of which <num value="1">one</num> was to be a chapel surrounded by galleries, and the other <num value="2">two</num> divided into <num value="2">two</num> tiers of apartments. The Banqueting House was turned into a chapel by George I., but has never been consecrated, and the aspect of a hall is retained by the ugly false red curtains which surround the interior of the building. It is called the <rs type="subject">>Chapel Royal of <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName></rs>, is served by the chaplains of the sovereign, and is <num value="1">one</num> of the dreariest places of worship in London. The ceiling is still decorated with canvas pictures by Rubens (<dateStruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></dateStruct>) representing the apotheosis of James I. The painter received <measure key="3000l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> for <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> these works.

   </p><p>To this chapel the <num value="7">Seven</num> Bishops came to return thanks immediately after their acquittal. It was <placeName key="cruch,St. Peter's church">St. Peter's</placeName> Day, and it was remarked that the Epistle was singularly appropriate, being part of the <num value="12">12th</num> chapter of the Acts, recording Peter's miraculous deliverance from prison.<note id="n.218.2">D'Oyley's <quote><title>Life of Archbishop Sancroft.</title></quote> </note> Archbishop Tillotson (<dateStruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></dateStruct>) was seized with paralysis here during Divine service on Sunday.<note id="n.218.3">Archbishop Whitgift had been similarly attacked with a fatal paralytic  seizure at <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>.</note> <quote>He felt it coming on him, but not thinking it decent to interrupt the Divine service, he neglected it too long.</quote> His death immediately preceded that of Queen Mary, who was greatly attached to him.
   </p><p>The <hi rend="italics">Weathercock</hi> on the north end of the Banqueting House is of historic interest, as having been placed there by James II., that he might watch from his chamber whether it was a wind which would bring the Dutch fleet to England.

    </p><p>The exterior of the Banqueting House has always been much studied by architects.

<p>The <num value="1">first</num> church on this site was built on the Isle of Thorns-- <quote>Thorney Island</quote> --an almost insulated peninsula of dry sand and gravel, girt on <num value="1">one</num> side by the Thames, and on the other by the marshes formed by the little stream Eye,<note id="n.228.1">The Eye, now a sewer, still passes under <placeName key="bart,New Bond Street">New Bond Street</placeName>, the <placeName key="cruch,Green park">Green Park</placeName>, and Buckingham Palace, to join the Thames near <placeName key="bart,Vauxhall Bridge">Vauxhall Bridge</placeName>,</note> which gave its name to Tyburn, before it fell into the river.   Here Sebert, King of the East Saxons, who died in <num value="616">616</num>, having been baptized by Mellitus, is said to have founded a church, which he dedicated to St. Peter, either from an association with the great church in Rome, from   which Augustine had lately come, or to balance his rival foundation in honour of St. Paul upon a neighbouring hill.   Sulcard, the <num value="1">first</num> historian of the Abbey, relates that on a Sunday night, being the eve of the day on which the church was to be consecrated by Bishop Mellitus, Edric the fisherman was watching his nets by the bank of the island. On the opposite shore he saw a gleaming light, and, when he approached it in his boat, he found a venerable man, who desired to be ferried across the stream. Upon their arrival at the island, the <pb id="p.229" n="229"/> mysterious stranger landed, and proceeded to the church, calling up on his way <num value="2">two</num> springs of water, which still exist, by <num value="2">two</num> blows of his staff. Then a host of angels miraculously appeared, and held candles which lighted him as he went through all the usual forms of a church consecration, while throughout the service other angels were seen ascending and descending over the church, as in Jacob's vision. When the old man returned to the boat, he bade Edric tell Mellitus that the church was already consecrated by St. Peter, who held the keys of heaven, and promised that a plentiful supply of fish would never fail him as a fisherman if he ceased to work on a Sunday, and did not forget to bear a tithe of that which he caught to the Abbey of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.
    </p><p>On the following day, when Mellitus came to consecrate the church, Edric presented himself and told his story, showing, in proof of it, the marks of consecration in the traces of the chrism, the crosses on the doors, and the droppings of the angelic candles. The bishop acknowledged that his work had been already done by saintly hands, and changed the name of the place from Thorney to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and in recollection of the story of Edric a tithe of fish was paid by the Thames fishermen to the Abbey till  <dateStruct value="1382"><year reg="1382">1382</year></dateStruct>,<note id="n.229.1">In <dateStruct value="1231--"><year reg="1231">1231</year></dateStruct> the monks of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> went to law with the vicar of <placeName key="cruch,Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</placeName> for the tithe of salmon caught in his parish, protesting that it had been granted by St. Peter to their Abbey at its consecration.-<hi rend="italics">Flete</hi>.</note> the bearer having a right to sit that day at the prior's table, and to ask for bread and ale from the cellarman.
   </p><p>Beside the church of Sebert arose the palace of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, to which it served as a chapel, as <pb id="p.230" n="230"/> <placeName key="cruch,St. George's church">St. George's</placeName> does to Windsor. It is connected with many of the legends of that picturesque age. Here, while he was attending mass with Leofric of Mercia and his wife, the famous Godiva, Edward the Confessor announced that he saw the Saviour appear as a luminous child. By the wayside between the palace and the chapel sate Michael, the crippled Irishman, who assured Hugolin, the chamberlain, that St. Peter had promised his cure if the king would himself bear him   on his shoulders to the church, upon which Edward bore him to the altar, where he was received by Godric, the sacristan, and walked away whole.
   </p><p>Whilst he was an exile Edward had vowed that if he returned to England in safety he would make a pilgrimage to Rome. This promise, after his coronation, he was most anxious to perform, but his nobles refused to let him go, and the pope (Leo IX.) released him from his vow, on condition of his founding or restoring a church in honour of St. Peter. Then, to an ancient hermit near Worcester, St. Peter appeared, <quote>bright and beautiful, like to a clerk,</quote> and bade him tell the king that the church to which he must devote himself, and where he must establish a Benedictine monastery, was no other than the ancient minster of Thorney, which he knew so well.
   </p><p>Edward, henceforth devoting a <num value="10">tenth</num> of his whole substance to the work, destroyed the old church, and rebuilt it from the foundation, as the <quote>Collegiate Church of St. Peter at <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</quote> It was the <num value="1">first</num> cruciform church erected in England,<note id="n.230.1"><quote lang="LA">Novo compositionis genere.</quote>--<hi rend="italics">Matthew Paris.</hi></note> and was of immense size for the age, covering the whole of the ground occupied by the present building.   The foundation was laid in <dateStruct value="1049--"><year reg="1049">1049</year></dateStruct>, and the <pb id="p.231" n="231"/> church was consecrated <dateStruct value="1065-12-28"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="28">28</day>, <year reg="1065">1065</year></dateStruct>, <num value="8">eight</num> days before the death of the king.   Of this church and monastery of the Confessor nothing remains now but the Chapel of the Pyx, the lower part of the Refectory underlying the <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> schoolroom, part of the Dormitory, and the whole of the lower walls of the South Cloister; but the Bayeux tapestry still shows us in outline the church of the Confessor as it existed in its glory.
   </p><p>The <num value="2">second</num> founder of the Abbey was Henry III., who pulled down most of the Confessor's work, and from <dateStruct value="1245--"><year reg="1245">1245</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1272--"><year reg="1272">1272</year></dateStruct> devoted himself to rebuilding. The material he employed was <num value="1">first</num> the green sandstone, which has given the name of God-stone to the place in Surrey whence it came, and afterwards Caen stone.   The portions which remain to us from his time are the Confessor's Chapel, the side aisles and their chapels, and the choir and transepts.  The work of Henry was continued by his son Edward I., who built the eastern portion of the nave, and it was carried on by different abbots till the great west window was erected by Abbot Estney in <dateStruct value="1498--"><year reg="1498">1498</year></dateStruct>. Meantime, Abbot Littlington, in <dateStruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></dateStruct>, had added the College Hall, the Abbot's House,  Jerusalem Chamber, and part of the cloisters.   In <dateStruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></dateStruct>  Henry VII. pulled down the Lady Chapel, and built his beautiful Perpendicular chapel instead.   The western towers were only completed from designs of Sir Christopher  Wren (<dateStruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></dateStruct>), under whom   much of the   exterior was refaced with Oxfordshire stone, and its original details mercilessly defaced and pared down.

But no knowledge of architecture is needed for the enjoyment of the colouring--of the radiant hues of the stained-glass, which enhances the depth of the shadows amid the time-stained arches, and floods the roof and its beautiful tracery with light. <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

The common allegorical materials of other monuments are here.   Even History is inscribing a conceit-she has written John, Duke of Argyle and Gr--there she pauses and weeps.

    </p><p>It is said that on looking back from the portico of Henry  VII.'s Chapel, every phase of Gothic architecture, from  Henry III. to Henry VII., may be seen.   The glorious brass gates are adorned with all the badges of the founder--the fleur-de-lis, the portcullis and crown, the falcon and fetterlock, the thistle and crown, the united roses of York and Lancaster entwined with the crown, the initials R. H., the royal crown, and the <num value="3">three</num> lions of England.. The devices of Henry VII. are also borne by the angels sculptured on the frieze at the west end of the chapel. The windows have traces of the white roses of Lancaster and of the fleur-de-lis and H's with which they were once filled; from the end window the figure of Henry VII. looks down upon the whole.   <num value="73">Seventy-three</num> statues, whose <quote>natural simplicity and grandeur of character and drapery</quote> are greatly commended by Flaxman, surround the walls.
   </p><p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote> The very walls are wrought into universal ornament, encrusted with tracery, and scooped into niches, crowded with statues of saints and martyrs.

   </p><p>The stalls of the Knights of the Bath surround the chapel, with the seats for the esquires in front. The end stall on the right is decorated with a figure of Henry VII. The sculptures on the misereres are exceedingly quaint, chiefly monkish satires on the evil lives of their brethren. Amongst them are combats between monks and nuns, a monk seized <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> and a monk carried off by the devil, <num value="1">one</num> boy whipping another, apes gathering nuts, and a fox in armour riding a goose. The best is the Judgment of Solomon; the cause of the contention--the substitution of the dead for the living child--is represented with ludicrous simplicity, repeated on either side of the bracket.

Thus he was seen when his coffin was opened by Henry I. in the presence of Bishop Gundulf, who tried to steal a hair from his white beard. Thus he was again seen by Henry II., in whose reign he was transferred by Archbishop Becket to a new and <quote>precious feretry,</quote> just after his canonization (<dateStruct value="1161-02-7"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg="7">7</day>, <year reg="1161">1161</year></dateStruct>) by Pope Alexander III., who enjoined <quote>that his body be honoured here on earth, as his soul is glorified in heaven.</quote> Henry III. also looked upon the <quote>incorrupt</quote> body, before its translation to its present resting-place, on the shoulders of the royal Plantagenet princes, whose own sepulchres were afterwards to gather around it. The body lies in a stone coffin, iron-bound, within the shrine of marble and mosaic. It appears from <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> an illumination in the <title>Life of St. Edward</title> in the University Library at Cambridge that, after his canonization, <num value="1">one</num> end of the shrine was for some time left open, that sick persons might creep through and touch the coffin. The <num value="7">seven</num> recesses at the sides of the shrine were intended for pilgrims to kneel under. The inlaid wooden wainscoting on the top was added by Abbot Feckenham in the reign of Mary I., by whom the shrine was restored, for it had been partially, if not wholly, displaced at the Dissolution. Before that it probably had a Gothic canopy. At the coronation of James II. both shrine and coffin were broken by the fall of some scaffolding. It was then robbed for the last time. Henry Keepe, who wrote the <title>Monumenta Westmonasteriensia,</title> relates that he himself put in his hand and drew forth the chain and crucifix of the Confessor, which were accepted by the last of the Stuart kings. The shrine, which was <num value="1">one</num> of the most popular points of pilgrimage before the Reformation, is still the object of pilgrimages with Roman Catholics.

She had been accustomed frequently to. pass days and nights together; kneeling, bare-footed and dressed in haircloth, before her uncle's shrine, and had herself the reputation of a saint. She was <quote>the very mirror of piety, humility, and princely bounty,</quote> says Florence of <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> Worcester.   <quote>Her virtues were so great,</quote> say the <title>Annals of Waverley,</title> that <quote>an entire day would not suffice to recount them.</quote>   Before the shrine, as Pennant says, the <foreign lang="LA">spolia opima</foreign> were offered, the Scottish regalia, and the sacred stone from Scone; and here the little Alphonso, son of Edward I., offered the golden coronet of Llewelyn, Prince of Wales.<note id="n.291.1">Gough. <title>Sepulchral Effgies,</title> i.

<p>We now enter the <hi rend="italics">North Transept</hi> of the Abbey, of which the great feature is the beautiful rose-window (restored <dateStruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></dateStruct>), <num value="32">thirty-two</num> feet in diameter. This transept was utterly uninvaded by monuments till the Duke of Newcastle was buried here <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago. Since then it has become the favourite burial-place of admirals, and since Pitt, Earl of Chatham, was laid here in <dateStruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></dateStruct>, the central aisle has been
<quote>appropriated to statesmen, as the other transept by poets.</quote>
The whole character of the monuments is now changed; while the earlier tombs are intended to recall <hi rend="italics">Death</hi> to the mind, the memorials of the last <num value="2">two</num> centuries are entirely devoted to the exaltation of the <hi rend="italics">Life</hi> of the person commemorated.   In this transept, especially, the entire space between the grey arches is filled by huge monuments groaning under pagan sculpture of offensive enormity, emulating the tombs of the Popes in <placeName key="cruch,St. Peter's church">St. Peter's</placeName> in their size, and curious as proving how taste is changed by showing the popularity which such sculptors as Nollekens, Scheemakers, and Bacon long enjoyed in England. Through the remainder of the Abbey the monuments, often interesting from their associations, are in themselves chiefly remarkable <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> for their utter want of originality and variety. Justice and Temperance, Prudence and   Mercy, are for ever busy propping up the tremendous masses of masonry upon which Britannia, Fame, and Victory are perpetually seen crowning a bust, an urn, or a rostral column with their wreaths; while beneath these piles sit figures indicative of the military or naval professions of the deceased, plunged in idiotic despair. As we continue our walk through the church we descend gradually but surely, after we leave the fine conceptions and graphic portraiture of Roubiliac and Rysbrack. Even Bacon and Flaxman are weighed down by the pagan mania for Neptunes, Britannias, and Victorys, and only rise to anything like nobility in the single figures of Chatham   and Mansfield.   The abundant works of Chantrey and Westmacott in the Abbey are, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, monotonous and commonplace. But it is only when utterly wearied by the platitudes of Nollekens or Cheere,<note id="n.322.1">It would scarcely be believed from his works that Cheere was the master of Roubiliac.</note> that we appreciate what lower depths of degradation sculpture has reached in the once admired works of Taylor and Nathaniel Read and in most of the works of Bird.

The inscription, which is also by Bacon, drew forth the injunction of George III., who, while approving it, said, <quote>Now, Bacon, mind you do not turn author, stick to your chisel.</quote> When Bacon was retouching the statue of Chatham, a divine, and a stranger, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, in allusion to the story of Zeuxis, <quote>Take care what you are doing, you work for eternity.</quote>   This reverend person then stept into the pulpit and began to preach.

   </p><p>In <dateStruct value="1378--"><year reg="1378">1378</year></dateStruct> this choir was the scene of a crime which recalls the murder of Becket in Canterbury Cathedral.   <num value="2">Two</num> knights, Schakell and Hawle, who fought with the Black Prince in Spain, had taken prisoner a Spanish Count, whom they compelled to the duties of a valet. The delivery of this prisoner was demanded by John of Gaunt, who claimed the crown of Castile in right of his wife. The knights refused, and fled into sanctuary. Thither Sir Alan Buxhall, Constable of the Tower, and Sir Ralph Ferrars, with <num value="50">fifty</num> armed men, pursued them. For greater safety the knights fled into the very choir itself, where high-mass was being celebrated; but as the deacon reached the words in the gospel of the day, <quote>If the good man of the house had known what time the thief would appear,</quote> their assailants burst in. Schakell escaped, but Hawle fled round and round the choir, pursued by his enemies, and at length fell covered with wounds at the foot of the Prior's Stall: his servant and <num value="1">one</num> of the monks were slain with him. This flagrant violation of sanctuary occasioned unspeakable horror. The culprits were excommunicated and heavily fined, the desecrated Abbey was closed for <num value="4">four</num> months, and Parliament was not permitted to sit within the polluted precincts. <pb id="p.346" n="346"/>
   </p><p>A door at the eastern angle of Poets' Corner is the approach to the noble <hi rend="italics">Crypt</hi> under the Chapter House.

   </p><p>Here the monks, at least once a week, assembled to hold their chapters, in which all the affairs of the monastery were discussed. The abbot and the <num value="4">four</num> chief officers took their seats in the ornamented stalls opposite the entrance, the monks on the stone benches round. In front of the stalls criminals were tried, and, if found guilty, were publicly flogged against the central pillar of Purbeck marble (<num value="35">35</num> ft. high), which was used as a whipping-post.
   </p><p>But the monks had not sole possession of the Chapter House, for, as early as <dateStruct value="1282"><year reg="1282">1282</year></dateStruct>, when the Houses of Lords and Commons were separated, the <placeName key="cruch,House of commons">House of Commons</placeName> began to hold its sittings here, and for <num value="300">three hundred</num> years it continued to hold them, sometimes in the Refectory, but generally in the Chapter House.

Some arches of this period may be seen in the wall of a little court, entered by a door in the south wall: the door on the other side led to the abbey kitchen.

   </p><p>High up, across the middle of the Schoolroom, an iron bar divides the Upper and Lower Schools.   Over this bar, by an ancient custom, the college cook or her deputy tosses a stiffly-made Pancake on Shrove Tuesday.   The boys, on the other side of the bar, struggle to catch it, and if any boy can not only catch it but convey it away intact from all competitors to the head-master's house (a difficult feat) he can claim a guinea. In former days a curtain, hanging from this bar, separated the schools.
   <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><p>Every <num value="1">one</num>, who is acquainted with Westminster-school, knows that there is a curtain which used to be drawn across the room, to separate the upper school from the lower. A youth (Wake, father of Archbishop Wake) happened, by some mischance, to tear the above-mentioned curtain. The severity of the master (Dr. Busby) was too well known for the criminal to expect any pardon for such a fault; so that <pb id="p.366" n="366"/> the boy, who was of a meek temper, was terrified to death at the thoughts of his appearance, when his friend who sate next to him bade him be of good cheer, for that he would take the fault on himself.

It happened to be his friend's lot at that time to go the western circuit. The trial of the rebels, as they were then called, was very short, and nothing now remained but to pass sentence on them; when the judge hearing the name of his old friend, and observing his face more attentively, asked him if he was not formerly a <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> scholar? By the answer, he was soon convinced that it was his former generous friend; and without saying anything more at that time, made the best of his way to London, where employing all his power and interest with the protector, he saved his friend from the fate of his unhappy associates.</p></quote><bibl>--<hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. <num value="313">313</num>.</bibl></cit></quote>

 fled hither to sanctuary from Cardinal Wolsey in the time of Henry VIII., and remained here till his death, not all the Cardinal's influence having power to dislodge him.

(<dateStruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></dateStruct>), when they were finally abolished.
   </p><p>Within the precincts, to the right on passing the Gatehouse (where the <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Palace Hotel now stands), was the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="cruch,Almonry">Almonry</placeName></hi>, possessing an   endowment for male pensioners from   Henry VII., and for females from   his mother, the Countess of Richmond.   <num value="2">Two</num> chapels were connected with it, <num value="1">one</num> of which was commemorated in the name of <hi rend="italics">St. Annes Lane</hi>.

   </p><p>We have still left <num value="1">one</num> interesting point unvisited which <pb id="p.372" n="372"/> is connected with the Abbey. Beyond the Infirmary Garden were the cell of the Hermit, who, by ancient custom, was attached to the Abbey, and the ancient tower which formerly served as the <hi rend="italics">King's Jewel House</hi>. The latter remains. Its massive rugged walls and narrow Norman windows are best seen from the mews in <placeName key="bart,College Street">College Street</placeName>, entered by the gateway on the south of <placeName key="bart,Dean's Yard">Dean's Yard</placeName>. But to visit the interior it is necessary to ask admission at <num value="6">6</num>, Old <placeName key="cruch,Palace yard">Palace Yard</placeName>. The tower has been generally described as a building of Richard II., but it was more probably only bought by him, and it is most likely that it was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest portions of the Abbey, and contained the primitive Refectory and Dormitory used by the monks during the building of the principal edifice by the Confessor. A layer of Roman tiles has been discovered in the building.
   </p><p>The interior was evidently refitted by Abbot Littlington, and the exceedingly beautiful vaulted room on the basement story is of his time. The bosses of the roof are curious, especially <num value="1">one</num> with a face on every side. A small vaulted room opens out of the larger chamber. The upper chamber of the tower, which has its noble original chestnut roof, is now a small historical museum. Here are some of the old standards of weights and measures-those of Henry VII. being especially curious; the old Exchequer Tallies; Queen Elizabeth's Standard Ell and Yard, &amp;c. Here also are the <num value="6">six</num> horseshoes and <num value="61">sixty-one</num> nails which, by ancient custom, the sheriffs of London are compelled to count when they are sworn in. In the time of Edward II., when this custom was established, it was a proof of education, as only well-instructed men could count up to <num value="61">sixty-one</num>. At the same time it was ordained that the sheriff, in proof <pb id="p.373" n="373"/> of strength, should cut a bundle of sticks: this custom (the abolition of which has been vainly attempted) still exists, but a bundle of matches (!) is now provided. The original knife always has to be used.
   </p><p>There is a noble view of the Abbey from the platform   on the top of the Tower.   It will scarcely be credited by those who visit it, that the destruction of this interesting building is in contemplation, and that the present century, for the sake of making a <quote>regular</quote> street, will perhaps bear the stigma of having destroyed <num value="1">one</num> of the most precious buildings in <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, which, if the houses around it were cleared away (and it were preserved as a museum of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> antiquities), would be the greatest possible addition to the group of historic buildings to which it belongs.</p></div1> <pb id="p.374" n="374"/>

Here they lived in security under the shadow of the great neighbouring sanctuary, and <num value="1">one</num> after another saw arise, within the walls of their Palace, those Houses of Parliament which have now swallowed up the whole.

The palace was frequently enlarged and beautified afterwards, especially by William Rufus, who built the hall; by Stephen, who built the chapel, to which the finishing touches were given by Edward III.; and by Henry VIII., who built the Star Chamber.   Edward I. was born, and Edward IV. died, within the walls of the palace.

It was here also that Cromwell's daughter Elizabeth Claypole lay in state, and, long afterwards, Lord Chatham   and William Pitt.
    </p><p>The Star Chamber, which was rebuilt by Henry VIII., took its name from the gilt stars upon its ceiling. It was the terrible Court in which the functions of Prosecutor and  Judge were confounded, and where every punishment except death   could   be inflicted-imprisonment, pillory, branding, whipping, &amp;c. It was there that William, Bishop of Lincoln, was fined <measure key="5000l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> for calling Laud <quote>the great  Leviathan,</quote> and that John Lilburn, after being fined  <measure key="5000l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, was sentenced to the pillory, and to he whipped from <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.

It was burnt in <dateStruct value="1452--"><year reg="1452">1452</year></dateStruct>, but rebuilt by the brother of Elizabeth Woodville, Anthony, Earl Rivers, who left his heart to be buried there.
   </p><p>At the end of the old Palace, opening upon Old <placeName key="cruch,Palace yard">Palace Yard</placeName>, was the Prince's Chamber, built upon foundations of the Confessor's time, with walls <num value="7">seven</num> feet thick.

Cromwell's head, being embalmed, remained exposed to the atmosphere for <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years, and then <num value="1">one</num> stormy night it was blown down, and picked up by the sentry, who, hiding it under his cloak, took it home and secreted it in the chimney-corner, and, as enquiries were constantly being made about it by the Government, it was only on his deathbed that he revealed where he had hidden it. His family sold the head to <num value="1">one</num> of the Cambridgeshire Russells, and, in the same box in which it still is, it descended to a certain Samuel Russell, who, being a needy and careless man, exhibited it in a place near <placeName key="bart,Clare Market">Clare Market</placeName>.

He tried in vain to buy the head from Russell; for, poor as he was, nothing would at <num value="1">first</num> tempt him to part with the relic, but after a time Cox assisted him with money, and eventually, to clear himself from debt, he made the head over to Cox. When Cox at last parted with his museum, he sold the head of Cromwell for <measure key="230l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="230">230</num></measure> to <num value="3">three</num> men, who bought it about the time of the French Revolution to exhibit in Mead Court, <placeName key="bart,Bond Street">Bond Street</placeName>, at half a crown a head. Curiously enough, it happened that each of these <num value="3">three</num> gentlemen died a sudden death, and the head came into the possession of the <num value="3">three</num> nieces of the last man who died. These young ladies, nervous at keeping it in the house, asked Mr. Wilkinson, their medical man, to take care of it for them, and they subsequently sold it to him.

   </p><p>The circumstantial evidence is very curious. It is the only head in history which is known to have been embalmed and afterwards beheaded. On the back of the neck, above the vertebrae, is the mark of the cut of an axe where the executioner, having, perhaps, no proper block, had struck too high, and, laying the head in its soft embalmed state on the block, flattened the nose on <num value="1">one</num> side, making it adhere to the face. The hair grows promiscuously about the face, and the beard, stained to exactly the same colour by the embalming liquor, is tucked up under the chin with the oaken staff of the spear with which the head was stuck upon <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Hall, which staff is perforated by a worm that never attacks oak until it has been for many years exposed to the weather. The iron spear-head, where it protrudes above the skull, is rusted away by the action of the atmosphere. The jagged way in which the top of the skull is removed throws us back to a time when surgery was in its infancy, while the embalming is so beautifully done that the cellular process of the gums and the membrane of the tongue are still to be seen.</p></quote><bibl>-Letter signed 'Senex,'

   </p><p>The most important feature of the church is the east window, justly cited by Winston, the great authority on stained   glass, as the   most beautiful work as regards harmonious arrangement of colouring with which he is acquainted.   It was ordered by Ferdinand and Isabella to <pb id="p.394" n="394"/> be executed at Gouda in Holland, and was intended as a gift to the new chapel which Henry VII. was building, upon the marriage of their daughter Catherine with his eldest son Arthur. But the execution of the window occupied <num value="5">five</num> years, and before it was finished Prince Arthur was dead, and the chapel was finished. Henry VIII. presented the window to Waltham Abbey, and thence, on the Dissolution, the last abbot sent it for safety to his private chapel at New Hall, an estate which was afterwards purchased by Sir Thomas Boleyn, father of Queen Anne. The window remained at New Hall till the place became the property of General Monk, who took down the window and buried it, to preserve it from the Puritans, but replaced it in his chapel at the Restoration. After his death the chapel was pulled down, but the window was preserved and was eventually purchased by Mr. Conyers of Copt Hall in Essex, by whose son it was sold in <dateStruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></dateStruct> to the churchwardens of <placeName key="cruch,St. Margaret's church">St. Margaret's</placeName> for <measure key="400l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="400">400</num></measure>.<note id="n.394.1">Timbs's <title>Curiosities of London.</title></note>   Even then the window was not suffered to rest in peace, as the Dean and Chapter of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> looked upon it as <quote>a superstitious image and picture,</quote> and brought a lawsuit for its removal, which, after having been fought for <num value="7">seven</num> years, happily failed in the end.<note id="n.394.2">In memory of this triumph the then churchwarden presented to the parish the beautiful <title>Loving Cup of St. Margaret.</title></note>

Of such a character, which the dull overlook, and the gay despise, it was fit that the value should be made known, and the dignity established.

   <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>Let us look, for instance, at the list of the officers of Cranmer's household. It comprised a steward, treasurer, comptroller, gamators, clerk of the kitchen, caterer, clerk of the spicery, yeoman of the ewery, bakers, panthers, yeoman   of the horse, yeomen   ushers, butlers of wine and   ale, larderers,   squillaries, ushers of the hall, porters, ushers of the chamber, daily waiters in the great chamber, gentlemen   ushers, yeomen   of the chambers, marshal, groom ushers, almoners, cooks, chandlers, butchers, master of the horse, yeoman of the wardrobe, and harbingers. The state observed of course corresponded with such a retinue. There were generally <num value="3">three</num> tables spread in the hall, and served at the same time, at the <num value="1">first</num> of which sat the archbishop, surrounded by peers of the realm, privy-councillors, and gentlemen of the greatest quality; at the <num value="2">second</num>, called the Almoner's table, sat the chaplains and all the other clerical guests below the rank of diocesan bishops and abbots; and at the <num value="3">third</num>, or Steward's table, sat all the other gentlemen invited. Cardinal  Pole had a patent from   Philip and Mary to retain <num value="100">one hundred</num> servants. . . An interesting passage descriptive of the order observed in dining here in Archbishop Parker's time relates-- <quote>In the daily eating this was the custom: the steward, with the servants that were gentlemen of the better rank, sat down at the table in the hall on the right hand; and the almoners, with the clergy, and the other servants, sat on the other side, where there was plenty of all sorts of provision, both for eating and drinking. The daily fragments thereof did suffice to fill the bellies of a great number of poor hungry people that waited at the gate; and so constant and unfailing was this provision at my  Lord's table, that whosoever came in either at dinner or supper, being not above the degree of a knight, might here be entertained worthy of his quality, either at the steward's or almoner's table. And moreover, it was the Archbishop's command to all his servants, that all strangers should be received and treated with all manner of civility and respect, and that places at the table should be assigned them according to their dignity and quality, which abounded much to the praise and commendation of the Archbishop. The discourse and conversation at meals <pb id="p.422" n="422"/> was void of all brawls and loud talking, and for the most part consisted in framing men's manners to religion, or to some other honest and beseeming subject. There was a monitor of the hall; and if it happened that any spoke too loud, or concerning things less decent, it was presently hushed by <num value="1">one</num> that cried silence. The Archbishop loved hospitality, and no man showed it so much, or with better order, though he himself was very abstemious.</quote> </quote><bibl>-Saunders in C.

    <quote rend="blockquote"><p>Thomas More, of the city of London, was of an honourable, though not a noble family, and possessed considerable literary attainments. After having, as a young man, practised for some years at the bar, and served as sheriff for his native city, he was summoned to the palace and made a member of the Privy Council by the invincible king Henry VIII. (who received the distinction unattained by any other sovereign, of being justly called Defender of the Faith, which he had supported both with his sword and pen). He was then made a knight and vice-treasurer, and through excessive royal favour was created chancellor, <num value="1">first</num> of the Duchy of Lancaster, and afterwards of England. In the mean time, he had been returned to serve in Parliament, and was besides frequently appointed ambassador by his Majesty. The last time he filled this high office was at Cambray, where he had for a colleague, as chief of legation, Tunstall, Bishop of London, soon afterwards of Durham, a man scarcely excelled by any of his contemporaries in learning, prudence, and moral worth; at this place he was present at the assembly of the most powerful monarchs of Christendom, and beheld with pleasure the renewal of ancient treaties, and the restoration of a long-wished--for peace to the world.  <quote>Grant, O ye Gods, that this peace may be eternal!</quote>
   </p><p> In this round of duties and honours he acquired the esteem of the best of princes, the nobility and people, and was dreaded only by thieves and murderers (and heretics).<note id="n.442.2">Fuller says that More had a tree in his garden at <placeName key="cruch,Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> which he called  <quote>the tree of truth,</quote> and that he.used to bind heretics to it to be scourged.</note> At length his father, Sir John <pb id="p.443" n="443"/> More, was nominated by the king a member of the Privy Council. He was of a mild, harmless, gentle, merciful, and just disposition, and was in excellent health, though an old man. When he had seen his son Chancellor of England, he felt that his life had been sufficiently prolonged, and passed gladly from earth to heaven.
   </p><p>At his death, the son, who in his father's lifetime was esteemed a young man both by himself and others, deeply lamenting his father's loss, and seeing <num value="4">four</num> children and <num value="11">eleven</num> grandchildren around him, began to feel the pressure of years.   Shortly afterwards this feeling was increased by a pulmonary affection, which he regarded as the sure forerunner of old age. Therefore, wearied of worldly enjoyments, he obtained permission from the best of princes to resign his dignities, that he might spend the closing years of his life free from care, which he had always desired, and that, withdrawing his mind from the occupations of this world, he might devote himself to the contemplation of immortality. As a constant reminder of the inevitable approach of death, he has prepared this vault, whither he has removed the remains of his <num value="1">first</num> wife. Good Reader, I beseech thee, that thy pious prayers may attend me while living, and follow me when dead, that I may not have done this in vain, nor dread with trembling the approach of death, but willingly undergo it for Christ's sake, and that death to me may not be really death, but rather the door of a more blessed life.</p></quote>

   </p><p>Holland House was originally built in <dateStruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></dateStruct> by Sir Walter Cope, on land which had belonged to the De Veres, Earls of Oxford. Sir Walter, who was Gentleman of the Bedchamber to James I., called it Cope Castle, but it soon changed its name, for his only daughter Isabel married Sir Henry Rich, the favourite of the Duke of Buckingham, described by Clarendon as <quote>a very handsome man, of a lovely and winning presence, and gentle conversation,</quote> <note id="n.464.1">His noble portrait, by Vandyke, is at <placeName key="cruch,Montague house">Montague House</placeName>.</note> who was created Lord Kensington in <dateStruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></dateStruct>, and <pb id="p.465" n="465"/> Earl of Holland in <dateStruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></dateStruct>. In the Civil Wars he abandoned the Parliamentarian for the Royalist cause, and, being taken prisoner at St. Neots, was beheaded at <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, beautiful to the last, in his white satin dress, on the <dateStruct value="1648-03-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1648">1648</year></dateStruct>-<num value="9">9</num>.
   </p><p>It was the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Holland who added the wings and arcades, in fact who gave Holland House all its characteristics. After his execution the house was inhabited by General Fairfax, and (<dateStruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></dateStruct>) by General Lambert, but the Countess of Holland was eventually allowed to return to her old home, where she comforted her widowhood by indulging privately in the theatricals so strictly forbidden by the Puritan Government. Her son, the <num value="2">second</num> Earl of Holland, became <num value="5">fifth</num> Earl of Warwick, through the death of his cousin, in <dateStruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></dateStruct>.   His son was Edward, Earl of Warwick, who died in <dateStruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></dateStruct>, and whose widow (Charlotte, daughter of Sir Thomas Middleton of Chirk) married Joseph Addison, <quote>famous for many excellent works,</quote> as he is described in the announcement of his marriage in
<title>The Political State of Great <placeName key="cruch,Britain">Britain</placeName>,</title> for <dateStruct value="1716-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1716">1716</year></dateStruct>. Dr. Johnson says that the marriage was <quote>on terms very much like those on which a Turkish princess is espoused, to whom the Sultan is reported to pronounce- <quote> Daughter, I give thee this man for thy slave.</quote>  At any rate Addison's married life was not happy, though it was of short duration, for on <dateStruct value="1719-06-17"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="17">17</day>, <year reg="1719">1719</year></dateStruct>, he died at Holland House (leaving an only daughter who died unmarried), grasping the hand of the young Earl of Warwick, when he asked his dying commands, and saying,  <quote> See in what peace a Christian can die.</quote> </quote>
    </p><p>The Earl of Warwick, who was Addison's step-son, only <pb id="p.466" n="466"/> survived him <num value="2">two</num> years, and was succeeded by his cousin William Edwardes (created Baron Kensington in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>), who sold Holland House in <dateStruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></dateStruct> to Henry Fox, <num value="1">first</num> Lord Holland.
   </p><p>The fortunes of the Fox family were founded by Sir Stephen Fox, who gained the favour of Charles II. by being the <num value="1">first</num> to announce the death of Cromwell to him at Brussels. He was made Clerk of the Green Cloth and Paymaster of the Forces, and acquired a great fortune, <quote>honestly got and unenvied, which is nigh to a miracle,</quote> says Evelyn. Sir Stephen Fox, <quote>of a sweet nature, well-spoken, well-bred, and so highly in his Majesty's esteem,</quote> was the practical founder of <placeName key="cruch,Chelsea hospital">Chelsea Hospital</placeName>, as well as of many other charitable institutions.   By deserting the cause of James II. he continued to enjoy Court favour till his death in <dateStruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></dateStruct>, when Anne was on the throne. His <num value="2">second</num> son, the son of his <num value="2">second</num> wife, was Henry Fox, the Secretary of State and Paymaster of the Forces. It was with him that Lady Caroline Lennox, the Duke of Richmond's daughter-after she had cut off her eyebrows to protect herself from an unwelcome marriage arranged by her father-eloped in <dateStruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></dateStruct>. Having endured the fury of her parents for <num value="4">four</num> years, she was forgiven on the birth of her eldest son. Henry Fox was created Lord Holland after his purchase of Holland House, where he died in <dateStruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></dateStruct>. His son Stephen, who succeeded him, only survived him <num value="6">six</num> months, and left an only son, Henry, <num value="3">third</num> Lord Holland, who was educated under the guardianship of his uncle, Charles James Fox, the famous orator and statesman.
   </p><p>Under the <num value="3">third</num> Lord Holland, Holland House attained <pb id="p.467" n="467"/> a splendour and beauty which it had never acquired before, and it became an intellectual centre, not only for England, but for the world. Its master is remembered as the most genial of mankind; Lady Holland, though wayward and fanciful, was also beautiful and clever; Miss Fox, Lord Holland's sister, was loving, gracious, and charitable. Sydney Smith, Luttrell, and Allen were habitu&#x00E9;s of the house, and had their fixed apartments assigned to them.   The list of guests included Sheridan, Blanco White, Parr, Byron, George Ellis, Lord Jeffrey, Payne Knight, Thurlow, Eldon, Brougham, Lyndhurst, Sir Humphry Davy, Count Romford, Lord Aberdeen, Lord Moira, Windham, Curran, Sir Samuel Romilly, Washington Irving, Pozzo di Borgo, Counts Montholon and Bertrand, Princess Lieven, the Humboldts, Talleyrand, Tom   Moore, Madame de Stael, Macaulay.   Daily all that was most brilliant in European society was welcomed uninvited to the hospitable dinner-table.   It was no wonder that Sydney Smith heard <quote><num value="500">five hundred</num> travelled men assert that there was no such agreeable house as Holland House.</quote>
   </p><p>The <num value="3">third</num> Lord Holland died in <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>, and was succeeded by his son, British Minister at Florence. He died in <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>. Under his widow, Mary Augusta, Lady Holland, daughter of the <num value="8">eighth</num> Earl of Coventry, Holland House still has the reputation of being the most charming house in England.
    </p><p>As we pass the terrace which bounds the garden and enter the deep belt of shade which encircles the mansion, the most conspicuous feature is a gateway with stone piers by  Inigo Jones bearing the arms of Rich, approached by a <pb id="p.468" n="468"/> double flight of steps enclosing a fountain. The house is now entered from the east side; originally the entrance was on the south, and it was there that William Penn, to whom Holland House was let for a time, narrates that he could scarcely get down the steps through the crowd of suitors who besought him to use his good offices with the king in their behalf.

Every turn is a picture: Art has combined with Nature to make it so, and has never intruded upon Nature. A raised terrace, like some of those which belong to old Genoese palaces, leads from the house, high amongst the branches of the trees, to the end of the flower-garden opposite the West Rooms, where a line of arches festooned with creepers--a picturesque relic of the old stables-forms the background. <figure id="Fig.032" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.034.DO01.00032"><head>The Lily Garden, Holland House.</head></figure>  Facing a miniature Dutch garden here is <quote>Rogers' Seat,</quote> inscribed-

   <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>Yet a few years, and the shades and structures may follow their illustrious masters. The wonderful city which, ancient and gigantic as it is, still continues to grow as fast as a young town of logwood by a water-privilege in Michigan, may soon displace those turrets and gardens which are associated with so much that is interesting and noble, with the courtly magnificence of Rich, with the loves of Ormond, with the counsels of Cromwell, with the death of Addison. The time is coming when, perhaps, a few old men, the last survivors of our generation, will in vain seek, amidst new streets, and squares, and railway stations, for the site of that dwelling which was in their youth the favourite resort of wits and beauties, of painters and poets, of scholars, philosophers, and statesmen. They will then remember, with strange tenderness, many objects once familiar to them, the avenue and terrace, the busts and the paintings, the carving, the grotesque gilding, and the enigmatical mottoes. With peculiar fondness they will recall that venerable chamber, in which all the antique gravity of a college library was so singularly blended with all that female grace and wit could devise to embellish a drawing-room. They will recollect, not unmoved, those shelves loaded with the varied learning of many lands and many ages, and those portraits in which were preserved the features <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> of the best and wisest Englishmen of <num value="2">two</num> generations. They will recollect how many men who have guided the politics of Europe, who have moved great assemblies by reason and eloquence, who have put life into bronze and canvas, or who have left to posterity things so written as it shall not willingly let them die, were there mixed with all that was loveliest and gayest in the society of the most splendid of capitals. These will remember the peculiar character which belonged to that circle, in which every talent and accomplishment, every art and science, had its place. They will remember how the last debate was discussed in <num value="1">one</num> corner, and the last comedy of Scribe in another; while Wilkie gazed with modest admiration on Sir Joshua's Baretti; while Mackintosh turned over Thomas Aquinas to verify a quotation; while Talleyrand related his conversations with Barras at the Luxembourg, or his ride with Lannes over the field of Austerlitz. They will remember, above all, the grace, and the kindness, far more admirable than grace, with which the princely hospitality of that ancient mansion was dispensed. They will remember the venerable and benignant countenance and the cordial voice of him who bade them welcome. They will remember that temper which years of pain, of sickness, of lameness, of confinement, seemed only to make sweeter and sweeter, and that frank politeness, which at once relieved all the embarrassment of the youngest and most timid writer or artist, who found himself for the <num value="1">first</num> time among Ambassadors and Earls. They will remember that constant flow of conversation, so natural, so animated, so various, so rich with observation and anecdote; that wit which never gave a wound; that exquisite mimicry, which ennobled instead of degrading; that goodness of heart which appeared in every look and accent, and gave additional value to every talent and acquirement. They will remember, too, that he whose name they hold in reverence was not less distinguished by the inflexible uprightness of his political conduct, than by his loving disposition and his winning manners. They will remember that, in the last lines which he traced, he expressed his joy that he had done nothing unworthy of the friend of Fox and Grey; and they will have reason to feel similar joy, if, in looking back on many troubled years, they cannot accuse themselves of having done anything unworthy of men who were distinguished by the friendship of Lord Holland.</quote><bibl>-Macaulay.</bibl></cit></quote></p> </div1>

   </p><p>Hence we reach the <hi rend="italics">North Gallery</hi>, which contains the celebrated <hi rend="italics">Cartoons of Raffaelle</hi>, being the original designs (drawn with chalk upon strong paper and coloured in distemper) by Raffaelle and his scholars, especially Francesco Penni, for the tapestries ordered by Leo X. to cover the lower walls of the Sistine Chapel, the upper part being already clothed with the glorious frescoes which still adorn them. There were originally <num value="11">eleven</num> Cartoons, but <num value="4">four</num> are lost-The Stoning of Stephen, The Conversion of St. Paul, St. Paul in his Dungeon at Philippi, and the Coronation of the Virgin, which last was intended to fill the space above the altar. The tapestries were executed at Arras, and were hence called <hi rend="italics">Arazzi</hi>. They were worked under the superintendence of Bernard   van   Orley, a Dutch   pupil of Raffaelle, and were hung up in the Sistine, on <placeName key="cruch,St. Stephen's church">St. Stephen's</placeName> Day, <dateStruct value="1519-12-26"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg="26">26</day>, <year reg="1519">1519</year></dateStruct>. <num value="8">Eight</num> years after, they were carried off in the sack of Rome by the French, but were restored to Julius III. by the Constable Anne de Montmorency.   In <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct> they were again carried off by the French, and passing through various hands, were repurchased by Pius VII. in <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct> from a Frenchman named Devaux, at Genoa. Though greatly faded and much injured by bad restoration, they still hang in the Vatican. <pb id="p.483" n="483"/>
   </p><p>The <num value="7">seven</num> Cartoons, which alone exist now, lay neglected in the manufactory at Arras till they were seen there in <dateStruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></dateStruct> by Rubens, who advised Charles I. to purchase them for a tapestry manufactory which was established at Mortlake. On the death of Charles, Cromwell bought them for <measure key="300l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="300">300</num></measure>.   They remained almost forgotten at <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> till the time of William III., who removed them to <placeName key="bart,Hampton Court">Hampton Court</placeName>, where a room was built for them by Wren, in which they hung till they were brought to South Kensington. Tapestry workers have twice cut them into strips and pricked the outlines with their needles, <num value="1">first</num> at Arras, and afterwards at Mortlake, where several copies were executed. A splendid set of tapestries worked from the Cartoons whilst they were at Arras (probably ordered by Henry VIII.) was in the collection of Charles I. at <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>, and was purchased, after his death, by the Duke of Alva : they are now in the Royal Museum at Berlin.

The priests, who mistake the apostles for Mercury and Jupiter, are hastening forward with bulls for the sacrifice, and a man is bringing in a ram. Paul is about to rend his garments in his indignation at the idolatry of the people, and Barnabas, clasping his hands, prays that it may be arrested. A young man, observing the distress of the apostles, tries to stop the sacrifice, and already, in some of the faces at the edge of the picture, is evinced the change in the temper of the people of Lystra, who afterwards stoned Paul.

The galleries on the ground-floor are occupied by objects <pb id="p.496" n="496"/> illustrative of the Natural Products. Minerals, and Zoology of India.   On the upper-floor are specimens of Indian Manufactures. In Room IX. are the principal curiosities, which were formerly shown at the <placeName key="cruch,East India house">East India House</placeName>- Runjeet Singh's golden throne, and Tippoo Saib's Tiger, taken at Seringapatam, which was made by mechanism to growl, and the Englishman it is supposed to be devouring, to scream, for his amusement. The passage by which the lower galleries are reached is occupied by the curious sculptures brought in <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct> from the Amravati Tope on the river Kistna in the district of Guntoor in Madras.</p> 
   
<p>The dull <rs type="Subject">Horticultural Gardens</rs> occupy the site of those of Loudon and Wise, whose collection of trees and shrubs was so much eulogised by Evelyn.   To the south-west of these, at the junction of <placeName key="bart,Cromwell Road">Cromwell Road</placeName> and <placeName key="bart,Gloucester Road">Gloucester Road</placeName>, stood Gloucester Lodge, built for the Duchess of Gloucester and inhabited by Princess Sophia, and afterwards by George Canning.

<p>Returning to the <placeName key="bart,Brompton Road">Brompton Road</placeName>, we find the <placeName key="bart,Fulham Road">Fulham Road</placeName> running southwards.

<p>[The road leads through Walham Green to <rs type="Subject">Fulham</rs>, which, though <num value="4">four</num> miles from <placeName key="bart,Hyde Park Corner">Hyde Park Corner</placeName>, requires a cursory mention here as the home of the Bishops of London.</p> 
  
<p>Fulham, which, according to Camden, means <quote>the place of fowles,</quote> but, according to most authorities, <quote>the place of dirt,</quote> is a pretty antiquated village with a wooden bridge over the Thames. The Inn of the Golden Lion existed in the time of Henry VII., and was for some time the residence of Bishop Bonner. At another tavern, the King's Arms, the Fire of London was annually commemorated on September i, in honour of its having given refuge to a number of city fugitives. The perpendicular <rs type="Subject">Church of All Saints</rs>, which stands near the river, contains a great number of interesting monuments.   We may especially notice that of John Viscount Mordaunt of Avalon, father of the great Earl of Peterborough, <hi rend="italics">ob</hi>. <dateStruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></dateStruct>, by Bushnell, sculptor of the figures on <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName>, with a statue by Bird; the noble monument by Gibbons to Dorothy Hyliard, <dateStruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></dateStruct>, wife of Sir W. Clarke, Secretary at War to Charles II., and afterwards of Samuel Barrow, physician to the same, author of the Latin verses prefixed to <title>Paradise Lost;</title> the simple altar tomb of Sir William Butts, <dateStruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></dateStruct>, the physician <pb id="p.498" n="498"/> to Henry VIII., mentioned by Shakspeare; the quaint monument of Margaret, wife of Sir Peter Legh of Lyme, <dateStruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></dateStruct>, and her <num value="2">two</num> babies; the mural monuments of Thomas Carlos, <dateStruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></dateStruct>, son of the Colonel Careless who hid Charles II. in the oak, and was allowed to change his name to Carlos as a reward; of Thomas Smith, Master of Requests to James I., <dateStruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></dateStruct>; of Bishop Gibson, <dateStruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></dateStruct>; Bishop Porteus, <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>; and Bishop Blomfield, <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>. An admirable Flemish brass commemorates Margaret Swanders, <dateStruct value="1529--"><year reg="1529">1529</year></dateStruct>.   In the churchyard are the monuments of Sir Francis Child, <dateStruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></dateStruct>, and of Theodore Hook, <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>.   On the eastern side of the church are the tombs of a number of the bishops (beginning at the church wall)-Lowth, <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>; Terrick, <dateStruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></dateStruct>; Randolph, <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>; Gibson, <dateStruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></dateStruct>; Sherlock, <dateStruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></dateStruct>; Compton, <dateStruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></dateStruct>; Hayter, <dateStruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></dateStruct>; Robinson, <dateStruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></dateStruct>. Near the tomb of his patron, Bishop Compton, lies Richard Fiddes, author of the Life of Cardinal Wolsey.

<p>A drive through an avenue, or (from the church) a raised causeway called <quote>the <placeName key="cruch,Bishop's walk">Bishop's Walk</placeName>,</quote> leads to <rs type="Subject">Fulham Palace</rs>, the ancient manor-house of the Bishops of London. A gateway is the approach to a quaint picturesque courtyard surrounded by low buildings of red and black bricks, erected by Bishop Fitzjames in the reign of Henry VII. The interior of the palace is unimportant, though the Library contains a number of episcopal portraits, including that of Bishop Ridley, whose <num value="4">four</num> years' residence here is <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting periods in the history of the palace. Under his hospitable roof the mother and sister of his predecessor, Bonner, continued to reside, ever-welcome <pb id="p.499" n="499"/> guests at his table, where the place of honour was always reserved for <quote>our mother, Bonner.</quote>   The palace gardens were filled with rare shrubs by Bishop Grindal, who was a great gardener: they still contain a very fine cork-tree. A picturesque garden-gateway bears the arms of Bishop Fitzjames. The <hi rend="italics">Chapel</hi>, in the garden, was built by Butterfield for Bishop Tait, <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>.
