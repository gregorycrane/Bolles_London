<p>THIS little volume pretends to be no more than <q>a book
     of gossip.</q> I have attempted, as a Londoner following
a career necessitating the playing of many parts, to give
some sketches of the Great Metropolis, as I know it at
the end of the Century. I can scarcely claim for my work
that it is very deep, but I trust that it may be read by those
who honour me with their attention with interest. I have
tried to give a picture of London and Londoners as they
exist.  Here and there I have travelled with my fellow
citizens out of town. When I have done this it has been
<q>under doctor's orders,</q> or when London has been holiday
making far away from home, on the festivals of St. Lubbock.</p>

  <p>My ambition has been limited to the production of a
book that may be read by those who have an idle hour to
spare for cheerful recollections, and, to use the old phrase,
by those who are anxious to <q> acquire information combined
with amusement.</q></p>
  <p><q> London at the End of the Century </q> is a title full of
possibilities. In my hands it has become the name of a
book that has afforded me infinite pleasure to write; I only
hope that I shall be able to share that pleasure with my
readers.</p>

<p>WHAT perhaps will strike an intelligent foreigner--
and every foreigner who visits the metropolis is considered intelligent--on his entrance to London at
the end of the century, will be the hoardings and
their placards. He will find these records of the
time of very great merit in many directions, for
now-a-days our bill-posting has frequently the artistic
assistance of eminent supporters of the Royal
Academy. He will learn that the modern Babylon
has numberless theatres, hotels, and newspapers. If
he has visited the old ground before-say twenty
years ago, for so important an incident as a journey
to England is not to be undertaken too frequently-
he will notice that what were once units have become
scores. If he is standing opposite the advertisement

<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>


station in front of the Hotel Cecil, he will only have
to right-about turn and take a diagonal march into
the Adelphi theatre to see in the saloon of that
popular place of entertainment a painting of a
hoarding by the late John Parry, bearing the artist's
signature, dated <date value="1844">1844</date>. Comparing the actuality with
the canvas, he will readily understand the enormous
progress that has been made during the last fifty
years. At the time when the famous entertainer, who
found a successor in the late Corney Grain, was
singing for a livelihood and using his palette as a
distraction, railway travelling was in its babyhood,
and marine excursions chiefly represented by a very
primitive steam boat, built by the General Steam
Navigation Company, and bound for Margate. A
few weekly papers suggested that journalism was
also in its infancy.  In <date value="1844">1844</date> we had no <hi rend="italic">Daily
Telegraph</hi>; The <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> existed,
but its present pictorial contemporaries had to be
created. During the century which has come to its
last days I have played many parts; civil servant,
barrister, private secretary, playwright, and novelist;
but the chief role that I have filled since the years
closed over my boyhood has been journalistic. Under
these circumstances it is not unnatural that, when
writing of London at the end of the century, <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>,
and all that <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> means to a pressman,
should first attract my attention.</p>

<pb id="p.3" n="3"/>




  </div2><div2 n="JUPITER OF PRINTING HOUSE SQUARE" type="subchapter" id="s2"><head><q>JUPITER</q> OF PRINTING HOUSE SQUARE.</head>

  <p>It rejoices my heart to find that <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>
retains a foremost rank in the list of London
daily papers.  I say this because my father,
the late Gilbert Abbott &#x0026; Beckett, metropolitan
police magistrate and man of letters, was, so far
as I know, and I have seen the assertion also
made by a writer not of our blood, the only
man who ever wrote the entire series of leaders in
one morning issue of Printing House Square.  It
came about in this way. My father had an agreement with <hi rend="italic">The Times </hi>to write a daily article.
One of these contributions had been crowded out,
and stood over to appear with the copy supplied by
him in due course on the following day. At the
last moment a subject, of which he had a special
knowledge, came to the front--I fancy it was
connected with the Andover Union, an institution
visited by my father as a poor law commissioner--
and consequently the duty of supplying a commentary fell to him. I have a dim recollection of a
<q>printers' devil</q> waiting in the hall of Hyde Park
Gate while my father scribbled sheet after sheet, and
then hearing the front door slam as the little
messenger started away on his return journey. Thus
it was that the three leading articles of <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> on

<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>






the following morning came from the same pen. This
incident, which is naturally interesting to myself, is
yet instructive to others, as it marks the change in the
<foreign lang="LA">modus operandi</foreign> of conducting a large daily paper.
At the present time a contributor would probably be
in telephonic communication with the office, and
dictate from his study the copy intended for the
composing room many miles away.    One of my
friends, who is head of the reporting staff in the
Gallery of the House of Commons during the Session,
habitually uses this means of communication when
sending the summary of the night's doings from
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> to Bouverie Street. This improvement
is one of scores that have been introduced during the
last thirty or forty years by the proprietors of The
Times, who were the first to adopt the wonderful
machinery that supplies newspapers by thousands in
the same time that once was occupied in turning out
a fortieth of the number. The motto of the paper in
the early forties was <q>the best,</q> and that motto has
seen no change for half a century.</p></div2>


    <div2 n="THE STANDARD AND ITS PARTNER" type="subchapter" id="s3"><head> <q>THE STANDARD</q> AND ITS PARTNER.</head>

  <p>It would be invidious to single out for special
commendation any particular paper, when all are of
admirable quality. Perhaps I may be pardoned for
referring to <hi rend="italics">The Standard</hi>, which still retains its

<pb id="p.5" n="5"/>




prestige, as an old contributor of thirty years ago.
In <dateRange from="1870" to="1871">1870-71</dateRange> I had the honour of serving as a special
correspondent during the Franco-German war, on
the banks of the Rhine, and wherever else I could
find a French prisoner. <hi rend="italics">The Standard</hi> may be, I
think, considered the pioneer of cheap journalism.
In the old days there were two editions, practically
the same paper, one called <hi rend="italics">The Herald</hi>, and the other
<hi rend="italics">The Standard</hi>. The first has higher priced than the
second, which was intended to suit the pockets of the
poor or economical.  <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> used to call the two
journals <hi rend="italics">Mrs. Gamp</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Mrs. Harris</hi>, from the two
characters in <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName>'s novel. It will be remembered
that <hi rend="italics">Mrs. Harris</hi> was the echo of <hi rend="italics">Mrs. Gamp</hi>. Years
after the absorption of <hi rend="italics">The Herald</hi> in <hi rend="italics">The Standard</hi>,
my editor, Captain Hamber, in giving me my final
instructions said: -</p>
  <p><q>Look here; as your copy may be tampered with
by the Prussians, you had better address the envelope
with an assumed name.</q></p>
  <p><q>What shall it be?</q> I asked.</p>
  <p><q>Why not resume your acquaintance with <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>'s
friend, and write to me at Shoe Lane, as Mrs.
Harris ? </q></p>
  <p>And I adopted this suggestion.</p>
  <p>It was fortunate that I did, for I <q>got through</q> a
piece of news that never reached town by wire--the
story of an attempted escape at Coblenz.</p>
</div2>

    <div2 n="CONCERNING The Morning Post" type="subchapter" id="s4">  <head>CONCERNING "<hi rend="italics">The Morning Post</hi>."</head>

  <p>Although every daily paper at the end of the
century has its <q>Society paragraph,</q> <hi rend="italics">The Morning Post</hi> is certainly the journal of journals associated
with that august body once known as the <q>upper ten
thousand,</q> and now describable as the <q> moneyed half
million.</q> Its change in price from threepence to a
penny was an experiment that was watched with the
deepest interest in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>.  It marked an
importent event in social history. <hi rend="italics">The Morning Post</hi>
has, during the last sixty or seventy years, been
regarded as the organ of the aristocracy, and by the
change in its price has brought economy into fashion.
Two or three decades ago a duke, much less a
duchess, would never have thought of riding in an
omnibus. At the present time some of the 'busses
have the most distinguished <foreign lang="FR">clientele</foreign>. In the fifties
it was thought the thing to keep up appearances to
any extent. Lord Lytton, in his comedy of <q> Money,</q>
showed a spendthrift, impecunious baronet paying a
man about town a small salary to call him <q> Stingy
Jack,</q> to conceal the emptiness of his coffers.
Today it is quite the mode to talk of one's poverty.
Another remarkable thing connected with the change
of price in <hi rend="italics">The Morning Post</hi> is that, in spite of the
reduction, the paper was never better edited. It is

<pb id="p.7" n="7"/>





as full as of yore of all that goes to make a London
daily the finest journal in the world.</p></div2>


     <div2 n="STATE RECOGNITION OF JOURNALISM" type="subchapter" id="s5"><head>STATE RECOGNITION OF JOURNALISM.</head>

  <p>Leaving <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> out of the question as a paper
that insists upon the ultra dignity of the Press, as an
abstract rather than as a profession, <hi rend="italics">The Daily Telegraph</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">The Morning Post</hi> have done more
than any other papers to raise the status of a
journalist. The proprietors of these distinguished
broadsheets, by putting themselves at the heads of
such bodies as the Newspaper Society and the Institute of Journalists, have obtained that recognition of
which the helmet of the baronet or the coronet of
the peer are a testimony. <hi rend="italics">The Daily Telegraph</hi> can
claim to have introduced the essayist as distinguishable from the reporter into journalism. The rigid
lines of the gentleman who counted his remuneration
by the copper coins of the realm were elaborated
into decorative as well as descriptive sentences. The
<q> young lions of Peterborough Court</q> taught a senior
generation that the public loved their (the lions')
roaring better than the more peaceful cooings (concoctions of paragraphs, old style) of the past. Nay,
more, <hi rend="italics">The Daily Telegraph</hi>, joining hands with
<hi rend="italics">The New York Herald</hi>, undertook enterprises that were
shunned, or at any rate overlooked, by the Government.
<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>





The <soCalled>D. T.</soCalled> discovered <persName key="Livingstone, David">Livingstone</persName> and Emin Pasha, and, as I write, is on the eve of surveying the still unknown Africa from Egypt to the
Cape. It has been the first to lead a crusade in the
cause of charity, or in the recognition of those who
have deserved well of their country. All honour to
<hi rend="italics">The Daily Telegraph</hi> and those responsible for its
management.
</p></div2>

     <div2 n="THE ORIGIN OF THE DAILY NEWS" type="subchapter" id="s6"><head>THE ORIGIN OF <q>THE DAILY NEWS.</q></head>

  <p>For the sake of <soCalled>Auld Lang Syne</soCalled> I have always
taken an interest in <hi rend="italic">The Daily News</hi>. It was started
by the proprietors when the expiring century had
scarcely reached middle age. It was associated with
<persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> and Douglas Jerrold, and <hi rend="italics">The Express</hi>,
edited by my old and valued friend, Sir John
Robinson, in the early fifties, had for one of its
contributors my father, then writing for <hi rend="italics">The Morning
Herald</hi> and <hi rend="italics">The Illustrated London News</hi>. To this
day its connection with <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> is unbroken, for my
friend, Mr. H. W. Lucy, contributes articles anent
Parliament for both papers--<q> Pictures for the News,</q>
and <q>Essence</q> for the <hi rend="italics"><q>Charivari.</q></hi>   Again, the
editorial offices in Bouverie Street face one another,
and in Pressland the claims of neighbourhood are
recognised. Writing as a <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> man, I pray that the
pleasant <foreign lang="FR">entente cordiale</foreign> may long continue.</p></div2>

<pb id="p.9" n="9"/>




      <div2 n="THE CHRONICLE UP TO DATE" type="subchapter" id="s7"><head><q>THE CHRONICLE</q> UP TO DATE.</head>

  <p><hi rend="italics">The Daily Chronicle</hi> has a
  remarkable and distinguished record.  Earlier in the century it was
known by the name of a district. Then <hi rend="italics">The Morning
Chronicle</hi>, after struggling as the organ of a foreign
potentate, virtually ceased to exist.  Then <hi rend="italics">The
Clerkenwell News</hi>, eminently successful as a local,
blossomed forth into an equally successful London
daily, under the title of <hi rend="italics">The Daily Chronicle</hi>. It has
flourished from the first. If it has any fault, it can
be found in its politics. But I may be wrong, the
more especially as my sympathies are enlisted with
the other side. But from a journalistic point of view
the paper is first rate. And this opinion of
mine-not offered after the fashion of Sir Hubert Stanley-
is endorsed in the most practicable manner imaginable
by the public.</p></div2>

           <div2 n="PICTURES TO THE FRONT" type="subchapter" id="s8"><head>PICTURES TO THE FRONT.</head>

  <p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the end of the
century in connection with the Press, is the growth
of illustration.  Until the establishment of <hi rend="italics">The
Illustrated London News</hi>, the metropolis had no
paper relying more upon pictures than letterpress for
its popularity. <hi rend="italics">The Observer</hi> and <hi rend="italics">The Sunday Times</hi>
-survivors of the fittest-had numerous sketches of

<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>



striking events from time to time, in the earlier years
of the <persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName>'s reign, but news, rather than the
illustration thereof, was their speciality. Nowadays
both papers to which I have referred have dropped
the pencil for the pen. No doubt photography and
the rapidity with which engraving can, in these later
days, be accomplished, have had much to do with the
development of the limner's art in its relation to daily
publications. <hi rend="italics">The Daily Graphic</hi> was to thousands a
revelation, and has stimulated many of its contemporaries to increased exertion in the direction of
pictoral reproduction. Printers' ink passes over, with
gratifying results, not only type, but blocks. This
would have been impossible half a century ago.
Thanks to modern improvements, when the writer
can be assisted by the artist in daily journalism the
work of both is available.</p>
</div2>

    <div2 n="THE GROWTH OF THE EVENING PAPER" type="subchapter" id="s9"><head>THE GROWTH OF THE EVENING PAPER.</head>

  <p>Another remarkable development of the Press at
the end of the century is the growth of the evening
paper. In the sixties I had the honour to edit <hi rend="italic">The
Glowworm</hi>, which made its appearance in the same
year as, but a little earlier than, The <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall
Gazette</hi>.  We modelled our publication on <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>
originals. We gave the lists of the plays of the
moment, after the fashion of The <foreign lang="FR">Entr'acte</foreign> and a

<pb id="p.11" n="11"/>



<foreign lang="FR">feuilleton</foreign>. Even in those days I soon discovered the
value of <q>latest sporting,</q> and did my best to outdo
the accounts of races published in the last edition
of <hi rend="italic">The Evening Standard</hi>. There were in existence
<hi rend="italic">The Evening Star</hi> (the afternoon version of the organ
of John Bright), <hi rend="italic">The Globe</hi> (then, as now, an admirable
paper), and <hi rend="italic">The Express</hi>, issuing from the offices of
<hi rend="italic">The Daily News</hi>.    I thought myself particularly
<q>smart</q> in my salad days, because I managed to
get my second edition-we had no first-into the
hands of the public shortly after two o'clock. Nowadays
half-a-dozen evening papers are selling long
before that hour.  <hi rend="italic">The Pall Mall Gazette</hi> (now
edited by my old and valued friend, Sir Douglas
Straight, one of my colleagues on <hi rend="italic">The Glowworm</hi>)
soon followed, describing itself as <q>a Review,</q> as well
as an evening paper. I remember that we <hi rend="italic">Glowworms</hi>
considered ourselves extremely clever because we
referred to the <hi rend="italic">P.M.G.</hi> as <q>our sporting contemporary.</q>
Then came <hi rend="italic">The Echo</hi> (I had used the title
earlier for a weekly <foreign lang="FR">rechauffe</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">The Glowworm</hi>), and,
later still, <hi rend="italic">The St. James's</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName></hi>. As I
write, <hi rend="italic">Evening News</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Evening Stars</hi> compete at
a halfpenny with their higher-priced contemporaries.
When <hi rend="italic">The Glowworm</hi>-a four-paged sheet-was
started, it was considered a marvel of cheapness at
a penny, and <hi rend="italic">The Pall Mall Gazette</hi> (smaller than at
present) most reasonable at twice the money.</p></div2>

<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>




             <div2 n="CHEAP JOURNALISM" type="subchapter" id="s10"> <head>CHEAP JOURNALISM.</head>

  <p>And the above consideration brings me once again
to the subject of cheap journalism. The abolition
of stamps on advertisements and the paper duty no
doubt paved the way to the success of our lowpriced daily periodicals.  We can give more for
the money than of yore, and the School Board has
sent us a sufficiency of readers. And this sufficiency
is enough to supply the demand of all the proprietors.
<hi rend="italic">The Daily Mail, The Morning Leader</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The
Morning Herald</hi> have their supporters, without
trenching on the ground occupied by <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">Post, Telegraph, News, Chronicle, Standard</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Advertiser.</hi> The more the merrier. And here I
must refer to that marvel of cheapness, <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's
Weekly Newspaper</hi>, a publication that has been
admirably conducted for half a century. I have to
thank its proprietors for allowing me to reproduce
some of my writings in its columns anent Parliament.
Papers increase in numbers, and paper readers keep
pace with the production. So an enterviewed
publisher told me the other day, and I believed him.</p>
</div2>
         <div2 n="THE PRESS AS A PROFESSION" type="subchapter" id="s11"><head>THE PRESS AS A PROFESSION.</head>

  <p>Looking at the condition of writers for the Press
in London at the end of the century, a Press man

<pb id="p.13" n="13"/>





can feel only satisfaction. Forty or fifty years ago
the saying went that <q>journalism was good for a
walking-stick, but not as a crutch.</q> A man was a
barrister first and a journalist afterwards. Leader
writing and reviewing paid the rent of chambers,
while Briefless was waiting to prove his surname to be
a misnomer. But you find the gentlemen of the long
robe who have embraced journalism as a profession,
keeping their names up in Lincoln's Inn and the
Temple to avoid serving on juries, and not with any
serious intention of obtaining clients amongst
solicitors. And as for the tone of the Press, it is
beyond reproach.   A  short while since  certain
accusations were made against newspaper writers that
they preferred pecuniary profit to professional honour.
The matter was taken up by a sub-committee of the
London District of the Institute of Journalists, with
the gratifying result that not a single member of the
Institute could be found to have betrayed his trust.
For it is a trust that the journalists hold. They are
the guardians of the nation's honour. One is not
expected to be very serious while compiling <q>a book
of gossip,</q> but yet I cannot refrain from expressing
my delight that my father was a journalist, and that
I have followed the same calling. There is nothing
in the condition of London journalism at the close
of the century which stultifies the time-honoured title
of <q> gentlemen of the Press.</q></p></div2></div1>

where all religious functions connected with the

Before this place of worship was established the
building was used for Burford's Panorama. To this
day, those who remember the pictures of Switzerland
can trace the ancient form. Where once was seen
the Lake of Lucerne, now stands an altar, and the
summit of the Righi is replaced by the portrait of a
saint. Within a dozen yards of the church is the
Empire, which, when it was first opened, also contained a panorama.  Under the superintendence of
the late Alfred Thompson a realistic representation
of the battle of Balaclava was shown. In the foreground were some dummy lancers and broken drums.
On one occasion the effect was somewhat spoiled by
an old gentleman, one of the public, who had paid
his shilling for admission, getting over the barrier to
search for his dropped umbrella amongst the warlike
debris.</p></div2>

the Marseillaise and to hoot the Wacht am Rhein.
Only a short while ago, at the commencement of our

to sing <q>Rule Britannia.</q>  In <date value="1871">1871</date> I remember

In spite of the fine new roads piercing the slums of
Soho, the humbler portion of the French colony still
haunts the well-beloved locality. But the Gauls do
not have it all their own way. For their neighbours
they have a strong Swiss contingent, and even a
detachment from the main body of Italians occupying Hatton Garden. As for the aristocracy of the

in Britons of the same class dwelling in <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName> and

  <p>But there is one race of men born outside Britain
which we Englishmen can never regard as aliens.
They are of the same blood as ourselves, and for a
thousand years had the same history.  When a
foreigner ventures to put up for a West End club he
must personally be very popular to secure the faintest
chance of election. When a citizen of the United
States seeks admission, his nationality is a recommendation. The Garrick, the Beefsteak, the Union
and the Wyndham are full of our American cousins,
and if they are seldom found in the Carlton or the
Reform, it is because participation in national politics
at those clubs is a necessary qualification.  At the
recent banquet in honour of Her Majesty's eightieth
birthday, our American cousins took a part as representatives of England's senior colony. Not long ago
I had the pleasure of conversing with Mr. Maxim, of
quick-firing fame. When we discussed the relative


<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>




positions of England and the United States, I ventured to tell him that I considered his part of the
territory on the other side of the Atlantic was a
branch establishment of the Mother Country, of
which she had every reason to be proud. Mr. Maxim
agreed with me. One of the pleasantest signs of
the times at the end of the centruy is the hearty
good-feeling that happily exists between the two
great divisions of the English-speaking race.</p></div2>

   <p>Years ago cattle-show week was an institution of
far greater importance than it is at the present
moment.   The week in which it was held was
considered by the theatrical proprietor and the lessees
of the music halls as the carnival of the country
cousin. Even at the close of the century, a large
contingent of rosy-cheeked young men, wearing pot
hats and leather gaiters, visit London at the end of
October and in early November. But, thanks to the
railways and their cheap excursions, provincials have
grown so accustomed to our manners and customs
that they nowadays attract little attention.  The
country bumpkin of old-fashioned melodrama is
played out, at any rate, in the metropolis. Of late
years nearly every county has its London dinner,
whereat all the provincials settled in town enjoy a

<pb id="p.19" n="19"/>









banquet and eloquence of a more or less excellent
order. We have the festival of the Devonians in
London, and the East Anglians in London, and
many others. Taking the journalists belonging to
the metropolitan district of the Institute, I believe
country is in the majority to town. Indeed, it has
occurred to me that if I wished to establish my name
as an organizer, I could adopt no better course than
founding a dinner to be exclusively reserved for
Londoners in London. I believe that if I were to
make the attempt, my chief difficulty would be to
find sufficient <foreign lang="FR">convives</foreign> possessing the necessary
qualification. Until a provincial speaks it is difficult
to distinguish him from a Londoner, but when he
talks his accent betrays him. Strictly speaking, your
true Londoner should be born within sound of Bow
Bells, but this test will remain obsolete until the
belfry of the famous City church has been sufficiently
repaired to allow of the ringing of the chimes.</p></div2>

the fog, in <placeName key="North End">North End</placeName>, Fulham, but a recent map
of the locality which contained the house in which
I was born, proves to me that there was a mistake

<pb id="p.20" n="20"/>


 in the matter.  According to this chart, I
must have commenced the earliest days of my
career in West Kensington.  What were Brompton
and Hammersmith 20 or 30 years ago, are now really
the south-western portion of the London postal district. But this matters little to our visitors. To them
Town is always Town. Go where you will, you find the
provincials all the year round, and besides them,
colonists from Canada, Australia, and Southern Africa.
They are mostly white, but India and the Gold Coast
send us many swarthy fellow subjects. These last
are to be found in large numbers at the Inns of Court.
They chiefly adopt the <placeName key="Inner Temple">Inner Temple</placeName>, but some of

  <p>In conclusion, taking the stranger in London as

our assumption, that given health, plenty of money,
and a cheerful disposition, he has a thoroughly good
time of it.</p></div2></div1>

<p>PERHAPS nothing strikes a Londoner with greater
force than the altered tone about the manner of spending Sunday in town which marks the end of the century. It was Charles <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> who first called attention to the dismal view that some very worthy people
adopted relative to what they were pleased to call
<q> the Sabbath.</q> London, in spite of its vast population, is distinctly <q>religious.</q> I use the word in its
broadest sense. We have little of that <q> philosophy </q>
which in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> means <q> infidelity.</q> Certainly here and
there we find a <foreign lang="FR">poseur</foreign> who delights in proclaiming
his contempt for things divine, but the bulk of sensible
men regard him with as much esteem as that accorded
to the gentleman who took pleasure in speaking disrespectfully of the Equator. A stroll through the
streets between twelve and one on a Sunday will
show the promenader all sorts and conditions of

<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>



men coming from church and chapel. And if the
afternoon and evening are spent in recreation away
from the tavern, why none should be the worse.
After all, it is only reverting to the eighteenth
century, when many a country parson took part in
a game of cricket on the village green. So, without
entering into the vexed question of sacred music (or
otherwise) in our halls and public buildings, I will
give a rapid glance at Sunday as we find it in London
at the end of the nineteenth century.</p></div2>


        <div2 n="THE FOUNDERS OF THE ORATORIO" type="subchapter" id="s20"><head>THE FOUNDERS OF THE ORATORIO.</head>

  <p>The reference to music on the first day of the week
brings me naturally to that product of the followers
of St. Philip Neri, the oratorio. The good Italian
priest founded his oratory in Florence centuries ago,
and, thanks to Cardinal Newman and Father Faber,
branch establishments have appeared in Birmingham
and London since <date value="1850">1850</date>. To the casual Londoner the
Brompton Oratory is a magnificent church used
frequently during the season for-as the papers have
it-<q> fashionable  weddings.</q>  But the  excellent
Fathers have duties other than presiding at nuptials
of the blue blood of Catholic Society. The Fathers
have <q>Little Brothers,</q> who, on the first day of the
week, meet together for pleasant chat and chess and
other innocent distractions. On the Feast of St.
<pb id="p.23" n="23"/>





Cecilia there is an oratorio held in their own private
chapel, at which the best music is performed, to the
delight of the audience, or should I say-for a sermon
is a part of the proceedings-the congregation ? What
that excellent institution the Y.M.C.A. is to non-Catholics the Little Brothers of the Oratory are to members
of the Church of Rome. And here I may call attention to the change of tone that has taken place during
the last thirty years anent the question of <q>'Version.</q>
I have in my mind as I write the case of a youngster
of sixteen, whose religious belief altered in the early
sixties. His career had been marked out for him.
A great friend of his dead father was a titled
stock-broker, who had most kindly promised the lad a
seat in his counting-house with a junior partnership in
the future. The moment the news reached the City
that the boy had 'Verted the kind offer was withdrawn.
The elder brother of the youngster suggested as a
mode of <q> knocking the nonsense </q> out of him, turning
him into the workhouse, and, as a matter of fact, penniless and without food, the young gentleman had to
seek a breakfast, the outcome of hospitable benevolence. At the end of this century such a case would
be impossible. Now-a-days a religious belief is regarded with as much tolerance as opinions anent
politics. A man is allowed to follow the teachings of
the Archbishop of Canterbury, or Cardinal Vaughan,
or Dr. Parker, or the Rev. Price Hughes, as the spirit

<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>









moves him. So long as he is a good fellow, which
is another term for a gentleman in its right sense,
it matters little to the vast majority whether he be
Anglican, Catholic, or Dissenter. The old feeling
of hatred and all uncharitableness which, perhaps,
was a legacy from the times of the Puritans, and later
on the Jacobites, has disappeared, and London is
the better for it.</p></div2>


            <div2 n="LONDON CHURCHGOERS" type="subchapter" id="s21"> <head>LONDON CHURCHGOERS.</head>

  <p>In spite of the exceptions to whom I have referred
the bulk of Londoners are churchgoers. In the country for years it has been considered the thing to do to
go to the family pew, as an example to the simple
villagers. Besides, the Rector would feel naturally
annoyed if the Squire were absent. The meetings at
the Sessions, the dinner-table, and even, perhaps, the
covertside, would be slightly embarrassing if the Hall
neglected the Pulpit's sermons. And what has been
long the rule in the country has become the custom
in town. There are very few churches west of the
site of <placeName key="Temple Bar">Temple Bar</placeName> that have not crowded congregations. Many of the temples of the Establishment
have as many services as the Catholic churches and
chapels, and at each service (especially at the Catholic) in the morning there is a new set of worshippers.
From statistics it would seem that the influence of

<pb id="p.25" n="25"/>



the Church is holding its own. Every day amongst
the intellectual there is a call. Without becoming
serious people are more and more in earnest. It was
no mean compliment to a land where a church is by
law established that a Pope should testify to the
national righteousness, and yet so it has been. There
is a spirit of conciliation abroad, in spite of differences
of opinion upon such weighty matters as the burning
of incense and the use of daylight candles.</p>
</div2>

              <div2 n="RELIGIOUS ARMIES" type="subchapter" id="s22"><head>RELIGIOUS <q>ARMIES.</q></head>

  <p>The end of the century sees in existence two wonderful organisations-the Church Army and the Salvation Army. It has been the fashion to laugh at the
latter and <q>the General</q> who commands it. Now
and again I have come across some of his officers, and
certainly, from what I have gathered from them, I
cannot speak of the movement with disrespect. No
doubt the music of the Salvationists in the streets is
not always tuneful, and, to put it quite straight,
frequently a nuisance.  And there may be a lurking danger that the excitement created by long
prayer meetings may lead to lunacy, as it did, I have
been told, amongst the revivalists in America. But
taking the Salvation Army as a whole, I believe that
it has been the cause of a maximum of good and a
minimum of evil. And I say this as a Christian who

<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>



belongs to a creed which differs materially with the
tenets held by the General.</p>
  <p>And here I may point out that the Salvation Army
is no new thing. Those who have read Macaulay's
essays dealing with the Reformation will find that the
preaching monk was quite as much in earnest as the
Fire and Iron captain.

     <div2 n="TWO LEADERS OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT" type="subchapter" id="s23"><head>TWO LEADERS OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT.</head>

  <p>In <q>a book of gossip</q> it may appear out of place
to take a sedate view of life, and life in London on a
Sunday is at its sedatest. So I will touch very lightly
upon what is known as the Nonconformist Conscience.
It has been my good fortune to come across a large
number of divines, from Cardinal Manning at one
end of the list to the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon at the
other. I take these two good and great men because
they have left us, and the language of eulogy is saved
the possible reproach of being flattery by the sad
barrier of the grave.</p>
  <p>The first time I met Cardinal Manning was when
he was living at York Place, and then was an archbishop and not a member of the Sacred College. I
had come to him at the request of the proprietor of
a paper to see if he would purchase the copyright. I
shall never forget the interview. Dr. Manning was
kindness itself, and, in spite of the natural inclination

<pb id="p.27" n="27"/>



to chaff a lad-I was little more than a lad in those
days-who had come upon an absurd errand, refrained
from the temptation. My paper was devoted to the
Turf in a great degree, and yet it was my duty in the
interests of the needy proprietor to show a way to
utilising it as a so-called <q> religious</q> journal. I suggested to His Eminence (that was to be) that to the
races might be added <q> sermons.</q> <q> My dear young
friend,</q> said Dr. Manning with a smile, <q> does it not
seem to you that there is something slightly incongruous in the juxtaposition of Latest Sporting with
Latest Ecclesiastical ?</q></p>
  <p>And there did.</p>
  <p>Many a time afterwards I met Cardinal Manning,
and he not unfrequently referred to the occasion when
I tried to induce him to become the proprietor of the
<hi rend="italic">Glowworm</hi>. He was one of the kindest and best of
men.</p>
  <p>Both Cardinal Manning and Mr. Spurgeon were
very fond of a joke. The last time I saw the latter
was on a Sunday some months before his death, when
I was induced, in company with a High Church Anglican clergyman, to pay a visit to the Tabernacle to
hear the reverend gentleman preach. We found the
place crowded, and, at the suggestion of one of the
attendants, tried our luck at a door in the rear of the
premises. We found that we had come upon the private entrance reserved for pastors. Our names were

<pb id="p.28" n="28"/>









taken in to Mr. Spurgeon, who was conducting the service. He came out and gave us both a hearty welcome. In the course of a few minutes we found ourselves seated on a sofa in the pulpit. A gentleman
was reading out the verse of a hymn, and when he had
finished he turned round to us and courteously invited
us to lead the singing. This was slightly embarrassing to my clerical friend, because his costume was
markedly ecclesiastical, and to me because my voice
is not very strong and has never been exhaustively
cultivated. Besides, I was not quite certain that the
sentiment of the hymn had, from a purely theological
point of view, my whole-hearted approval. However,
the congregation, which numbered some thousands,
managed, so far as we were able to judge, to get on
very comfortably without our assistance. After the
hymn came Mr. Spurgeon's address, which was full of
light and shade, by turns witty and solemn, and always
interesting. We had a short chat with Mr. Spurgeon
after the service was over, when the genial pastor suggested to my High Church friend that, although it
would be scarcely fair for him in any of his discourses
to adopt any of his jokes, he was quite at liberty to
use his controversial arguments.</p></div2>

           <div2 n="THE POSITION OF THE JEWS" type="subchapter" id="s24"><head>THE POSITION OF THE JEWS.</head>
  <p>As I am referring particularly to leaders of religious
thought in this chapter, it may not be out of place at

<pb id="p.29" n="29"/>


this point to make a passing allusion to the position
held by the Jews at the close of the century in the
estimation of their fellow Londoners. Thanks to their
kindness of heart to their countrymen of British
nationality and their patriotism, they have long since
ceased to be regarded as a race apart. <q>The Merchant of Venice,</q> which in the last century was regarded as a comedy, so far as the principal character
was concerned, at the present time is accepted in the
same relationship as a tragedy. The wrongs of Shylock are no longer received with shouts of derisive
laughter, but even with tears, and when Sir Henry
Irving quits the stage in his gaberdine, bowed down
with the cruel insults of the victorious Christian, the
exit is greeted with keenly sympathetic applause.
It seems strange to us nowadays that the Jews should
have been forbidden entrance to the House of Commons, when some of the most respected members of
the House of Lords at this moment belong to the
same persuasion. At the clubs there are now no religious disabilities, and some of our most popular chief
magistrates in the City have been supporters of the
synagogues. Some of our greatest philanthropists
have also been Jews, and one of the soundest lawyers
of modern times, a Hebrew by birth and faith, added
by his honoured presence to the illustrious traditions
of the British judicial bench.</p></div2></div1>

<p>SINCE <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> wrote of Mr. and Mrs. Crummles and
their interesting company the position of the actor
has greatly improved. According to the statute, not
so very many years ago, the player was a rogue and
a vagabond. Nowadays a famous tragedian or comedian may expect a knighthood as a proper recognition of his services in the cause of art. Not only this,
the stage is becoming one of the professions. Young
men from the universities find the A.D.C. and the
O.U.D.C. stepping stones to the boards of the London theatres. No longer is the adoption of the mask

in the early part of the century were described on the
programmes as <q>esquires,</q> now appear without their
titles. The Church and the Stage have joined hands,
and both claim the right of delivering sermons. In
a word, play-acting has become, in the eyes of the
right minded, absolutely respectable. This is as it
should be. It seems to me that if one day of the
week is given up to the pulpit, there can be no possible harm in devoting the other six to instruction
more or less combined with amusement. It is a solid
fact that, at length, London has playhouses in numbers bearing some proportion to the total of its inhabitants. Within the last eighteen months not only
have theatres sprung into being in the heart of the
metropolis, but in almost every suburb included in the
postal district. And, taken all round, the entertainment provided has been of first-rate quality. The
work of the Lord Chamberlain's Examiner has not
been unpleasant. The public may be tired of <q>problems,</q> but they act as their own censors and will not
tolerate pieces defying official condemnation. Even
<q>the <hi rend="italic">jeunesse</hi> stage doory</q> has become a memory

and have no leisure to accept the graceful hospitality
of the actor-managers. The actor of to-day receives
his applause as does the eminent Q.C. who listens
to the appreciation of his colleagues in the robing
room.   The liberty of the Press is unthreatened,
for it is clearly understood that there is a hard and
fast line dividing friendship from duty. A critic is a
judge first and a <hi rend="italic">bon camarade</hi> afterwards. This is
a novel situation for the end of the century. This
foregathering of friends lays that spirit of spite that
disfigured so many of the <hi rend="italic">critiques</hi> of the forties and
fifties. Charles Kean-Etonian and man of culture-suffered
severely from this malevolence. It was the

<pb id="p.33" n="33"/>




order of the day in more than one office to slate the
tragedian with the <q> snuffle </q> and the <q> nose of strange
device.</q> But nowadays a critic would as soon think
of criticising unfairly, unjustly, the rhetoric of the
Royal Courts of Justice as the elocution of our leading theatres. I think Sir Henry Irving has written of
the typical actor as <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>, and claimed indulgence
for that unrespected puppet. But his remarks referred to the days when Punch was found at the
corner of the streets. Nowadays both the dramatic
and the literary puppet are absolutely respectable,
and both wear well-fitting evening suits inclusive of
spotless white waistcoats.</p></div2>


           <div2 n="PLAYHOUSES, OLD AND NEW" type="subchapter" id="s27"><head>PLAYHOUSES, OLD AND NEW.</head>

  <p>Looking at the list of theatres at the end of the
century it is instructive to note that most of the senior
playhouses have retained the speciality of fifty years
ago. The Lyceum is still the home of romantic
drama, Drury Lane and the Adelphi of melodrama,
the St. James and the Haymarket of comedy. The
merry little Strand with its memories of <persName key="Byron, George Gordon">Byron</persName> and
Burnand, and, earlier still, of Talford and Albert
Smith, is rather uncertain in the tone of its entertainment.
Of the new theatres three or four are
given over to the charms of what of old was known
as the burletta.  It is strange that with so many


<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>



musical pieces going in all directions a national opera
cannot be established. But so it is. Professor Stanford has recently appealed to the public and the
County Council to subsidise such an institution, but
hitherto without success.  The days of Pyne and
Harrison are over, and Carl Rosa is becoming a
memory of the past.</p>
  <p><placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName> survives as the solitary opera house.
The home of music where <persName key="Lind, Jenny">Jenny Lind</persName> made her London debut, and Sims Reeves sang in English, no
longer exists. Her Majesty's is now a theatre, not an
opera house. On the 24th of May, <date value="1899">1899</date>, however,
the <persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName> on her eightieth birthday heard the
national anthem sung on the site of the boards where
Piccolomini warbled the death melodies of <q>La
Traviata.</q> I believe I may take the credit of filling
the theatre, on the occasion to which I refer, with the
children of the State. The scholars of the Duke of
York's School and the Greenwich Hospital School
were there, with many others.  At half-past two
o'clock the children wished their <persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName> many happy
returns of the day, and Her Majesty listened to the
greeting at Windsor.  The telephone carried the
voices from the theatre to the Castle. I believe that
it was the first time that a monarch had listened to
an address from her subjects at a distance of forty
miles.</p></div2>

  <div2 n="PROGRESS BEFORE AND BEHIND THE CURTAIN" type="subchapter" id="s28"><head>PROGRESS BEFORE AND BEHIND THE CURTAIN.</head>

  <p>At the end of the century the insurance companies
might well lessen their charges for playhouses, as
theatres are infinitely safer than they were only a
decade ago. The substitution of the electric light
for gas and the regulations of the Lord Chamberlain's Office may have had something to do with this
welcome change. Looking through the papers in
<dateRange from="1899" to="1900">1899-1900</dateRange> one seldom reads of a temple of the drama
destroyed by fire. Not so long ago it was a standing
line of the contents bill. The new theatres are so
built that they are isolated. The Shaftesbury, for
instance, has a road on every side, and like precautions are being taken in the theatres now in course of
construction. Besides this, the new century sees
improvements on either side of <q>the rag,</q> or to give it
its full dress title, the proscenium  curtain.  The
luxurious lounges of the stalls nowadays find their
way into the pit and even into the front rows of the
gallery. The marble of the restaurants invades the
auditoriums of the theatres. Behind the scenes the
arrangements are excellent. Stages can be sunk and
all sorts of new contrivances lessen the labour of the
carpenters. The dressing rooms of the company, that
a score of years ago would have been a disgrace as
box rooms of fifth-rate charity schools, now have


<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>




many of the comforts of the best hotels. Even the
greenroom is brighter and in better taste than it was
in the days of yore. Now that authors (following
the precedent set by Dion Boucicault and Tom
Robertson) have become their own stage managers,
there is less of the <q> My dearing </q> that used to shock
the susceptibilities of novices transferred to Bohemia
from Mayfair. The familiarity that breeds contempt
has all but disappeared, and the talk at a rehearsal is
not unlike the conversation of a drawing room in
common form.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the earnings have improved all round.
The author gets heavier fees, and the proprietor finds
no difficulty in working at a profit. Less than fifty
years ago theatrical property spelt want if not bankruptcy. Webster, Buckstone and Vining died in poor
circumstances.  Then Sir Squire Bancroft and his
clever wife, who will always be remembered by old
play-goers as Marie Wilton, seemed to break the
spell. The Bancrofts were succeeded by the
Kendals and John Hare.     Then  Sir Augustus
Harris did very well.  Of late years nearly all
theatres have been open and thriving.  Whether
the actor's calling is always to be desired is subject
to debate. Not long ago I met an old friend who

<pb id="p.37" n="37"/>




before adopting the stage as a profession had served
in the army. He had been a good-looking fellow
with the manners of a gentleman. With these recommendations to back him he had been engaged over
and over again for <q>juvenile lead.</q></p>
  <p><q> What do you think of the stage as a profession ?</q>
I asked.</p>
  <p><q>It would be well enough if it were not for the
<quote>'resting.'</quote> Here have I been out of an engagement for
two years. I may go home to night and find an engagement open to me, giving me ten or fifteen pounds
a week for a twelvemonth. But then I may not. I
may have to continue indefinitely resting.</q></p>
  <p><q>Then you don't consider the stage lucrative? </q></p>
  <p><q> On the whole, I think, from a financial point of
view, sweeping a crossing is safer.  But then, of
course, play-acting is very often pleasanter.</q></p>
  <p>And the speaker was a man who held a foremost
place in the ranks of the profession.</p></div2>

<p>BECAUSE someone called the House of Commons, in
a moment of inspiration, <q>the best club in London,</q>
the idea has gone abroad that the life of the representative of the people is one of luxurious ease. The fact that a seat in Parliament never (or scarcely ever)
goes a-begging, has no doubt done much to confirm
the impression.  There is a magic in the letters
<q> M.P.</q> that is particularly attractive to a vast number
of men. To a barrister in good practice with an
ambition to change the wig of the advocate for the
tonsured coiffure of the judge, the position is
necessary. As no Lord Mayor of London can occupy
the Mansion House without having served the office
of Sheriff, so a Q.C. must have worked for his party
before he can hope for the chief seat on the Bench.
Of course, he may not have succeeded in passing the
bar protected by the Serjeant-at-Arms, but at any

<pb id="p.39" n="39"/>



rate, he must have made the attempt. In such a
case as this he will find promotion in India or the
Colonies, if there be no available appointment in the
Mother Country.   Then, of course, a Member of
Parliament has special claims to the attention of the
company promoter. A board of directors can never
be considered perfect unless one or two of its members
can carry the glamour of the House into the homes
of the readers of prospectuses. But, after all, those
who materially benefit from their position in St.
Stephen's are comparatively few. The vast majority
of the chosen of the electors enter the House for
<q>the honour and glory of the thing.</q> It may be
well to show the seamy side of the picture, and prove
(as an Irish member might observe) that even those
of the colleagues of Sir Wilfrid Lawson who do not
share that hon. baronet's objection to stimulants, are
presumably unable to obtain <q> cakes and ale</q>; in
short, the <q> luxurious ease </q> of rumour may be translated into the <q>terribly hard work</q> of fact.</p></div2>


          <div2 n="THE WORK OF THE HOUSE" type="subchapter" id="s31"><head>THE WORK OF THE HOUSE.</head>

  <p><q>Idle! </q> exclaimed an hon. friend of mine who had
been a member in a couple of Parliaments; <q>I only
wish I could be, but the whips and my constituents
keep me well to my work. Unless I gave satisfaction
to both I should not retain my seat at the next

<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>



election.</q> I suggested that since the establishment of
the close at midnight rule, the labour of our legislators
was less than of old. <q> Not at all,</q> was his reply.
<q>We do not (except on occasions) keep such late
hours as we used to do, but then there is a great deal
more to be done outside the House, in the committee
rooms. No, take my word for it, there is no busier
man in the world than a Member of Parliament
desirous of retaining the confidence of his constituents. Of course, if he does not intend standing
at the next election, he can take it easily, but in that
case he must be prepared to run the gauntlet. On
the whole, it would be better to secure the stewardship of the <quote>'Chiltern Hundreds,'</quote> rather than challenge
the criticism of the party and his particular portion of
the electorate.</q></p>
</div2>

           <div2 n="A MEMBER'S MORNING" type="subchapter" id="s32"> <head>A MEMBER'S MORNING.</head>

  <p>Further conversation suggested to me the idea of
putting myself (in my mind's eye) in his place. I
assume that I am a Member of Parliament resident
in London at the end of the century.</p>
  <p>It is eight in the morning, and I have to get
through my duties. I glance at the Orders in the
newspapers to see if there is anything in them of
particular interest to my constituents. If there is, I
must make it a point to be in my place ready to

<pb id="p.41" n="41"/>



speak, if I can but <q> catch the Speaker's eye.</q> And
here I may remark that the operation is not so simple
as it sounds. I have known it require hints to the
whips and chats with the first commoner himself.
If you desire to address the House you must let your
wish be known. The task of selection rests with the
occupant of the chair, but his decisions are greatly
influenced by the advice of the organizers of the
contending parties, and the personal qualifications of
the would-be  orator.  If the oration  concerns
questions of a technical character, a specialist will
be considered to have special claims on the attention
of the House. The evidence of experts is always held
in reverence at St. Stephen's, but it may be days
before a private member can obtain his opportunity.
A friend of mine, although supported by the influence
of the whips and the good will of the Speaker, had
to wait on one occasion through four sittings before
his time arrived. He had to be continually in his
place on the chance of the chapter of accidents
giving him an earlier hearing. At the fourth sitting
it was intimated to him that Mr. Speaker considered
that he had deserved well of his constituents, and
earned his reward; this confession was followed
shortly afterwards by the eagerly anticipated capture
of the eye. And then he was able to air his eloquence
in the presence of a house thinned by the dinner hour.</p></div2>

          <div2 n="AN  M.P.'S CORRESPONDENCE" type="subchapter" id="s33"><head>AN  M.P.'S CORRESPONDENCE.</head>

  <p>I will assume that I am fairly free for this day, at
least.  I have no measure associated particularly
with my name <q>on the carpet,</q> and have only my
ordinary correspondence. If my constituency is an
important one, I have some fifty or a hundred letters
to answer daily. If my division is obscure, I shall
still have about a dozen, and each of these epistles
must be read and studied and carefully answered.
If I had any claims to the title of a <q> public man,</q>
I must have a private secretary to assist me. But
in this event I must use discretion. My other self
must only reply to comparative outsiders. If I instruct him to answer the wrong people, I may get
myself into trouble.   Constituents  are  usually
<q>touchy,</q> and the reputation for the lack of courtesy
is frequently the precursor of a sad dearth of votes.
Then I must consider the advisability of using <q> House
paper,</q> in lieu of my own. If my correspondent is in
any sense a personal friend, it is better to reply from
my private address. If he who writes is only a casual
acquaintance or one of the public, I should let my
note be headed with <q> House of Commons</q> in embossed characters; the latter superscription conveys
the impression that the writer is, so to speak, tied
chronically by the leg to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</p>
  <p>I find that my <q>answers to correspondents</q> take,

<pb id="p.43" n="43"/>



at the very least, a couple of hours, and now I have
to fix in my social engagements.</p>
  <p>I assume that as a speaker in the House I have
been a failure, and am, therefore, not much in request
at public meetings.  Under such circumstances, I
shall be free to attend committees, and I may be sure
that my availability (if I may be permitted to use
the word) will not be ignored by those in authority.</p></div2>

          <div2 n="IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM" type="subchapter" id="s34"><head>IN  THE COMMITTEE ROOM.</head>

  <p>The House opens for the reception of the
People's representatives at an early hour in the
morning, and many members take their breakfast in the coffee-room.  No doubt I shall have
discussed the matutinal meal at home, so that I have
only to drop into the library or the smoking-room.
In these two apartments I shall find any number of
my colleagues acting (with the assistance of the
stamped stationery) as the living encyclopaedias of
their constituents. Having got through my
letter-writing before leaving home, I shall only have to find
my way to that committee room in which it will be
my fate to breathe until I am released by the chairman
at four o'clock to give my services in another place.
Most of the committee chambers run on the upper
floor along the river front, but since the removal of
the Law Courts from <placeName key="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</placeName> to the Strand,

<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>



there are also apartments devoted to the consideration of Private Bills, besides the <q> big room of Rufus.</q></p>
<p>It is in the councils appointed by the House that
a member really works. Every M.P. is obliged to
belong to one or more committees.    His only
escape is to be a Member of the Government, and
then he will not avoid being appointed to the chairmanship of some special committee or other. The
ordinary member during the Session serves, on the
average, four days a week on these councils. If he
shirks his work, he is reported to the Speaker, and
then there are what the French call <q>Reclamations.</q></p>
  <p>As important interests are at stake, five form a
quorum for a private committee, and if that number
is not maintained, the expense incurred by those
interested, of course, goes for nothing; so it stands
to reason that unless the appointed committee men
keep a house, there must be a good deal of outside
discontent, and outside discontent is the one thing
that representatives of the people regard with genuine
apprehension.  Once in a committee room, the
member is bound to stay, as he acts for the day as
one of the judges whose duty it is to inquire into
the merits or demerits of the scheme undergoing
investigation. In some cases there is absolute hardship, as refreshments are not allowed to be served
in the rooms during the holdings of certain committees. In cases such as these, the fate of the

<pb id="p.45" n="45"/>









member is not unlike that of the jury locked in to
consider a difficult verdict.  He must neither eat
nor drink till he has done his duty.  Besides the
Private  Bill Committees, there are the  Grand
Committees of Law and Trade, to which nearly everyone belongs. In these assemblies 40 form a quorum.
(The number required, too, for keeping a house).</p>
  <p>In special committees every constituent is expected
to question the witnesses, and, therefore, has to be
up in its subjects. If by chance the member should
be chairman, then he has to be the chief inquisitor.
However, the secretary (one of the clerks of the
House) will do his best to get a proof from which
the witness can be examined. Sometimes, when a
committee is ordered which is expected to be popular
<q> outside,</q> there is quite a rush for places, and then
those responsible for its selection have to use a great
deal of tact and discrimination. The proceedings of
such a committee are reported to the newspapers,
and the member consequently obtains the honour
and glory of unlimited publicity.  But the vast
majority of councils do their work in silence and
neglect, and seldom are rendered famous by the
conductors of the Press.</p>
</div2>
            <div2 n="WHO GOES HOME?" type="subchapter" id="s35"><head><q>WHO GOES HOME?</q></head>
  <p>I will take for granted that until three or four
o'clock I have nobly performed my duty in the

<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>



committee rooms, and am now at liberty to occupy
my customary seat in the House. For hours I still
sit patiently waiting my opportunity to speak or to
vote. Very frequently I shall receive a summons
in the outer lobby. A card will have been sent to
me (it usually takes about three-quarters of an hour
to get from the hands of the sender to those of its
intended recipient) requesting my attendance without.
A police constable will assist me in the discovery of
my visitor. As a country member I shall be less
troubled than if I represented a London division. It
is on record that, during a single night's sitting, a
metropolitan M.P. was <q>called for</q> no less than
eighty times by the electors who had assisted at his
triumph. The hours will crawl on until the hands of
the clock point to midnight; then, asked by the
attendants the question, <q>Who goes home?</q> I shall
retire to my dwelling (humble or otherwise) and rest
until the new day brings with it fresh labours.</p>
  <p>And having written thus far, I feel that I have
scarcely done full justice to my theme; there are
scores of other duties that have escaped me that a
representative has to perform. To be popular, he
must have the strength of a giant, the intelligence of
a sage, and the patience and kind-heartedness of a
saint.</p></div2></div1>

<p>A LITTLE before three o'clock a couple of attendants
stroll in to see that all is in order. Two large prayer
books are placed on the table, and a couple of
foot-stools appear before them. These aids to devotion
are for the use of the Speaker and the Chaplain.
Some dozen members-more or less-take up their
places on the comfortable green leathered lounges
that appear on either side of the canopied chair
reserved for the use of the first commoner in England.
The Reporters' Gallery is vacant, because strangers
are not admitted until prayers are over. It is presumed that M.P.'s prefer to pray for themselves, and
resent assistance from without. The Ladies' Gallery
is filled with occupants, dimly seen through the bars
that were placed in position many years ago to keep
wives from threatening their titular lords and masters.
As Big Ben strikes three, Mr. Speaker and the

<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>



Chaplain enter in procession, and the former stands
in front of his chair, with the latter to the left of
him.  The members present remove their hats, stand
up, and turn with their faces to the wall.  Then, at
the invitation of Mr. Speaker, the Chaplain reads
three prayers-two of them (those for Her Majesty
and the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the rest of
the Royal Family) are in the Book of Common Prayer-
and the third is special to the place and the
occasion.  The legislators give up some five minutes
to their devotions, and then the members face about,
sit down, and resume their hats, while the Chaplain
retires gracefully, saluting the Speaker as he backs
into the lobby.</p></div2>



<div2 n="AFTER PRAYERS" type="subchapter" id="s37"><head>AFTER PRAYERS</head>

	<p>The clerks in their wigs and gowns take their places
at the table, from which the huge tomes have been
removed.  The Speaker mounts his throne, and the
Serjeant-at-Arms places the mace in postion, opposite
the clerks, and divided fromthem by works of
reference and a three-minutes' hour-glass.  The clock
under the Strangers' Gallery marks a quarter past
three,  and the <q>private business</q> is disposed of.  At
this moment the House seems to be, so to speak, in
its dressing-gown or morning-slippers.  Certainly,
Mr. Speaker is as dignified as ever, but the front bench

<pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

on his right, reserved later for Ministers, is occupied
by all sorts and conditions of non-official members.
The Government is not particularly interested in
"private business," as a rule, and courtesy takes the
place of opposition.  About half an hour is devoted
to this kind of work, and then comes the formula of
presenting petitions.  The representation of a constituency
briefly describes the purport of the appealing
document with which he has been entrusted, and then
walks to either side of the table and drops it into an
open carpet bag of truly pantomimic dimensions.
The petition is taken as read.</p>

most amusing and sometimes instructive games of
the House-questioning and answering.  On the
unbound, unstitched sheets of paper containing the
programme of the business of the sitting, that each
member has received in entering, appears a number
of queries that have to be set at rest by the heads
of the Government.  One evening no less than eleven
pages out of sixteen were devoted to these interrogations.
They numbered eighty-one in all, and
seventeen Ministers were required to be in their
places to answer them, as the following table will

  <p>The figures are instructive of the condition of the
House of Commons at the end of the century.
They show that the Irish members ask about
double as many questions as their Scotch colleagues,
and that the Admiralty just now is attracting three
times as much attention as the War Office. It is

<pb id="p.51" n="51"/>



unnecessary to say that the interrogatories have,
during the hours of the morning, been worked
out in the various Government departments.  The
private secretaries of the Ministers are responsible
for their masters' enlightenment.  On the very
next evening the questions amounted to only a
couple of dozen, and a strange thing happened; only
one member appeared to act as interrogator of a
solitary demand, so twenty-three conundrums remained without solutions. Mr. Speaker goes through
the list twice, calling upon the member who has to
put the question by name. This proceeding affords
strangers an opportunity of being acquainted with
the personal characteristics of the representatives
of the people. The questions (which are asked by
merely mentioning their numbers) relate to all
subjects, from the building of an ironclad to the salary
of an Irish Government doorkeeper; from a lost
postage stamp to a matter of foreign policy of the
most vital importance. By about five o'clock the
question game is over, and then the House fills rapidly.</p>

  <p>As each member enters, he uncovers and bows to
the Speaker before taking his place, and the obeisance
is performed not in a perfunctory manner, but as if
the representative really respected the recipient of

<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>


his salutation.  Silk hats are the rule, and
wide-awakes the exception. Frock coats, cut-aways, sacks
and gaiters are the sartorial characteristics of the
chosen of the people. The Serjeant-at-Arms (occasionally
relieved by his assistant) sits to the right of
and in the rear of the bar of the House, facing the
Speaker.   He is garbed after the fashion of the
eighteenth century in sombre black cloth, with a
white scabbard, sword and steel hilt resting beside
him. Sometimes a member who is <q>a little late</q> in
entering the House converses with this imposing
official, and learns from him the latest parliamentary
news.   And now, all being in readiness, the most
showy work of the sitting commences in real earnest.
The ex-Ministers, sitting on the first bench to the
left of the Speaker's chair, attack the right hon.
gentlemen opposite. The subjects of the caricaturists
spar and fence, using now the rapier and now the
bludgeon. A <q>palpable hit</q> is followed by a roar
of <q>Hear, hears</q> from the one side or the other.
The Speaker rests back in his chair, with works of
reference and stationery on either side of him,
and looks steadily at the clock. The first commoner
is ready to interpose when necessary, but for the
moment has nothing better to do than to gaze at
the green baize board that shields him from the too
powerful glare flashing from the sunlight. The debate
is carried on with more or less vigour until about

<pb id="p.53" n="53"/>


eight, when there is an adjournment for some
half-hour for refreshment. Before this moment arrives
the sunshine had faded from the stained glass
windows, with their mottoes and devices, and the
shaded light of electricity has poured down from the
ceiling.
</p></div2>
        <div2 n="AFTER DINNER IN THE HOUSE" type="subchapter" id="s40"><head>AFTER DINNER IN THE HOUSE.</head>

  <p>On the resumption of <q>business,</q> members return,
some still in morning dress, and others in the regulation tail coats and white neckties of privileged
West End society. Now and again there is a division.
When this occurs there is a preliminary trial of
strength. The question is put from the chair, and the
<q>Ayes</q> shout out their approval. Then come the
<q> Noes.</q> <q>The <soCalled>ayes</soCalled>, I think, <soCalled>have it</soCalled>,</q> politely
suggests Mr. Speaker. <q>No, no,</q> shout those of the
contrary opinion. Then the hour-glass, which has
been resting between the mace and the clerks, is put
into requisition. The electric bells begin to ring all
over the House to summon back those who have
strayed away into the library, or the dining saloons
or the smoking rooms. Members flock in, and then
the door is closed by the Serjeant-at-Arms, who
guards it with his sheathed sword, more than ever in
evidence. Tellers are named by Mr. Speaker. The
members file out (<q>Ayes</q> to the right, <q>Noes</q> to the

<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>




left), to be counted. After a pause the doors are
thrown open by the Serjeant-at-Arms. The four
tellers advance in line, dressing from the right. They
halt as they reach the table and bow together, as they
hold in their hands two large sheets of paper. It
looks for a moment as if they purposed commencing
a glee for the special edification of Mr. Speaker.
But no; all they have to record is the result of the
recent division. This done, they bow again and
scatter. The debate is resumed, and the flow of talk,
sometimes vehement, sometimes terribly monotonous,
continues.  The silent members chat <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="IT">sotto voce</foreign></hi>
among themselves. Notabilities flit hither and thither.
Thus the proceedings continue hour by hour until
the hands of the clock approach midnight. At twelve
sharp comes the beginning of the end. No further
contentious business is allowed.  The Speaker,
assisted by his clerk at the table, puts certain orders
of the day. If no one objects, such a Bill is taken as
read a second time, and so on and so on. The list
is soon exhausted, and then the Speaker announces
the adjournment of the House, and leaves his chair.</p>
  <p>Stay, there is one more question. In the olden
days, when the people's representatives had to band
together to protect their lives and property from the
assaults of footpads and highwaymen, they used to
be called together by this last interrogatory. The
cry survives, although the occasion for its use has

<pb id="p.55" n="55"/>



passed away with the invention of gas and the establishment of the modern police force. <q>Who goes
home ? </q> shout the attendants. The reply is practically
given by the disappearance of everyone.</p></div2></div1>

       <div2 n="THE PREMIER CLUB OF ENGLAND." type="subchapter" id="s41"> <head>THE PREMIER CLUB OF ENGLAND.</head>

<p>IT may be well to consider whether the House of
Commons is <q> the best club in London.</q> The Palace
of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> has many points of resemblance to
the successors of the old coffee houses. You will find
in it <q>the very best people,</q> and some less eligible.
There is not a member who has not successfully
braved the terrors of the ballot box. It is true that
the election is, at most, for seven years, and not for
life. The more lengthy period is reserved for the
occupants of <q>another place</q>; but then they are
not chosen at all. Anyone can belong to the
Peers-it is only a question of birth. But a member of the
House of Commons has to be proposed, seconded,
and elected. He enters <q>the best club </q> backed by
a majority of votes. Under these circumstances, it
would not be wrong to say that, of the two chambers,
the lower is the more select.</p>

<pb id="p.57" n="57"/>




  <p><q>Yes, the House is fairly comfortable at the end
of the century,</q> said a friend of mine the other day.
<q>I have been in Parliament, as you know, for the
last twelve years, and think that to-day we can
certainly report progress. Herbert <persName key="Gladstone, Herbert">Gladstone</persName> during
his tenure of office worked wonders.</q></p>
  <p>This was said to me in the strangers' coffee room.
The apartment did not differ in appearance from the
saloons we are accustomed to in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName> or
<placeName key="St. James's Street">St. James's Street</placeName>. The tables were laid out for four.
Those nearest the windows, as usual, were most in
request. Through the glass panes a charming view
of the river could be obtained.</p>
  <p><q> Pretty, certainly,</q> replied the hon. legislator who
had been entertaining me, to my laudatory observation; <q>but St. Thomas's Hospital looks its best in the
sunlight. It is less pleasing when it is only dimly
visible in an approaching mist, and when we have a
fog, well, the prospect is not cheerful.</q></p>
  <p>In spite of the pessimistic tone in which my friend
spoke, I could see that he was quite satisfied with his
surroundings.</p></div2>


           <div2 n="THE KITCHEN COMMITTEE" type="subchapter" id="s42"><head>THE KITCHEN COMMITTEE.</head>

  <p>That most important matter, the cooking of the
meals of members, is entrusted to the Kitchen
Committee,   I must confess that I do not envy

<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>




the chairman of that hard-working body.  I can
fancy how he must be troubled with the equivalents
to <q>backed bills.</q>  Not that the fare is not of
the best.  So far as I have been able to judge,
the viands of the House are of excellent quality
and admirably prepared.  The tariff is certainly
reasonable, perhaps (if an Irishism is excusable)
too reasonable. In spite of the careful control of a
very thoughtful Committee and a liberal contribution
from the privy purse of the House of Commons, its
coffee room has failed to pay its way. Certainly, thus
far there has only been a trifling sum on the wrong
side of the books, but still the fact remains that the
result is loss, not profit.</p>
</div2>

            <div2 n="COFFEE ROOM CHARGES" type="subchapter" id="s43"><head>COFFEE ROOM CHARGES.</head>

  <p>Prices are not high. For is. 6d. a member can get
for lunch a cut off the joint, vegetables, cheese, <q>green
food,</q> and butter, with a pint of lager beer. The
House dinner is also to be commended. A member
can invite his friends (of both sexes) to partake of a
choice of soups, a couple of fishes, two entrees, a bird,
a savoury, and a sweet. For this he has to pay 5s.,
while the club regulation is strictly observed (" No
gratuities to the waiter").  By the way, this rule
caused quite an agitation some time since amongst
the <q>Roberts,</q> and was very nearly the prologue

<pb id="p.59" n="59"/>






of a strike; and here I may remark that the coffee
room attendants wear no livery, but are garbed (as
in restaurants) in plain evening dress. I suppose
were they to appear in appropriate costumes, they
would be seen in scarlet coats and blue knee-breeches.
My reason for this belief rests on the fact that the
building in which Parliament sits is Royal property.
It is called (for that reason) the Palace of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>; and yet, strange to say, the arms of our
Kings and Queens, so conspicuous in the decorations
of the exterior of the building, are rarely found in the
interior. The chairs and china bear only the Portcullis.
I fancy that the device points to the date when St.
Stephen's passed out of the direct control of the first
estate of the realm. When I make this suggestion I
am prepared to learn from the Serjeant-at-Arms (a
member of the Royal household) that the Palace is
still under the direct control of the Crown, and that
Parliament merely partakes of hospitality. The flag-staff
over the Victoria Tower used to be reserved for
the National Standard, run up when the Sovereign
visited St. Stephen's. Of late the Union Jack floats
in the air from sunrise to sunset when the House is
sitting.  I fancy this new  departure must have
obtained the Royal sanction. Certainly the fluttering
of the bunting is an improvement. Why not let us
have the flag all the year round ?</p></div2>

              <div2 n="THE COFFEE ROOMS" type="subchapter" id="s44"><head>THE COFFEE ROOMS.</head>

  <p>There are three principal coffee rooms running
flush with the House, and overlooking the terrace
and the river.  The centre apartment is free to
strangers. A member may thereat feast his personal
friends, who may, by the way, be his political foes;
and here I may remark that from a club point of
view the House, like the Wyndham, the Marlborough,
and the Bachelors', is non-political. Of course it
has its sets. For instance, there are the Unionists and
the Gladstonians, the soldiers and the lawyers, the railway men and supporters of beer, but these sets only
recognize their professional companionship in the
House itself. At <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> the western saloon
is reserved for the heads of the Government and the
Opposition. The Ministerial room has four long
tables; two of them are reserved for members who
have reached Cabinet rank; a couple more for the
Whips and Under Secretaries on either side. Of late
there has sprung into existence a fifth table, which
used to be visited by such celebrities as Mr. Chamberlain and Lord James of Hereford, who used to meet
thereat the Marquis of Hartington, before he became
the Duke of Devonshire, and Mr. Goschen, before
he accepted, with the others mentioned, positions in
the Cabinet. On the west of the strangers' saloon

<pb id="p.61" n="61"/>





is what may be termed the private dining room of
the private members.</p>
  <p>Besides these apartments, there is a large vaultlike chamber level with the terrace, to which ladies are admitted. A member, by giving notice, can hire
this banqueting hall (which to anyone with a lively
imagination is not unsuggestive of the mythical
<q>dungeon beneath the castle moat</q>), and feast his
guests to his heart's, more or less, content. Recently,
hon. gentlemen desirous of keeping a House for some
pet measure, have entertained their political friends in
it. And also on this level are a tea-room, to which the
fair sex can be admitted, and a smoking room for
strangers. But I must confess that all the apartments
flush with the terrace appear to be distinctly gloomy
and better suited to coals than conversation. The
advantage of the site of these rooms is the close
proximity of the terrace. In the summer it is pleasant
enough to sit beside the river, when the tide is
high. On rare occasions, at other times, the fumes
thrown off by mud baking in the sun constitute a bar
to perfect enjoyment.</p>
</div2>

   <div2 n="THE LIBRARY AND THE SMOKING ROOMS" type="subchapter" id="s45"><head>THE LIBRARY AND THE SMOKING ROOMS.</head>

   <p>But perhaps the most imposing part of the House
is the library. The depot of books is divided into
several rooms, all of noble dimensions. The windows

<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>




are on the river front  A casual glance at the
contents of the shelves shows that the volumes have
chiefly to do with the history of Parliament.</p>
  <p><q> I see you do get some new books now and again,</q>
I said to my friend, as I noticed a number of works
laid out on a table.</p>
  <p><q> Yes,</q> he replied. <q>Here, you see, is a
  recently-published life of a well-known statesman.</q>
  <q>No novels?</q>
 <q>Not at present. Up to now we have drawn the
line at biographical romances.</q></p>
  <p>In one of the rooms of the library was the table of
the old House, saved when its former habitation was
burned to the ground. In its neighbourhood was a
bust of the late Sir Erskine May, and other mementoes of the past. I noticed that the members using
the library were hard at work answering letters to
constituents. The stationery bearing the stamp of
the House is always awe-inspiring.</p>
  <p>Having glanced at the bath-rooms and the
<q>barber's shop</q> (modern innovations, and constructed
on familiar lines), I came to the members' smoking
room. This was the pleasantest place in the House.
It has an air of comfort absent from many other of
the rooms.   Mr. <persName key="Gladstone, Herbert">Gladstone</persName> once started a very
sensible arrangement. Over the mantelpiece, while
the House is sitting, appears an announcement (continually changing) of the business occupying the

<pb id="p.63" n="63"/>









attention of members in another (and less agreeable)
place. This <q> affiche </q> might appear with advantage
in all the other rooms used by members.</p></div2>


         <div2 n="A  SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENT" type="subchapter" id="s46"><head>A  SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENT.</head>

  <p>Why not (let me ask) introduce the electrophone
into the recreation rooms of the House? All that
would be necessary would be an arrangement in
telephones. Were this done, the debates would be
heard in every part of the building.  Should my
suggestion be adopted, I trust that truly right hon.
gentlemen will not forget the originator of the improvement.</p>
  <p><q>Now you have seen all there is to see,</q> said my
friend, who had acted as my cicerone. <q> The club part
should be as comfortable as we can make it, for
during the Session we use it morning, noon and night.
We can rarely safely leave it. Some of the members
come when the doors open, and do not quit the
premises until warned by the cry of 'Who goes
home?' that the lights are being extinguished. I
wish we could get some exercise.</q></p>
  <p><q>There is no card-playing at St. Stephen's, is
there ?</q></p>
  <p><q>Certainly not,</q> my friend answered promptly.
<q>Some of the more frivolous of us, however,
occasionally revel in a game of chess.</q></p>

<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>


  <p><q> And how about billiards ? </q>
 <q>I never thought of billiards,</q> answered my host.
<q> Perhaps the House might entertain the suggestion.
The late <persName key="Pope, Alexander">Pope</persName> used to play billiards.</q></p>
   <p>And then my friend and I left <q>the best club in

<p>THERE can be no more impressive sight for a foreigner
than when some State ceremonial collects together a
crowd of Londoners to welcome Royalty. The two
Jubilees, <date value="1887">1887</date> and <date value="1897">1897</date>, were memorable for their
grandeur and enthusiasm, but, perhaps, town is seen
at its best at a popular prince's wedding. The English
people are fond of marriages, and as each of the
<persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName>'s children has taken to himself or herself a
wife or a husband there has been a season of rejoicing.
In spite of a perfunctory discordant note from
<q>the extreme left,</q> the harmony has been complete.
That discord has always been lost in the full volume
of song that has risen from the popular chorus. But
the agitation invariably comes to nothing. The agitators
end by fighting for seats, and describing themselves as
utterly disgusted if they are left out in the
cold and see nothing of the various processions.</p>

         <div2 n="MIND AND LEAVE THE BABY" type="subchapter" id="s48"><head><q> MIND AND LEAVE THE BABY.</q></head>

  <p>I have spoken of a <q> discordant note,</q> but I do not
wish such a sound to be confounded with the words
of wise warning that have been written by that excellent
dramatist, novelist, and man of letters, Mr. G. R.
Sims.  Just before the wedding of the Duke and
Duchess of York a poem by <q> Dagonet</q> appeared, in
which the author suggested to his friend the working
man that when he (the son of toil) and <soCalled>the missus</soCalled>
went out to see the illuminations on the happy occasion
they should leave their baby behind them. I hope
the words may be taken to heart when next there is a
grand function, for certainly they are deserving of
attention. More than a quarter of a century ago,
when the Duke of York's illustrious father was married,
the streets were crowded with an immense throng
of holiday-makers, and there was an ugly rush at
Temple Bar. The old archway, the work of Sir
Christopher Wren, stood (as all the world knows) on
the site now occupied by the Griffin. The Metropolitan
Police were on duty in the Strand, and Fleet
Street was in charge of the City constables. I fancy
that the two bodies, in those distant days, did not act
with the harmony that now is the characteristic of the
joint performance of their important duties. Be this

<pb id="p.67" n="67"/>



as it may, the fight under the archway was something
terrific. There was a stream of people coming East
and a stream coming West, and the two currents met
under the gloomy stones of Temple Bar. I was in
the crowd myself, and it was all I could do to avoid
committing infanticide. There were a number of silly
women, who had brought children with them to see
the sights. I do not think the motive that caused
them to give their offspring such an airing was
entirely unselfish. It may have been possible that the
mothers found it impracticable to leave the babies at
home, and consequently had brought the infants with
them. Whatever may have been the cause the effect
was sad in the extreme. The women, crushed and
screaming, were at length showing they were not
entirely devoid of maternal feeling. <q>Oh,
save the poor child!</q> was the cry from many a sorrowful
mother, and the appeal was disregarded. In such a
crowd it was impossible to move save where the current
directed, and it was as much as one could do to
keep one's feet. In the narrow part of the Strand,
just opposite the offices of Messrs. W. H. Smith and
Sons, I frequently lost my foothold, and was at times
carried by the throng. It was not a pleasant experience.
My great effort was to keep my arms free,
well above the surging crowd. Once find your hands
helpless beside you and your chance of escaping a
fall and a trample becomes a small one. Not that

<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>




the crowd was ill-natured. On the contrary, there
was a general desire to be kind and considerate. The
rough element was conspicuous by its absence. Here
and there were five or six hobbledehoys banded together, arms upon shoulders, in single file. But their
attempted <q>rushes</q> were not tolerated, and with a
shout of <q> Drop it,</q> they were made to desist. But
with all the goodwill in the world it was impossible
to protect a child in the midst of such a crowd. I
was quite a quarter of an hour before I could get
through Temple Bar, and in front of me was a woman
and her baby. I did my best to protect her by pushing with my back against the crush, and I even induced others to follow my example. But after a
while the crowd was too many for us, and we were
swept along. The woman and her little one disappeared in the enormous gathering, and I do not
know what became of them. I can only hope that a
merciful Providence watched over them.  But for
years afterwards the piteous appeal of the poor mother
rang in my ears, <q> Oh, do save the poor child! </q> and
as I write the scene returns to me. The thousands
of lights, the illuminated Prince of Wales's feathers
that had taken the place of the gas lamps, the surging,
laughing crowd, the gaunt old gateway with its
recollections of traitors' heads and suggestions of the
Bridge of Sighs, and the one poor woman battling for
the life of her pale-faced, frightened little one! It

<pb id="p.69" n="69"/>



is not a pleasant memory, and I repeat the warning of
<q>Dagonet,</q> <q>leave the baby at home.</q></p></div2>


      <div2 n="MR. PUNCH ON ROYAL MARRIAGES" type="subchapter" id="s49"><head><q>MR. PUNCH</q> ON ROYAL MARRIAGES.</head>

  <p>To turn to a pleasanter subject. Those who are old
enough to remember the marriage of the Prince of
Wales, and walked like Dr. <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Johnson</persName> (but rather more
expeditiously than he did) down <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, will recollect that <q> No. 85 </q> was filled with a company of fair
ladies and clever men surrounding a quaint statuette
of <q> <hi rend="italics">Mr. Punch</hi>.</q> Those who can boast with the enthusiasm and happiness of youth that it was <q> before
their time</q> will find a sketch of the group in the
volume of the <hi rend="italic">London Charivari</hi> of the period. If
my memory does not play me false the drawing was
from the pencil of the late George Du Maurier, then
the society sketcher of <hi rend="italics">Punch par excellence</hi>. As the
Jester of <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> is a great protector of tradition
the same statuette (once again wearing a wedding
favour) put in an appearance at the wedding of the
Duke and Duchess of York, once again to be surrounded by some of the same familiar faces. One of
those faces was that of the great artist in black and
white who, a few years ago, received well-deserved
honour at the hands of his sovereign. As Sir John
Tenniel has been the cartoonist of <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> since
<date value="1851">1851</date>, it has been his duty to celebrate in the

<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>



pages of the world-famed journal with which
his name is inseparably connected the various
marriages of the members of the Royal Family.
The earliest of them all was the union of the
Princess Royal with Prince William of Prussia-a
union that has given to United Germany her present
Emperor. Mr. <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> was drinking the health of the
happy pair, and ready to throw after them the satin
slipper of good luck. Then came the glorious cartoon of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of
Wales, when the sponsors of the Royal couple were
Britannia and the Sea King of Denmark, and the surrounding throng for the first time suggested the
peoples of the Empire-Australians, Indians, Canadians, and the conquerors of Southern Africa. These
two drawings were followed by others showing sweet
Princess Alice marrying the man of her choice, the
Sailor Prince gathering to himself the Rose of the
North, and the Soldier Duke bringing home his bride.
And not the least popular amongst them was that design which told the world how the Highland laddie
had assisted the Stuart lassie <q> to jump over the ring
fence,</q> to the intense disgust of a not too well favoured
German band. But, whatever the subject, the motive
was the same-the picture showed the genuine joy
that the nation felt in the promise of domestic happiness that each new union shadowed forth. It was the delight of the nation more than a century ago that the

<pb id="p.71" n="71"/>





King was a born Englishman. It is pleasing to think
that at the latest Royal wedding it could be said that
a born English Prince has married a born English
Princess. The Duke and the Duchess can stay in
Britain until the end of the chapter and never find
themselves away from home. Such a reflection is not
without its value at the end of the century, when the
nation regards not entirely with approbation the
continual encroachment of foreign competition.</p></div2>


               <div2 n="NUPTIAL PRESENTS" type="subchapter" id="s50"><head>NUPTIAL PRESENTS.</head>

  <p>But to return to the subject of the keeping of a wedding holiday. The customary expressions of satisfaction on such occasions take the form of presents and
illuminations. The list of the offerings to the Duke
and Duchess of York was instructive. Some of them
were of great intrinsic value, and others of a less
costly character. Lord Salisbury gave the Duke and
Duchess a complete set of his literary works, and I
think another offering consisted of a few bundles of
firewood. No doubt the will was taken for the deed
in every case, and the cost was absolutely outside the
region of consideration. Then there were any number of loyal addresses breathing a spirit of hearty
goodwill, and bearing the signatures of many worthy
and well-meaning individuals. I am glad to think that
these messages of peace were presented in person by

<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>




their authors, but were bound together in a handsome
volume to be read hereafter. We have the authority of
<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> (confirmed by Mr. Henry Arthur Jones)
that <q>Cabinet Ministers are human-very human,</q>
and no doubt Royal Princes and Royal Princesses are
equally human. Accepting this theory, a betrothed
couple on the eve of their wedding had something
better to do than to listen to the pleasing platitudes
of the representatives of public bodies. Of course,
there were those who looked upon the presents as
superfluous, but presumably they were either sour old
bachelors or hypocrites. When young Brown leads to
the altar the lovely Miss Smith, a <q>friend of the
family</q> must be particularly ungenial and possibly
stingy who objects to sending a small <foreign lang="FR">cadeau</foreign> for the
good of the coming house. Many of us could say
that most of the charming <foreign lang="FR">objets de virtu</foreign> that adorn
our reception rooms would never have found their way
to their existing position had it not been for the kind
attention of our wedding guests. Who would buy the
clocks and the knick-knacks that are really so delightful
in the <foreign lang="FR">salon</foreign> and the <foreign lang="FR">salle a manger</foreign> in cold blood?</p>
<p>John Leech years ago showed us the two wedding
gifts of a happy husband. On the first anniversary
of his marriage paterfamilias gave his wife a bouquet
and a bracelet, but a decade later the same gentleman
(now more a paterfamilias than ever) returned home
with a double perambulator and a large bundle of

<pb id="p.73" n="73"/>





asparagus. So it seems ungracious to grudge all the
charming presents that the nation collectively and
individually present to the bride and bridegroom
when there is a wedding in the Royal Family.  I
have noticed that on these auspicious occasions
a few fussy philanthropists invariably suggest the
benefaction of some deserving institution as an
appropriate method of helping the young couple to commence
housekeeping. This seems to me to be rather
a roundabout way of honouring the bride and bridegroom,
and appears to deserve the title of <q> charity
away from home.</q> Wedding presents, as a rule, are
more numerous than select, and happy are the newly married
who do not find themselves possessors of
dozens of silver card-cases and grosses of carriage-clocks.
But in the instance of a Royal wedding, when
everybody tells everybody else what they are going
to send, a greater choice of objects becomes possible.</p></div2>


             <div2 n="WEDDING DECORATIONS" type="subchapter" id="s51"><head>WEDDING DECORATIONS.</head>

  <p>A glance at the streets on the occasion of a Royal
wedding shows that stars and capital letters in
gas-pipe are in high favour with those who wish to illuminate. More elaborate designs in crystal are also received with approbation. The old <q>Vauxhall oil
lamps</q> of our forefathers seem to have lost their
popularity, although in the shape of <q>fairy lights</q>

<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>





they appear as the survival of the fittest. Nowadays,
at times of general rejoicing, there seems to be a
general desire for a house-to-house illumination. Perhaps I may be permitted to suggest what I believe
to be rather a novel form of decoration. I tried the
system with some success during the Jubilee, and provoked a feeling of envy amongst my neighbours. The
plan has only one slight drawback-if you are not
careful you may burn your house down, and possibly
then find that the illumination is not <q>covered</q> by
your policy of insurance. However, given scrupulous
attention to details and decent good luck, and you
should avoid all danger and expense and create quite
a sensation.</p>
  <p>My idea is this. Convert your mansion into a reproduction of those miniature chalk cathedrals that
look so well when their windows are <q> cut out</q> and
filled in with coloured glass and the whole lighted up
with a candle. All you have to do is to get a large
quantity of tissue paper. Say you select pink and
blue. Having procured your materials, fill up the portico with strips of the paper, and cover over every
pane of glass with the same semi-opaque medium.
Then put candles in profusion behind the paper, and
the thing is done.  In special celebration of Her
Majesty's Jubilee I tried a transparency, but I cannot
conscientiously declare that it was wholly a success.
I got a very large box and covered it over with thick

<pb id="p.75" n="75"/>




brown paper. Then I <q>let in</q> the words <q>Long
Live the <persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName>.</q> I put a moderator lamp behind
the covering.  For five minutes it was absolutely
charming. But with the sixth minute the thing burst
into flames, and for some moments it was a question
whether or no we should invoke the assistance of the
Fire Brigade of the L.C.C. Fortunately, the conflagration <q> burned itself out</q> without doing any serious
damage, and as everybody was looking at the illuminations, we escaped a visit of the gentlemen in occupation of the salvage vans. This was distinctly a score,
as <q> salvage </q> is always an expensive matter.</p></div2>


                  <div2 n="CONCLUSION" type="subchapter" id="s52"><head>CONCLUSION.</head>

  <p>In conclusion, the way to keep a wedding holiday
happily is to avoid dangerous crushes, oil lamps, and
boy assistants. If you want to be quite safe-if the
illumination is general-you can stay at home. You
may, under these circumstances, spend a cheerful
evening in admiring your own device and sneering at the
devices of your neighbours. But, above all, and before
all-whatever your rank in life may be-if you go
abroad amongst the admiring million, be sure <q>to
leave the baby.</q> On occasions, when London is out
in its millions, there is emphatically (for infants) no
place like home.</p>

        <div2 n="THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLUB." type="subchapter" id="s53"><head>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLUB.</head>

<p>OF course, everyone can give a history of the club
movement. It is common knowledge that the magnificent palaces in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName> and <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>, <placeName key="St. James's Street">St. James's Street</placeName> and <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>, grew out of the
coffee houses kept by such men as White, Brookes
and Boodles. These respected individuals (who
appeared and disappeared in the last century) knew
literally <q>how to labour and how to wait.</q> I suppose the latest survival of what may be termed <q> the
club coffee-house</q> was Evans's in <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>-a
hostelrie that long since has ceased being a name,
and is (alas!) rapidly fading as a memory. <q> Paddy </q>
Green has gone, and before he retired, with his
kind wishes for everyone's fireside and his snuff-box,
the collection of theatrical pictures in <q>the cafe
part</q> had been scattered far and wide by a sale by
auction. The <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> table, and the <hi rend="italics">Fun</hi> table, and

<pb id="p.77" n="77"/>









the corner haunted by Lord Henry Lennox, Serjeant
Ballantyne, and Mr. Lionel Lawson have vanished
into air, and the glees and suppers and <q> calculating
waiter</q> are visions of the past. It is true that a
<hi rend="italics">cercle</hi> with a Bar-sounding title that was started some
years ago in the neighbourhood of the Temple was of
nearly as informal a character as Evans's, but in other
respects the resemblance between the two establishments was not particularly remarkable. All sorts of
stories are told about this club. One friend was
treating another to numbers of whiskies-and-sodas.
<q>I really cannot allow you to pay for another,</q> said
the guest. <q> Then pay for it yourself,</q> suggested the
host. <q>But I am not a member,</q> urged the guest.
<q>No more am I! </q> was the prompt rejoinder. Then
there were legends of the pockets of the waiters
being deprived of their contents while they (the servants) were handing round coffee; and the marker
complained that a member had walked off with
half-a-dozen billiard balls while a star was being
marked at pool. It was said that the committee refused to take any notice of the first offence because
the property of the waiters did not belong to the
club; but they put up a notice calling upon <q>the
gentleman who had taken by mistake</q> the ivory to
return it to the house steward. I need scarcely say
that many of these amusing stories formed a part of
that magnificent collection of <q>chestnuts</q> in the

<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>



possession of that most <q>amusing rattle,</q> Mr. Ben
Trovato. And another of these anecdotes possibly
tells the tale of a gentleman who preferred to belong
to <q>the five-shillings list of members</q> instead of
paying the full five guineas demanded from  his
companions as the regulation annual subscription.</p>
  <p><q> How do you manage it? </q> asked a friend. <q>Is it
arranged with the secretary?</q>
  <q> Oh no,</q> was the reply. <q>I give the hall-porter a
couple of half-crowns on Boxing Day, and he passes
one in for the rest of the season!</q></p>
  <p>But of course such a state of things nowadays at
the end of the century is utterly impossible. I suppose
I must be writing of a time when the <q>admission
gratis</q> coffee house was maturing into the proprietary club, with its safeguards of committee, candidates' book, ballot box, entrance fees, and first year's
donation payable in advance.
</p></div2>

     <div2 n="POLITICAL CLUBS AND THEIR JUNIORS" type="subchapter" id="s54"><head>POLITICAL CLUBS AND THEIR <q>JUNIORS.</q></head>

  <p>A few lines about political clubs. Of course, the
Carlton, Conservative, and Reform, to say nothing
of White's and Brooks's, are right enough. And to
the list may be added I suppose <q>the Juniors,</q>
although some people say that it takes a good twenty
years to weed a newly-started party circle. I have
so many friends in the Junior Carlton that I would

<pb id="p.79" n="79"/>



not wish to say a word condemnatory of the past of
that most comfortable institution, still, a glance at the
Candidates' Book of <date value="1899">1899</date>, in <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>, would no
doubt reveal names and professions very different from
the names and professions that used to appear in
earlier volumes. The Junior Carlton of <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName> is
a vast improvement on the Junior Carlton that occupied the premises of the Old Parthenon on the
Regent Street side of Waterloo Place. In days to
come the same no doubt will be said of other political Juniors. Like good wine, they will improve as
years roll on. Rome was not built in a day, and the
prestige of a club cannot be obtained with the same
celerity as marble, morocco, Turkey carpets, and the
electric light. And here I may suggest that the
young man from the country should be a little
careful of joining clubs that advertise and circularise
for members. <placeName key="Dover Street">Dover Street</placeName> and Albemarle Street
are famous for these mushroom societies. When I
was a boy I was induced to belong to a club called
by a Service title. I fancy we started in <placeName key="Dover Street">Dover Street</placeName>.
Soon we (I mean the owner) prospered, and
took a house in <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>. It was a beautiful house,
divided from the Guards by the premises of the
London Joint Stock Bank (in those days partly used
for a boarding house), and the principal entrance was
garnished with medallions of Nelson and Wellington.
We did not get on, however, very well in our new

<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>




diggings, and one day someone called us unkindly
the <q>Junior Criterion,</q> upon which we collapsed. I
need scarcely say that I had left the club long before
the final disaster.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="A COUPLE OF CELEBRATED REVIVALS" type="subchapter" id="s55"><head>A COUPLE OF CELEBRATED REVIVALS.</head>

  <p>Leaving mushroom clubs, I turn my attention to
the Bohemian communities with which I fancy the
Eccentrics would be proud to claim kinsmanship. I
hope I am divulging no confidences when I hint that
the Eccentrics themselves, although scarcely ten
years old, can look back to a history which commenced with the initial year of the nineteenth century.
In <date value="1800">1800</date> there was an Eccentric Club, which flourished
until <date value="1846">1846</date>. All sorts of great people belonged to it
-judges, peers, and wits. I fancy (and now I speak
under correction) that Lord Denman was a member.
I am under the impression that not only Sheridan
but Sheridan Knowles were on the list. By the way
the latter <q> turned serious,</q> and scorned the plays he
had written with as much contempt as their modern
audiences. And the fact that the Eccentric is a revival reminds me that there was another Beef Steak
before the establishment of that charming institution
which once had its quarters over <q>the front of the
house </q> at Toole's Theatre in King William Street.
My friend, Sir Henry Irving, has, I fancy, the original

<pb id="p.81" n="81"/>





silver grill of the ancient society, and before now I
have sat in the club-room on the prompt side of the
Lyceum Theatre wherein the wits of the eighteenth
century used to congregate for the consumption of
port and the discussion of the affairs of the nation,
both over and under the table. The revived Steak
was originated in the rooms of the late R. Corney
Grain. These chambers were in <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall Place</placeName>, and
were situated over a suite of palatial apartments belonging to one of the finest journalists, novelists,
dramatists, and essayists of modern times. For the
moment I forget his name, but, during the Commune,
he was called in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> (where his writings were as
well known as in town), no doubt on account of his
defence of all that was hateful to the Communist
cause, <soCalled>le Monstre.</soCalled> He was a fine fellow, this great
journalist, and was an original member of that Steak
when his friend (the late R. Corney Grain) called the
society into revived existence. Among other works
of great importance, he was the author of <q>Greenroom Recollections.</q></p></div2>


        <div2 n="THE SAVAGE AND THE ARUNDEL" type="subchapter" id="s56"><head>THE SAVAGE AND THE ARUNDEL.</head>

  <p>Then there was the Savage, and a little later the
Arundel. I have belonged to both and can testify to
the delightful hours spent in the neighbourhood of
<placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName> and Salisbury Street, Strand. The


<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>





history of the Savage is given in the preface of the
first volume of the Savage Club Papers. I was
looking at the volume only the other day, and
admiring the frontispiece. It contained any number
of portraits. The Savages were grouped round the
offspring of their brains. In the centre was that
magnificent figure of an old Bohemian, Dr. Strauss.
Round about him were crowded Halliday, Jeff
Prowse, J. C. Brough, H. J. <persName key="Byron, Henry J.">Byron</persName> , George Rose,
Harry Leigh, Artemus Ward, Planche, Tom Robertson, Clement Scott, John Holingshead, George
Cruikshank, and Tegetmeier. Quite in the background were two writers who have since come well
to the front. It was natural enough to see them side
by side, for their fathers (both eminent men of
letters) had been the staunchest of staunch friends.
The first of these workers in the background was
Mr. W. S. Gilbert, and the other (to give him his
French title) was <q>Monsieur Chose.</q> I had the
honour of contributing almost my first story to the
Savage Club Papers. It was simply beautiful. It
contained a duel, a murder, an abduction, and all
sorts of horrible incidents, and had the cheerful title
of <q> Found Drowned.</q></p>
  <p><q>Is it to be illustrated?</q> I eagerly asked  the
editor.</p>
  <p><q>Yes, my dear fellow,</q> replied Andrew Halliday.
<q>I forget what the cut was about, but I know it fits

<pb id="p.83" n="83"/>





in excellently. I am sure you will be charmed when
you see it. Of course it was not drawn for the
story, but it is most appropriate. Look out for a
pleasant surprise.</q></p>
  <p>I did; and on the publication of the Papers discovered that <q> Found Drowned </q> had been illustrated
with a sketch of an idiotic stork standing on one leg
in a puddle in front of a feeble waterfall! When I
complained to Andrew Halliday afterwards he said,
in a sorrowful tone, <q> So like you young authors, you
are never satisfied! And I so considerate, too! If
I had given it to you to be written up to it would
have completely spoilt your story! You, with your
duels and murders and the rest of it, didn't want a
stork on one leg. Not you! The story was better
without it! </q></p>
  <p>I did not reply, but my heart (in its own fashion)
consented. Thinking the matter over now, I am
convinced that Andrew Halliday was a model editor.
His motto seemed to be <q> acts, and then (if necessary)
apologies.</q></p>
  <p>The Arundel was also a delightful gathering of
lawyers, wits, and actors. However, it lacked the
entertainments of the Savage, and never rushed into
amateur theatricals. The gentlemen with the fierce
titles and kindly hearts once appeared before the
<persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName> and the late <persName key="Albert">Prince Consort</persName> in a piece written
by themselves and played by their own company.</p></div2>

         <div2 n="A RECIPE FOR CLUB-MAKING" type="subchapter" id="s57"><head>A RECIPE FOR CLUB-MAKING.</head>

  <p>To justify the title of this chapter, I jot down
the <foreign lang="LA">modus operandi</foreign> of starting a social club. Get
a small committee (say a dozen) of really popular
men. Get each of the committee to secure twenty
really popular candidates.  Elect them, and they,
with their proposers and seconders, will form the
list of original members.  Make your annual subscription as small as you can.  Take rooms well
within the resources of the club, and furnish plainly
and comfortably. Get a good paid secretary
(honorary work is never quite satisfactory), and let
him labour his hardest. Pill a few doubtful candidates, inclusive (if possible) of a questionable peer. And when you have got to this stage you will find
that the club is self-supporting.</p></div2>

<p>IT must not be supposed for a moment that when I
head this chapter with its chosen title, that I propose to
treat of second-rate clubs or <hi rend="italics">cercles</hi> of questionable
respectability. I wish only to deal with that sort of
<q>clubland </q> that is to be found in London, from the
end of August until the close of September. At that
time town is supposed to be empty, and consequently all members are imagined to be on the Continent, or away shooting, or at the seaside. As a matter
of fact, a very large number of Londoners are tied
by the leg to their customary habitation, and it is
those unfortunate people who feel the inconvenience
of being guests against their will, or hosts contrary to
their inclination.  Without being grossly selfish, I
think a man may claim to take his leisure at his inn,
which is old style for enjoying himself at his club.
That he can do that in a temporary home is questionable.


<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>



Away from his favourite haunts, and finding
familiar faces lost in a crowd of strangers, he feels
like the lady who mislaid the lost chord-<q> weary and
ill at ease.</q> There is no luncheon table sacred to a
select set, and even there is a difficulty in finding a
<q> chatable corner</q> in the smoking room. So, until
his own club emerges from a condition of closure
for <q>alterations and  repairs,</q> he refrains  from
visiting <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>, <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, or <placeName key="St. James's Street">St. James's Street</placeName>; or
makes up his mind to go abroad.  When <q>the Senior </q>
absorbs the Bishops', and <q>the Junior</q> migrates to
<placeName key="St. James's Square">St. James's Square</placeName>, matters become rather mixed in
clubland.</p></div2>


    <div2 n="CLOSED FOR ALTERATIONS AND REPAIRS" type="subchapter" id="s59"><head><q>CLOSED FOR ALTERATIONS AND REPAIRS.</q></head>

  <p>I suppose there are no worthier set of men than
club secretaries, and yet it is said that many of the
West-end <foreign lang="FR">cercles</foreign> would remain open all the year
round were it not that the <q>honorary members</q>
wanted a little shooting in August and September.
I think the suggestion scarcely fair. On most House
Committees there is a committee-man who would willingly undertake to act as <foreign lang="LA">locum tenens</foreign> for <q> the adjutant of the club.</q> Colonel Chose or <q>good old
Gooseberry</q> are always available. Both know the
average cost of the servants' board (after taking into
consideration the <q>leavings </q> of the coffee-room), and

<pb id="p.87" n="87"/>




both are ready to deal with <q>backed bills </q> and the
other grievances incidental to <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> humanity. Chose
for many years was president of his regimental mess,
and <q>good old Gooseberry,</q> before he became <q> Resident </q> to His Highness of Chutneypore, was an A.D.C.
to the Governor-General, so they are equally qualified
to perform the responsible duties incidental to the
proud position of secretary to the Parthenon. Still,
closure <q>for alterations and repairs</q> saves a world
of trouble, and Colonel Pillington, under those conditions, finds it unnecessary to ask a favour of anyone. By Colonel Pillington I mean the average club
secretary. He gets from &#x00A3;300 to &#x00A3;600 a year, and
has been selected from about a thousand candidates.
Many years ago, as a member of the committee of a
well-known West-end club, I had to assist in the selection and election of a secretary. We had any number
of applicants for the post-generals, colonels, barristers, and a couple of baronets. Strange to say, no
sailor applied, and retired members of the Civil Service were also conspicuous by their absence.  The
selection of six <q>possibles </q> was entrusted to a subcommittee, who duly reported to the main body. The
half-dozen containing the secretary-elect were duly
summoned to meet their electors face to face. Our
chairman put several test questions, one of which was
<q>Whom do you consider the most important personage in the club? </q> Five answered <q> The chairman of

<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>




the committee </q>; the last <q>The cook.</q> We elected
the gentleman whose appreciation of the <q>chef</q>
showed that he fully understood club requirements.</p></div2>


       <div2 n="THE CLUB THAT IS ALWAYS OPEN" type="subchapter" id="s60"><head>THE CLUB THAT IS ALWAYS OPEN.</head>

  <p>There is one club in London that has the reputation of never closing its doors from one year's end to
the end of another. I refer to the Garrick. But I
am afraid that the reputation is not entirely merited,
because a few years ago the <q>pleasantest <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> in
town</q> did shut up for a few weeks to carry out some
structural alterations indispensable to the comfort of
its members. But even then the Garrick proudly refused to ask for shelter elsewhere. The famed <foreign lang="LA">coterie</foreign>
of <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName> does not exchange hospitalities
with kindred institutions for an excellent reason. If
you accept favours you must confer them. No doubt
the Athenaeum would be glad to shelter the Garrick,
but it is just possible that the sacred smoking-room,
with its Clarkson Stansfield over the mantelpiece and
its John Gilbert between the windows, is full enough
at all events to do without an invasion of scientists
and ecclesiastics.  Be this as it may, the Garrick
neither grants nor seeks hospitality. With the solitary exception to which I have referred, it has been
continuously open for something like half a century.
May its shadow never grow less. That shadow was

<pb id="p.89" n="89"/>



wont to fall in <placeName key="King Street">King Street</placeName>, but nowadays it darkens
the pavement of a rue christened in the club's honour.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="EVANS'S THE EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE" type="subchapter" id="s61"><head>EVANS'S THE EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE.</head>

  <p>And when I write of the Garrick I am naturally
reminded of that excellent substitute for a <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign>
--unconventional and yet select--that used to flourish
within a stone's throw of its handsome and massive
portals. I refer once more to Evans's in the days of
<q>Paddy</q> Green-when Lionel Lawson and Henry
Lennox, Ballantyne and <q>Ponny</q> Mayhew used to
congregate near the fireplace in the <hi rend="italics">cafe</hi>.  There
never was a better club-house-without entrance
fee and without subscription-than <q>the Supper
Rooms.</q> Go when you would you found <q>everyone in town.</q>  There was only one rival meeting-place, and that was the long smoking room
of the Raleigh, when that <foreign lang="LA">coterie</foreign> of warriors
and ex-warriors used to <q>keep</q> under the old
Gallery of Illustration in Regent Street.  But
the company of the club was limited, and the habitues
of the Supper Rooms numberless. <q> Paddy</q> Green
had been an old actor. He had played the Charlie
in the theatrical adaptation of <q>Tom  and Jerry</q>
when the piece was produced at the Old Adelphi.
He was consequently full of anecdotes of Yates,
Keeley, and Power. Hanging to the walls of the

<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>





<hi rend="italics">cafe</hi> part of the building were any number of theatrical portraits. Some of them were of considerable
merit, others sad daubs. I wonder what became of
them. They were sold by auction when Evans's lost
its licence. Who were the purchasers? I fancy that
my accomplished friend, Sir Henry Irving, got some
of them, but of this I am not sure. But with or
without pictures, Evans's was a pleasant and interesting place, and never so popular as when regular clubland was disorganised by <q> alterations and repairs.</q></p></div2>


       <div2 n="THE WORK OF THE HALL-PORTER" type="subchapter" id="s62"><head> THE WORK OF THE HALL-PORTER.</head>

  <p>When the <foreign lang="FR">cercles</foreign> are exchanging courtesies the
value of the hall-porter is fully felt.  This useful
official is expected to know every member by sight,
and to be particularly on the alert when his gentlemen
are guests. At one time I belonged to some thirteen
clubs-in the days of the long ago when the latch
key was more in requisition than at present-and
some of those I visited not more than once or twice
a year. And yet I was always known. Since then
gigantic <foreign lang="FR">cercles</foreign> have sprung up, with three times as
many members as the normal total of a large Westend club of the first class, and yet the subscription
payers are recognised and passed. It may be taken
that two thousand is the outside total of a recognised
<q>co-operative palace.</q>  At two large places, one in

<pb id="p.91" n="91"/>




<placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName> and the other on the Thames Embankment,
I believe the number is doubled if not trebled. Fancy
a hall-porter being expected to know and recognise
as belonging to members of his club six thousand
faces! And yet I believe this is not only a possibility
but an actuality. There is only one story on record
of a non-member gaining admission to a club and
using it as his own. The enterprising individual,
however, on attempting to change a bogus cheque,
was discovered and promptly arrested. The club in
which he was run to earth was, of all places in the
world, the Guards-the smallest and most select spot
in all clubland!</p></div2>


      <div2 n="THE EXCHANGE OF CLUB COURTESIES" type="subchapter" id="s63"><head>THE EXCHANGE OF CLUB COURTESIES.</head>

  <p>The exchange of courtesies is the natural outcome
of kindred tastes and political opinions. The Carlton
absorbs its junior, and the Guards accepts hospitality
from and gives it to its <foreign lang="FR">vis-a-vis</foreign> the Marlborough.
The Oxford and Cambridge is on visiting terms with
the Old University, and the Union and the Travellers
are frequently friendly. Of late years the Service
clubs have been slightly at loggerheads. The Rag,
once great <q>pals</q> with the Junior, has arranged
with the Naval and Military, a <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> that for about
a couple of years had a habitation without a name
within the hospitable walls of the J.U.S.C. Nowadays


<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>





those who live in Cambridge House have no
room for their hosts, and act accordingly. For all
that the Junior is happy in joining hands with the
East India, the spot sacred to the most excellent of
curries. Brooks's, White's, Boodle's, Arthur's, and the
other <q> social </q> clubs select partners without difficulty.
After all, the closure only lasts a month or six weeks,
when every member, according to the strict rule of
the game, should be out of town.</p>
  <p>And when the period is over the return to the renovated club-houses is pleasant indeed; for that return
means familiar haunts to <foreign lang="FR">habitues</foreign>, and to all the rest
the meeting of old friends and the absence of
strangers.</p></div2>

<p>EVERYONE of any status in Town (especially if he
has remained a bachelor until years of discretion) has
a <q>second club.</q> And that he has what may be
termed <q>an alternative <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign>,</q> proves the customary
proprietary right in a first or principal co-operative
palace. As a matter of course, a youngster, when he
leaves school or the university, is put up by his father
or some near relative for some appropriate survival
of the old coffee houses of the Georges. If the boy
is destined for the Church his name naturally appears
on the books of the Oxford and Cambridge, or the
<q>Old University</q> in Suffolk Street. If he is to
belong to either of the Services, he chooses the
Junior United Service, the Naval and Military, or
the Rag. If he is simply to remain a country gentleman, then the doors of White's, or Brooks's, or
Boodle's are open to him. Of course, if he is to be

<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>



a fervent politician he must choose the Carlton or
the Reform, the Conservative, the Constitutional, the
National Liberal, or (perhaps) the Devonshire. And
having got himself elected to any one of the establishments to which I have referred, he is in a position to look about him for a <q> second club.</q></p></div2>

           <div2 n="FIRSTS AND SECONDS" type="subchapter" id="s65"><head><q>FIRSTS</q> AND <q>SECONDS.</q></head>

  <p>In these days of rapid growths, I am not quite sure
that such old-fashioned institutions as the Union,
the Windham, and the Raleigh, would care to be
called <q> second clubs,</q> and yet thirty years ago they
certainly had no claim to be put on a par with the
Carlton. But in the long ago of the sixties a man
would call his second club <q>a pot house.</q> He did
not mean to degrade his junior <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> to the level of
a tavern, but merely to imply that he had been
elected to something better. Nowadays he would
perhaps hesitate about the description as the
old-fashioned  <q> seconds</q> are  sometimes
so  much worthier than the new-fangled <q> firsts.</q></p>
</div2>

          <div2 n="CLUBS FOLLOW THE FLAG" type="subchapter" id="s66"><head><q> CLUBS FOLLOW THE FLAG.</q></head>

 <p> It may be accepted, I think, that Englishmen are
naturally <q>clubable.</q> Some little while since I was
looking through a small book which purported to
give all the clubs in the world. It really contained a

<pb id="p.95" n="95"/>



vast amount of information, but the sum total of the
news was this-that Englishmen had their clubs all
the world over. It seems the right thing to do. Say
that Brown, Jones, and Robinson visit a hitherto
undiscovered island. After taking possession of it
in the name of the Sovereign they begin to develop
it. The operation entails the presence of Smith,
Snooks, Jones, and McTab. There comes hundreds
more, and after their arrival, thousands. Churches
and chapels spring up side by side with shops and
factories. Villas begin to appear on the outskirts of
what was once a desert, but is now a rising town.
Then the following conversation is held.</p>
  <p><q> I say, Jones,</q> says Brown, <q>were you a member
of the Garrick?</q></p>
  <p><q>No, I managed through being put down by
my godfather to get into the Athenaeum! </q>
  <q>And, Mr. Robinson, what club had the advantage
of your name as that of a member living abroad?</q>
  <q>I? Oh, I joined the St. James's because my
people thought I might go in for diplomacy. But
then, of course, I became a member of the Conservative.</q>
  <q>I say, oughtn't we to have a club ?</q> continues
Brown, putting a second question. And then the
first <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> in Undiscoverdia is founded. Brown (of
the Garrick), Jones (of the Athenaeum), and Robinson (of the Conservative and the St. James's) are the

<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>



first committeemen. Candidates rush in. Some are
pilled, and the pilling creates a sensation. In a year
or two the club becomes a most flourishing institution. It has a fine house, a good cellar, an imposing hall-porter. In fact, it is a colonial version of <q> home,
sweet home.</q></p>
  <p>But what does the Frenchman, if he finds himself
away from civilisation-that is to say, out of reach of
<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>?  He meets his equals at the <hi rend="italics">cafe</hi>. He plays
dominoes with much skill, and sips absinthe.
  <q>I belonged to the Pommes de Terre,</q> says Jules.
  There is a pause. Alphonse is not particularly
interested, and Gustave yawns.
  <q>It was an amusing <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign>,</q> continues Jules. <q>I
wonder if we could have one here. We might get
the papers and the table d'hote and distractions. It
seems to be a happy thought. What do you say ? </q>
  <q> That I prefer the <hi rend="italics">cafe</hi>,</q> replies Alphonse.
 <q>That I want another game of dominoes,</q> returns
Gustave.
  And so the matter is allowed to drop.
  It is said that <q> Trade follows the flag.</q> I think we
might add as a rider that <q> clubland keeps step with
the Union Jack.</q></p></div2>

           <div2 n="LAMBS AND LAMBKINS" type="subchapter" id="s67"><head><q>LAMBS</q> AND <q>LAMBKINS.</q></head>

  <p>About thirty years ago (when we were all more or
less children) dining clubs were in great favour.

<pb id="p.97" n="97"/>



These were scarcely <q>seconds</q> or <soCalled>pot houses;</soCalled>
they were only <hi rend="italics">coteries</hi>. The Lambs were renowned
for their pleasant dinners, and soon had <soCalled>a junior </soCalled>
in the shape of <soCalled>The Lambkins.</soCalled> Certain <q> reverend
seigneurs </q> who now object (out of season) to listen
to the chimes at midnight, belonged to these festive
gatherings. In the sixties there was a song which
was often heard at Evans's on a boat-race night, sung
by amateurs, with the title, <q> Come and be a Rollicking Ram.</q> The Lambs and the Lambkins were
both more or less <q>rollicking.</q> Then there was the
Wig Wam (not for a moment to be confounded with
the Savage), wherein certain mysterious rites were
performed before a candidate could be admitted to
membership. The dinners of those clubs were eaten
in the near neighbourhood of the Haymarket Theatre.
They have vanished, and have left, I think, but few
successors. At the end of the century we have the
Kinsmen, the New Vagabonds, and the Argonauts.
But perhaps the most popular of the newer generations of <hi rend="italics">coteries</hi> were respectively known as the <q> Two
Pins</q> and the <q> Charivari.</q>
</p></div2>

                 <div2 n="THE TWO PINS" type="subchapter" id="s68"><head>THE TWO PINS.</head>

  <p>A few seasons ago the Two Pins Club was so
frequently referred to in the columns of <q>London
Day by Day,</q> in <hi rend="italics">The Daily Telegraph</hi>, that its


<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>
existence no longer remained a mere myth but
appeared as an established fact.  As I cannot claim
to be a member myself, I betray no confidences when
I reveal what I have heard about it.  I fancy it consisted
of about fourteen members-all of them good
fellows, and many of them distinguished men.  I
believe it was necessary to ride and possess a horse.
It was against the rule to follow the hunt for lunch
on a bicycle or even a four wheeler.</p>
	<p><q>But why the Two Pins?</q> I asked, in the days of
my ignorance.</p>
	<p><q>From the surnames of a couple of British horsemen
representing respectablity and daring-the final
syllables of Gil-<hi rend="italic">pin</hi> and Tur-<hi rend="italic">pin</hi>.  See?</q></p>
	<p>I did <q>see,</q> and greatly appreciated the cleverness.
I believe the title was chosen by the life and soul of
the Club-a gentleman who has long figured as a
humorist of the first water.</p>
	<p><q>And what is the object of the Two Pins Club?</q>
I asked.</p>
	<p><q>A good ride before luncheon,</q> was the answer;
<q>the gallant horsemen prefer <hi rend="italic">menus</hi> to foxes, and
<foreign lang="FR">chasse cafes</foreign> to hares.  And as they are all good fellows,
laughter attends upon appetite.</q></p></div2>

<div2 n="THE CHARIVARI CLUB" type="subchapter" id="s69"><head>THE CHARIVARI CLUB</head>

	<p>But perhaps one of the most promising of the
auxiliaries of London clubland is a rather mysterious


<pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

circle known as <q>The Charivari.</q>  It certainly has a
President and a Vice-President, and I have seen
mentioned (in the columns of the Press) a <q>foreign
section.</q>  From the sources of information open to
the public I have learned that the members of the
Charivari are great people for lunching.  About a
year ago the Charivaris met at <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> and broke their
fast at the <hi rend="italic">buffet</hi>.  From what I am told I believe the
club to be unique.  The other day I interviewed a
very prominent member.</p>
	<p><q>Who are eligible for election?</q> I asked, with a
fine scorn for Lindley Murray.</p>
	<p><q>Only good fellows; but we do not consider
nationality.  Still if a Chinaman were to put up, he
might perhaps find that the line was drawn at a
resident of Yokohama.</q></p>
	<p><q>Are ladies admitted?</q></p>
	<p><q>Only as visitors, and then they must be cousins,
sisters, or aunts, added, of course, to daughters and
wives.</q></p>
	<p><q>Have the ladies any privileges?</q></p>
	<p><q>Only of being entertained.  But it is an unwritten
law that their titular lords and masters may do what
they please.  They may light up without permission,
and order another bottle without reproach.</q></p>
	<p><q>And will the Charivari live and prosper?</q></p>
	<p>Then came the sharp and decisive answer, <q>It <hi rend="italic">has</hi>
lived and <hi rend="italic">does</hi> prosper.</q></p></div2>

the <q>Olde Set of Odde Volumes,</q> renowned for its
good fare both mental and culinary, or the Casuals,

<p>BOXING Day at the end of the century is still
associated with Christmas boxes. As a rule, those
boxes are rather a tax upon those whose duty
(a duty, however, sometimes combined with a
pleasure) it is to supply them.   But there is
to everyone, whether it be the host who has purchased
it or the guest who has accepted the host's
valued hospitality. I need scarcely add after these
observations that I refer to a box at the Drury Lane
pantomime. Every year the annual has become
more difficult to compose, for the simple reason that
its originator has made it a point to beat his own
record. Year after year, from <date value="1879">1879</date>
to <date value="1893">1893</date>, the late
lessee of the National Theatre determined to make
his present pantomime better than the one of the
year past, and by universal consent accomplished the
seemingly impossible feat. And since the death of

<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>



Sir Augustus his successor has satisfactorily attempted
the task of his predecessor. I had the privilege of
witnessing the preparation for what is now known as
Harris's last pantomime. As a spectacle it was the
ultimate word of the century.
</p></div2>

            <div2 n="PANTOMIMES OF THE PAST" type="subchapter" id="s72"><head>PANTOMIMES OF THE PAST.</head>

   <p>I must frankly confess I had no knowledge of how
many things had to be done to produce a pantomime
until I had made the inspection to which I have just
referred. I rather pride myself upon an intimate
acquaintance with things theatrical, and from a very
early age have been accustomed to visit that place of
disillusions, <q>the land behind the scenes.</q> In years
gone by I have been present <q> on the other side of
the footlights</q> when <hi rend="italics">Jack the Giant Killer</hi> was
being performed at the Princess's Theatre. The
father of Sir Augustus Harris was the lessee of the
theatre, and M. Zola might point to the fact in support of his theory of heredity. <hi rend="italics">Jack the Giant
Killer</hi> was one of the most successful of pantomimes
ever produced outside the walls of Drury Lane, but
it was not to be compared with the modern annual.
As the ironclad of the present is to the wooden
three-decker of the past, so is the Panto of to-day to the
Panto of five-and-twenty years ago. Everything
nowadays is on an infinitely grander scale. Where

<pb id="p.103" n="103"/>




there was but one ballet scene, there are now three
or four; where there was a solitary procession, there
are now half-a-dozen; where there was a company
of fifty or sixty, there is now an army numbering the
greater part of a thousand. Those who were sufficiently fortunate to be present in Drury Lane during
the run of the pantomime watched the evolutions of
no  less than  seven  hundred  persons.  Fancy,
seven hundred persons dressed and drilled and
taught to dance and sing to amuse the children!
That those children are of all ages is true enough,
for grandfather and grandson are equally delighted.
It is a sign of the times that nowadays no one
thinks of apologising for visiting the pantomime.
In the pretty-long-ago <q>we went to please the
little ones; </q> now we go to please ourselves.  It
may be justly said that no Christmas holidays are
complete without a visit to the pantomime. And I
write <q>the pantomime</q> advisedly. In the case of
Yule-Tide entertainments there has been a distinct
survival of the fittest.</p></div2>


<div2 n="JACK THE GIANT KILLER, AT THE PRINCESS'S" type="subchapter" id="s73"><head><q>JACK THE GIANT KILLER,</q> AT THE PRINCESS'S.</head>

  <p>I have mentioned <hi rend="italics">Jack the Giant Killer</hi>, at the
Princess's, and it may be interesting to old playgoers
to jot down a few particulars. Miss Louise Keeley,
daughter of Mrs. Keeley, and wife of Montagu

<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>




Williams, was <q>the principal boy.</q>  Saker, Widdicomb, J. G. Shore, and Espinosa were also in the
cast. The giant was the finest then on record. He
could open and close his eyes, walk, talk, sing, and
dance. Poor Henry <persName key="Byron, Henry J.">Byron</persName> was the author, and I
remember one line that Mr. J. G. Shore (who was as
good in pantomime as in romantic drama) used to
give with much unction and infinite effect:-


<quote rend="blockquote">I go to Bath! With rage my hair doth <hi rend="italics">Bristol</hi>.</quote>

That was a pun of the period! I am afraid it would
scarcely be favourably criticised by the exponents of
the <q> new humour.</q> Espinosa was a graceful dancer,
who subsequently made his mark as Friday in the
pantomime of <hi rend="italics">Robinson Crusoe</hi>. Another feature of
<hi rend="italics">Jack the Giant Killer</hi> was <q>the Rifle Dance.</q> The
volunteers were just coming to the front, and this
was the first time that drill was suggested in the steps
of the <hi rend="italics">coryphees</hi>.</p>

        <div2 n="A VISIT TO THE PROPERTY ROOM" type="subchapter" id="s74"><head>A VISIT TO THE PROPERTY ROOM.</head>

  <p>And now, having talked quite long enough about
the past, I turn to a time of far more immediate
moment, the last of Harris's pantomimes. I was permitted to wander about Drury Lane at my own sweet
will, and follow the bent of my fancy. I shall never

<pb id="p.105" n="105"/>



forget the scene. The theatre was turned into a very
hive of industry. Business is invariably very brisk
in the front of the house, but just before the
production of the pantomime the work of behind
the scenes finds its way into the auditorium.
Work   was going   on  everywhere.   The  very
passages were filled with busy assistants in the
pantomime production. Here was a chorus practising a glee, there a part of a ballet practising a new
step under the direction of my excellent friend Mr.
D'Auban, and yonder a number of seamstresses hard
at work putting the finishing touches to some costumes. I made for the property room. I ascended
a number of stairs, and found myself near the sky.
All the work was done. The hundreds and thousands of <q>properties</q> required for the pantomime
were completed, and all that had to be done was to
take them to the stage and have them in readiness
for those who had to use them. There were plaster
moulds weighing hundred-weights, in which had been
cast the enormous oyster shells that were to figure in
some of the fairy scenes. There were all sorts and
conditions of-well, everything. Fairies' wings for
the transformation scene; animated gunpowder barrels for Guido's plot; heads of savages for Crusoe's
Island. If I were to attempt an inventory, I would
have to fill hundreds of pages of this volume.</p></div2>

             <div2 n="IN THE PAINTING ROOM" type="subchapter" id="s75"><head>IN THE PAINTING ROOM.</head>

   <p>I passed through a door, and then found myself in
the old painting room-there is another that has been
recently constructed. We were close upon Boxing
Night, so the distempering of the acres of canvas had
been nearly completed. The <q>talented assistants,</q>
as they used to be called in the old play-bills, were,
however, hard at work putting finishing touches to a
wonderful cloth representing London in the time of
the Georges.</p>
  <p> <q>Very busy, sir?</q> I asked one of these clever
young gentlemen.</p>
   <p><q> Very, indeed, sir,</q> was the reply; <q>but we are all
right. Sir Augustus never leaves anything to
chance. There is nothing behindhand with him.
We are generally prepared to produce a day or two
before our time, and that is the reason that (barring
accidents) there is never a hitch on a first night.</q></p>
   <p>I passed a <q>Merry Christmas</q> to my friend the
<q>talented assistant,</q> and we separated.
</p></div2>

       <div2 n="PREPARATIONS FOR THE BALLETS" type="subchapter" id="s76"><head> PREPARATIONS FOR THE BALLETS.</head>

   <p>And now as I came down the stairs that led to the
stage, I had an opportunity of learning some of the
reasons that probably were the cause of the manager's


<pb id="p.107" n="107"/>


great popularity. I peeped into one of the
dressing rooms now tenanted only by fine clothes
waiting to be worn at the dress rehearsal. These
neat apartments were a vast improvement upon the
rooms of the past-order, cleanliness and comfort
ruled supreme. And wherever I went I found the
same consideration on the part of <q>the direction</q>
for the happiness of <q>the company.</q> It is not
unnatural, consequently, that everyone should be
satisfied-County Council, Renters, and last, but
not least, the great British Public. And now I
found myself among the dresses. Scores of seamstresses were at work completing the costumes to be
worn in the great procession, giving the <q> History of
England in twenty minutes.</q> The display reminded
me of Planche's admirable work on things sartorial.
Here were the dresses of some half-a-dozen centuries,
correct to the minutest details. Besides these
elaborate adornments there were the most exquisite
fancies for a couple of the most elaborate ballets, to
say nothing of the <q>outer man</q> equipment for a
company numbering the greater part of a thousand
individuals! I was reminded of the interior of the
cave of Ali Baba, wherein the rather-too-free-traders
housed their merchandise. One room was crammed
full of the most expensive silks, satins, and brocades,
worth many guineas a yard. They were there
because they had been bought on the chance of

<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>



<q> their coming in useful some day.</q> And as a matter
of fact that <q>some day</q> invariably arrived. Sir
Augustus seemed to know intuitively the things that
would be wanted, and purchased them when and
where they could be got.</p>
  <p><q>You are very busy? </q> I suggested to a
bright-looking lady, who had kindly accompanied me at the
request of her superior officer, the queen of the
department. <q>You seem to have a number at
work ?</q></p>
  <p><q>You have not seen them all,</q> was the reply.
<q>Every room is full, and you will find dressmakers
cutting, contriving, and sewing in the auditorium.
You will find them in the passages, behind the circles,
and in every room that is not required for rehearsal.
But our work is nearly at an end-at least for the
pantomime. But when it is over we shall begin upon
something else.</q></p>
  <p>And I saw that my kind and courteous informant
was quite right. The passages and rooms had been
invaded. During December every inch of the
National Theatre, both before and behind the
foot-lights has to be devoted exclusively to the needs of
the pantomime.</p>
  <p><q>And the ballets will be fine? </q> I asked.</p>
  <p><q>About the finest we have ever done,</q> was the
answer. <q> The dances of the fishes under the sea will
be the talk of London. The hues are so delicate,

<pb id="p.109" n="109"/>


the designs so clever. I have never seen anything to
touch it.</q></p>
  <p>And   again repeating  my Yule-Tide greeting
(which made me feel in my fur-lined coat rather like
a premature Father Christmas), I walked into the
saloon. In one corner were a number of ladies trying
over a chorus; in another my friend Mr. D'Auban (to
whom I shall ever be grateful for putting into action
the quaint old tunes I discovered in the British
Museum proper to the time of the <q>Maske of
Flowers </q>) was giving a lesson to a lady who was to
dance a <hi rend="italics">pas de deux</hi>. I greeted my talented friend
with great cordiality, and found that, like everyone
else, he had been hard at work. Only that morning
he had devised a dance appropriate-of all things in
the world!-to animated newspapers! He had just
seen the dresses of his ballet of seventy ladies, and
was satisfied, too, that the combinations of colours
would be perfect.</p>
  <p><q>I have it all in my mind,</q> said Mr. D'Auban;
<q>and I expect to see a marvellous effect.</q></p>
  <p>And, having once more qualified for Santa Claus,
I took myself to the stage. Here, again, hard work
ruled supreme.</p>
</div2>
                <div2 n="READY TO BEGIN" type="subchapter" id="s77"><head>READY TO BEGIN.</head>

  <p>I have seen a large number of stage managers at
one time and another. I have been present at a



<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>


rehearsal of which Charles Kean has taken the direction, another which has been commanded by Mr.
Fechter, a third <q>bossed</q> by Mr. Sothern, a fourth
by Mr. F. C. Burnand, a fifth by Mrs. Kendal, a
sixth by Miss Mary Anderson, a seventh by Mr.
Coe, and an eighth by Sir Henry Irving; but I can
honestly declare that the late Sir Augustus Harris,
in my humble opinion, was, as a stage manager,
better than them all. He not only knew what he
wanted done, but knew how to do it. Moreover, he
had the power of making others see his points, and
causing them to adopt them. He could show at a
moment's notice <q>how everything should be done.</q>
If put to it he could give examples of all the passions
from amiability to an expression of the bitterest
revenge. And all his <hi rend="italics">employes</hi> knew this, and consequently believed in him implicitly. The late lessee
of <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> would have made an excellent
general. Of that I am sure. I have seen him play
the part of <q> Commander-in-Chief</q> as it had never
been played before. And he had, in the person of
Mr. Arthur P. Collins, an excellent <q>Chief of the
Stage Staff,</q> who, on the death of his friend, worthily
replaced him in the supreme control.</p></div2>

<p>A FEW years ago, amidst much rejoicing, the Imperial Institute was opened to the public.  There
seemed to be some doubt about its exact object, and
perhaps it is not quite right to call it a common (or
garden) exhibition.  That there was a magnificent
inaugural ceremony is patent to everyone who read
the descriptions in the daily papers. A vast number of seats were occupied by Fellows of the Imperial Institute, and I fancy that the qualifications for
Fellowship were what may be termed elastic. Still
it must be remembered that the Institute is not confined to India, Canada, and the Colonies, but extends
to Great Britain. <q>It seems to be the nearest approach to Federation at which we have arrived at
present, and H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (to whom
the idea, I believe, with justice is credited) is to be
congratulated upon having obtained the first move

<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>




towards what we all desire and all hope some day to
possess. If the Institute proves to be the
foundation-stone of a noble edifice that will become the admiration of the world, it will be far more valuable than
all the exhibitions the world has ever seen. There
is no reason why this should not occur. Forty years
ago who would have thought of such an institution?
The late <persName key="Albert">Prince Consort</persName> imagined a congress of nations in South Kensington, and it has been left to his
eldest son to originate a scheme on the same site that
is calculated to bind together all the subjects of the
<persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName>, be they at home or living <soCalled>beyond the seas.</soCalled>
Such an idea is full of the most glorious possibilities.
May they be realised.</q> So I wrote when the Institute was inaugurated, but recent events have proved
that my view of the future, to say the least, was
rose coloured. For all that, the Imperial Institute
assisted to create that cordial feeling of good fellowship that we find in existence between the Colonies
and the Mother Country at the end of the century.</p></div2>


<div2 n="STRAY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE GREAT ORIGINAL" type="subchapter" id="s79"><head>STRAY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE GREAT ORIGINAL.</head>

  <p>I have rather an indistinct recollection of the first
Exhibition. It was opened when I was a very small
boy indeed, and I am under the impression that my
father (who was favoured with an invitation to be
present, and whose season ticket I still possess) was

<pb id="p.113" n="113"/>




called upon to appear in Court dress. In those distant days the levee costume consisted of a snuffcoloured coat (with steel buttons, ruffles, and arrangement for a bag wig), an elaborately embroidered white
satin waistcoat, white satin breeches and stockings,
old-fashioned shoes, and steel-hilted sword, with pendant chain and a cocked hat. Nowadays, a man, if
he cannot boast a uniform as a Cabinet (or other)
Minister, soldier, sailor, militiaman, yeoman, or volunteer, wears a neat arrangement in black velvet-a distinct improvement upon the old costume. I rather
think there was a miniature frigate on the Serpentine,
from which was fired a royal salute. And I recollect,
as Colonel Sibthorp strongly opposed the erection of
the building on the ground in the Park immediately
opposite Knightsbridge Barracks on the score that it
would injure the trees, the Palace of Crystal was raised
to a height sufficiently lofty to include within its walls
a cluster of growing oaks. The architect was Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Joseph Paxton, the chief of the garden staff of the late Duke of Devonshire. No doubt
the coming knight took his idea of the conservatorylike aspect of his design from the glass at Chatsworth.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph was a great friend of Mark Lemon, the first
editor of the London Charivari, and was, I think, the
only <q>outsider</q> who was ever entertained at that
weekly banquet of wit and other excellent things, the
<hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> dinner. Then I remember that the streets in

<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>




the neighbourhood of the World's Show (which was
to secure peace for ever, and, as a matter of fact,
served as an overture to those stirring military dramas
the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny) were impassable. I recollect my mother giving a cabman
half-a-crown to drive her from one side of the Knightsbridge Road to the other, which was at the rate of
about a penny a foot. Then I call to mind a Chinese
junk which came up the Thames, and was ultimately
exhibited at a show called the Chinese Exhibition.
I am under the impression that the captain of this
junk was treated with great honour, and given a place
amongst the Ambassadors at the opening ceremony.
And I fancy that amongst the exhibits from some outlandish country was a hideous idol. The Government
of this outlandish country, upon receiving an official
invitation to send specimens of the produce of the
land, despatched all they had-a pair of native slippers and their god.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="FROM KNIGHTSBRIDGE TO SYDENHAM" type="subchapter" id="s80"><head>FROM KNIGHTSBRIDGE TO SYDENHAM.</head>

  <p>All the world knows that, after a struggle to retain
the Crystal Palace of <date value="1851">1851</date> on the site it originally
occupied, the structure was removed to Sydenham
and set up afresh. If my memory does not play me
false, the smaller transept at Upper Norwood is the
<q> old original </q> that used to face the barracks at Hyde

<pb id="p.115" n="115"/>


Park. Amongst other exhibits at Sydenham removed
from Hyde Park were two fountains, one of glass and
the other showing figures representing the four quarters of the earth. And was not the Wurtemberg collection also at Knightsbridge, and <q>the screen of
kings and queens ?</q> And of all the exhibitions that
have been held during the past half-century the dear
old Crystal Palace as it now exists has been the best.
We are so accustomed to its glories that we forget
their value. Think of the various courts, the Alhambra, the villa from Pompeii, the Egyptian and the
Greek. When fire destroyed one of the transepts,
the two huge figures of Memnon were lost in the
flames. They were never replaced, possibly because
the public takes more interest nowadays in variety
entertainments than in archaeological research. Still,
the Crystal Palace continues to flourish as the home
of the best music, the purest literature, and the
brightest art. <foreign lang="FR">Floreat!</foreign></p></div2>


      <div2 n="THE EXPOSITION OF 1862 AND AFTER" type="subchapter" id="s81"><head>THE EXPOSITION OF <date value="1862">1862</date> AND AFTER.</head>

  <p>The second International Exhibition was held in
<date value="1862">1862</date>-nearly forty years ago. It was designed by
an amiable officer of the Royal Engineers, and both
of its domes still exist at the Alexandra Palace on
Muswell Hill. It was not nearly as successful as its
predecessor, and when it closed there was a general


<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>



understanding that it would not be repeated. On the
shutters being put up there was a vigorous effort made
to secure the building for the nation. But sensible
people objected <q>that it really was quite too ugly,</q>
and the objection was sustained. On its site stands
the Natural History Museum, which as a structure is
certainly a great improvement on the original building.
Before it was pulled down the hall of the Exhibition
of <date value="1862">1862</date> was used for the holding of a grand fancy
bazaar in aid of the Home for Incurables. The Prince
and Princess of Wales were present, and two of the
features were fitted-up theatres. At the first of these
-Richardson's Show-was played a piece called
<hi rend="italics">The Siege of Seringapatam</hi>, by F. C. Burnand, in
which the author took a prominent part. He was supported by Oliffe (son of Sir Joseph, the founder of
Trouville and medical adviser to Napoleon III.),
Charles Hall (now Recorder of London), Matt Morgan (the artist), and many others. The rival theatre
was under the management of Lady Anne Sherson
(a relative of the Duke of Fife), and there was played
therein a burlesque drama called <hi rend="italics">The Port Admiral</hi>,
written by Mr. Thomas Gibson Bowles, M.P. The
author again played in his own piece, and was supported by the late Frank Marshall and myself.
During the <q>intervals</q> the rival companies used to
march round the building in the hope of attracting
audiences. Mr. Burnand appeared as a sort of

<pb id="p.117" n="117"/>



compromise between a field-marshal and a postilion, Mr.
Bowles as a British tar, Mr. Matt Morgan as a Spanish
bullfighter, and Mr. (now Sir) Charles Hall as an acrobat. Those (there were two of them) were pleasant
days indeed, and the Home for Incurables greatly
benefited by our charitable labours.</p></div2>


     <div2 n="THE BAZAARS OF THE EARLY SEVENTIES" type="subchapter" id="s82"><head>THE BAZAARS OF THE EARLY SEVENTIES.</head>

  <p>And now, leaving out of consideration the series
of home exhibitions that began with the Fisheries and
ended with the Colonies, or the Militaries and Navalries of a few years since, I come to the consideration
of a now half-forgotten specimen of the international
sort that flourished early in the seventies. It was held
in the galleries belonging to the Horticultural Society,
and the gardens of that useful, but not (then) very
prosperous institution were thrown in. The notion
was to encourage foreigners to bring their goods duty
free to England, and then, when they had got them
here, to actually sell them at a great reduction. This
transaction was very popular with the British public,
but it was not regarded with so much favour by
the British trader. The unfortunate proprietor of
premises, say in Regent Street or <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>, could not
behold with unmixed satisfaction a foreigner
under-selling him in what was really a gigantic bazaar. The
foreigner could offer a French clock for twenty shillings

<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>



-some 30 per cent. cheaper than the article as
displayed in the London shops. The British trader
had to pay for carriage, duty, house rent, and the rest
of it. The foreign <q>exhibitor</q> got his carriage paid
and his rent for nothing, so could afford to be liberal.
But his liberality was rather too much for the British
retailer.  A most useful body called the National
Chamber of Trade took the matter up, called an indignation meeting at Willis's Rooms, and the International Exhibitions on the bazaar principle disappeared for ever-or nearly ever.</p>

<p>I FANCY it is the fashion nowadays to suggest that
popular enthusiasm is on the wane about things
athletic. Some <q> hundreds of thousands less than the
average</q> go every year to see the Derby, and a
million or thereabouts annually steer clear of the towing path, when, according to the placards on the
Underground Railway (as the Metropolitan and
District used to be called until recently), <q>the crews
are on the river.</q> For all that and all that, during
the last weeks of Lent all England, Scotland, Ireland,
and Wales, to say nothing of India, Canada, and the
Colonies, are talking about <q>the boat race.</q> Everyone (more or less) has something to say about the
powerful, steady stroke of Oxford, and the quicker,
more catchy, less effective pull of the Cantabs. I
remember some years ago feeling prouder than I
have ever felt in my life when at the close of the

<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>



great race my friend the coach of the Oxford eight
singled me out for recognition and greeting as he
led his charges back in triumph to their quarters in
the Lyric Club at Barnes. But that moment is
replaced. I have beaten its record. It now ranks in
my memory as the second proudest moment of my
life. It is entirely effaced by the hour and a half's
delight I experienced only two or three seasons
since, when I had the honour of accompanying Mr.
R. C. Lehmann on board the <hi rend="italics">Swan</hi>, and watching the
practice of the Oxford crew. There was another
man on board, an old Oxford Blue, who took the
time. I was the solitary passenger. Three all told-
besides the crew. It was a unique experience, and
in spite of the pelting rain I had the most delightful
time imaginable. When it was over I came to the
conclusion that after all the editor of <q>Men and
Women of the Day </q> had shown his wisdom in adding
my otherwise insignificant name to the list of his
biographies in his useful and interesting volume. I
felt, when drenched and dripping I returned to the
Leander dressing-room, that I had at length established my right to be considered a celebrity. I had
actually seen the Oxford crew at close quarters-had
followed the boat neck and neck from Putney to
Barnes and back again! Since that time I have
become more than usually unsupportable to my
friends. When any of them say anything about the

<pb id="p.121" n="121"/>



boat race (and they talk more or less of nothing else
during Lent) I invariably contradict them.</p>
  <p><q>Yes, yes,</q> I murmur, <q>it is all very well. But
take my word for it that I am right-and I ought to
know, for a few seasons since I was on board the
Swan and saw the crews at practice.</q></p>
  <p>Then there is a silence. There is no answer.
What reply <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be made to a man who has seen
practice from the deck of the coach's launch? My
friends have given the question up. So have I. So
must everyone.</p></div2>


     <div2 n="COACHING A CREW A LA BOUCICAULT" type="subchapter" id="s84"><head>COACHING A CREW A LA BOUCICAULT.</head>

  <p>Until the occasion to which I refer I must confess
that I had very vague notions about the training of
a crew. I think if I had analysed, so to speak, my
memory I should have found in the residuum a
recollection of <hi rend="italics">Formosa</hi> at Drury Lane. To my
lasting regret I did not see the revival of Boucicault's
play a year or two ago at the National Theatre. My
friends and colleagues, the dramatic critics of <q>the
new school,</q> told me at the time that it was old-
fashioned, out of date, and the rest of it.  My
friends and colleagues are rather fond of that sort
of sweeping denunciation. It does not mean much.
It merely suggests that if they had to write such a
play nowadays they would write it very differently.

<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>



And no doubt they would. And the admission is
not calculated to lessen the reverence felt for the
memory of Dion <hi rend="italics">qua</hi> dramatist. But I saw <hi rend="italics">Formosa</hi>
when it was produced, and distinctly recollect an
ex-prize-fighter getting the Oxford crew to sit upon
chairs in a line and <q>go through the movement</q> of
rowing.  Then the ex-prize-fighter (who was the
coach) sang the crew a song, and the nine (for the
cox took part in the delightful recreation) joined in
the chorus. The daughter of the ex-prize-fighter (if
my memory does not play me false) exercised a
baleful influence over the stroke of the Dark Blues,
and that eminent athlete would have gone completely
to the bad had he not been pulled up at the last
moment by his <q>guide, philosopher, and friend,</q> the
Oxford steerer.</p>
  <p><q>Jack,</q> said the Dark Blue coxswain, <q>you must
be true to your 'Varsity. The public have put their
money on the Oxonians, and we must not betray
them! Your <foreign lang="LA">alma mater</foreign> expects you to do your
duty!</q></p>
  <p>Thus spoke the steerer, or words to the same effect.
Jack (I think the stroke was called Jack) became a
changed man from that moment. He gave up balls
down the river, was rescued by his colleagues from a
sponging house, and won the race shoulders square
and a straight back in a common paddle!</p>
  <p>Such was my preconceived notion of training an

<pb id="p.123" n="123"/>


eight. After my real experience I can confidentially
say, <q> it is not a bit like it.</q></p></div2>


       <div2 n="FROM  PUTNEY TO HAMMERSMITH" type="subchapter" id="s85"><head>FROM  PUTNEY TO HAMMERSMITH.</head>

  <p>I never remember a <q>wetter day</q> than the
occasion of my outing. It pelted at Putney, and even
the <foreign lang="FR">habitues</foreign> of the towing-path sought shelter under
the sheds of the boathouses. The dogs did not seem
to mind the downpour; they walked about as usual.
One of them (he was chained up) treacherously repaid
the kindly pat of my friend the coach by biting
the hand that caressed him. It was a wicked thing
to do, and I believe that canine public opinion
accepted the theory that the deceitful dog had been
carried away by his feelings, or, rather, his betting-
book. Those who know Dog Latin say that the
biter had a <q>bit on Cambridge,</q> and had, consequently, reasons <q>of his own</q> for attempting to incapacitate the coach of the Darker Blues. But the
dog was out in his calculations.  My friend the
coach, in spite of his accident and the frightful
weather, was as fit as a fiddle.</p>
  <p>I first entered the London Boating Club (where
the Oxonians put up), and had a glance at the photographs of boating men past and present; strolled
through the apartments devoted to <q>changing,</q>
weighing, and rubbing down, and got aboard the

<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>






Swan. My companions had waterproofs; I wore a
fur-lined coat.</p>
  <p><q> You should have scaled before embarking,</q> said
the Old Blue. <q> You will find that coat will put on
an extra stone of water before we get home.</q></p>
  <p>The Old Blue was right. But there was no time
for chaff. The crew had carried their ship from the
boathouse to the river and were afloat. They took
off their wraps and were ready to start. A few
directions and off we went, the Swan keeping just
in rear of the Oxford rudder. From that moment
there was a silence broken only by the voice of the
coach as he called out to this man and to that to
correct some fault.  When he was not giving a
particular direction he repeated a general instruction.
I was reminded of Wellington Barracks and the
sergeant-major in charge of the newly-joined subs.
My friend Mr. Lehmann was intently on the alert,
and so was the Old Blue, and so was I.</p>
  <p>As we passed along we had the banks of the
river to ourselves-not a soul to be seen anywhere.
But civilisation came within measurable distance as
we neared Hammersmith Bridge.    There were a
couple of omnibuses and a cab crossing.  As we
approached they pulled up sharp, and heads appeared
in all directions. It was against human nature to
proceed while the Oxford eight were in view. My
friend Mr. Lehmann shouted out a few directions,

<pb id="p.125" n="125"/>



and we shot the bridge in splendid style. Then he
called to the man in charge of the engine, <q>Once,</q>
and there was a solitary whistle. Then, <q>Twice,</q>
and we had two whistles. The crew slowed at the
first signal and stopped at the second.
  <q> Put on your wrap, Seven,</q> shouted Mr. Lehmann,
as he noticed that one of his charges (a freshman in
his first term) had forgotten to take the necessary
precautions to keep off chills. Then there was time
for a few minutes' chat and recreation.</p></div2>


          <div2 n="INCIDENTS OF A TRAINING" type="subchapter" id="s86"><head>INCIDENTS OF A TRAINING.</head>

  <p><q>Don't laugh at my ignorance,</q> said I, <q>but how
do they train? When do they begin it? </q></p>
  <p><q> On Ash Wednesday,</q> returned Mr. Lehmann.
<q>Up at seven in the morning, a spin before breakfast. Then tea and toast and a chop. Practice.
Lunch at 1.30, beef or mutton, watercress or salad.
Practice. Dinner at seven. Fish, a fowl <foreign lang="FR">entree</foreign>, beef
or mutton.  Two glasses of ale at luncheon, same
at dinner. One glass of port at end of the latter.
Bed at ten o'clock.</q></p>
  <p><q>And do you train with them ?</q> I asked.</p>
  <p><q>Certainly. I accompany them in their morning
spin. I am responsible for their being fit. If I see
anything amiss in any of my charges I march him off
to the doctor. However, they are all wonderfully

<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>





well, and we haven't had to call in medical assistance
so far.</q></p>
  <p><q> Except in your own case,</q> I said, pointing to the
bandaged hand peeping out of a sling.</p>
  <p><q> Oh, that's nothing,</q> he cried. <q>Now then, back
to work.</q></p>
  <p>We were off again. The coaching went on as
before. Stroke and Bow lead the boat betweep
them, the earnest little coxswain (covered up in
shining waterproof) occasionally giving the time. As
we neared Barnes Bridge we saw a luggage train
hasten up and stop in the centre of the structure.
The engine driver, stoker, and guards had a good
look at us. As we passed Thornycroft's the same
thing happened. Work was suspended that we might
be carefully inspected.  Officials and mechanics
formed together in groups to join in a common
criticism.  It was a link binding all Englishmen
together-the love of sport, of pluck, of a good fight
honourably fought.</p></div2>


       <div2 n="THE MORAL OF THE BOAT RACE" type="subchapter" id="s87"><head>THE MORAL OF THE BOAT RACE.</head>

  <p>We had been to the <q> Ship </q> at Mortlake, and were
returning to Putney with the tide. Just after leaving
the Barnes Bridge our crew were called upon to give
up <q>paddling</q> to have a row. Then they <q>let her
have it.</q> It was a splendid eight minutes.  My

<pb id="p.127" n="127"/>



friend, Mr. Lehmann, shouted out all sorts of cries
of encouragement. Now and again I heard the yells
of the hunting-field finding a place amongst the
echoes of the towing-path. It was a beautiful sight;
one never to be forgotten.  The boat sprang at
almost every stroke. The blades of the oars worked
like clockwork. The crew strove with the earnestness of Englishmen.</p>
  <p>And as I watched them I could not help feeling
that in the youngsters before me were the true germs
of the British race.  They were all good in the
schools, but it was something more that shone in the
bright good-looking faces of the heroes of the river.
I recognised in the men before me the stock from
which come the <q> V.C.'s</q> and the <q> D.S.O.'s.</q> There
was not a man amongst them, from the sturdy little
steerer up to gigantic No. 5, who would not have
held his own at Glencoe or shown Tommy Atkins
the way into the Redan at Sebastopol.   Here
before me were the descendants of the men who
had fought at Agincourt, Crecy, and Waterloo. And
here were they exhibiting the same fine old British
pluck that had carried their ancestors triumphantly
through the treacheries of the Peninsula and the
cruel mismanagement of the Crimea. Oh, it was a
grand sight! The sort of sight that makes one's
eyes glisten and one's heart beat a little faster at
the thought that the blood coursing through one's

<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>



veins was British born, and belonged exclusively to
the children of Britannia.</p>
  <p><q>What rot!</q> will say any of the crew or their
successors, who reads the above language, quoting
the immoral criticism of Lord Arthur Pomeroy.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Quite so, my good young friend,</q> I reply in
advance.   <q type="spoken">Certainly <quote>what rot!</quote> but the idea is
sound enough.</q></p>
  <p>And so it was. While our lads can row and live up
to rowing we need not fear for the Union Jack. It
will keep floating all the world over.
</p></div2>

  <p>We returned in triumph. We passed the Cambridge crew  shortly after Hammersmith.   They
glanced at us critically as we left them. And here
I may note that the best feeling of <foreign lang="FR">camaraderie</foreign> exists
between the rival Blues-it extends to the coaches
and all concerned. As a proof of this, take the case
of Mr. Lehmann. He is a Trinity Cambridge man;
was in reserve for the eight when up at Cambridge;
and yet he has been the Oxford coach. <q>Our friends
the enemy</q> are as popular as <q>our friends the
friends.</q> Before taking my leave, after the most
delightful of morning's recreations, I asked Mr.
Lehmann if the French were really beginning to
take up rowing seriously.</p>

<pb id="p.129" n="129"/>



  <p><q> Certainly,</q> he replied. <q> And if they extend the
movement, you take my word for it, it will change
the characteristics of the nation. They will prove
to be like Englishmen.</q></p>
  <p>And I believe they will. Well, if they do, and
invade us, we will tolerate them. A man who is
worthy to rank with an Old Blue is worthy of anything and anybody.</p>
  <p>And when I say this I do not fear contradiction
from the globe in general, and from the banks of
the Thames between Putney and Mortlake in
particular.</p></div2>

<p>A LONDONER usually pays a visit to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> to see the
Grand Prix. Not every Londoner, of course, but
very many who live within sound of the bells of
Cockayne.   Of late matters sporting have improved amongst <q>our lively neighbours</q> (who, by the way, what with their Anarchists, Communists,
Anti-Semites, and the like, are very frequently <q> our
sad neighbours </q>), but in spite of this improvement
there ever will be many strange turns-out. For instance, although many Frenchmen are now capable
of handling the ribbons and tooling a coach, yet the
typical Jules prefers, as a general rule, to have his
driving done for him. He likes to have a number of
friends, male and female, on his <q> veritable dragge,</q>
and then desires his coachman to mount. The hired
jehu appears in the costume of the Postillon de
Longjumeau and everyone (inclusive of the typical

<pb id="p.131" n="131"/>



Jules) is satisfied. Arrived on the course, <q>a veritable lunch, five o'clock,</q> is discussed. The typical
Jules and his friends, male and female, imitate the
<q>gentlemans and ladies sportismans</q> across the
Channel as well as they can, and are perfectly satisfied to get back to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> safely. The typical Jules is
merry, but the survival of the Postillon de Longjumeau is as sober as a judge. But whatever be the
method of the typical Jules, the fact remains that
<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>-yes, all <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>-is agog with excitement on the
occasion of the Grand Prix, and can think of nothing
but racing.</p>
</div2>

           <div2 n="RACING UNDER THE EMPIRE" type="subchapter" id="s90"><head>RACING UNDER THE EMPIRE.</head>

   <p>I suppose that, although the Duc d'Aumale was
 always fond of horse training, the great revival of
 French sport became an accomplished fact under the
 patronage of Napoleon III. The Emperor had a
 great love for <q>the noblest friend of man,</q> and did
 his level best to bring Epsom to Longchamps.
 During his long sojourn in England-when he was
 occupying that now-betableted house in <placeName key="King Street">King Street</placeName>,
 St. James's-the coming ruler of France was con tinually at the more frequented of the meetings. If
 he never took part in an actual race himself he at least
 entered in the lists of Eglinton Castle when the glories
 of Ashby-de-la-Zouch were revived, and some think

<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>





surpassed. The Emperor Louis Napoleon was the
first to render the June meeting at Longchamps
thoroughly popular. That popularity has now lasted
for something more than forty years. It has survived
the dark days of the Siege and the Commune, and
promises to be one of the features of the coming
twentieth century. The Grand Prix of the Republic
is not so very unlike the Grand Prix of the fifties and
the sixties. The State tribune is filled by the President, his wife, and the more illustrious of their guests,
and the classes and the masses are there-the first in
their hundreds and the last in their thousands. The
only absentee of to-day is the flower-girl of the
Jockey Club. <q> Isabelle,</q> some quarter of a century
ago, was an institution. It was her duty to appear
in the colours of the favourite, and to supply the
swells of the Jockey Club with button-holes. I
believe during the rest of the year she was the presiding genius of a newspaper kiosk on the Boulevards opposite the Grand Hotel. But during the
Sunday devoted to the Grand Prix she was the
heroine of Longchamps. Poor Napoleon III.  The
last time I saw him was lying in state at Chislehurst.
As I write, his pale, calm face comes back to me, his
iron-grey moustache and <q> imperial,</q> his scanty locks,
his apparently well-formed cranium. Only the other
day I saw a cast of his head taken by an eminent
surgeon immediately after death. The cast showed

<pb id="p.133" n="133"/>


a fine forehead, but my friend the eminent surgeon
suggested that, taken as a whole, the head was a
poor one. <q>It was the head of a dreamer,</q> said my
friend. <q> It belonged to a man infirm of purpose
and weak to a degree.</q> Well, Napoleon has long
since passed away, and so have <q>Isabelle,</q> Cora
Pearl, and Schneider, and the other glories of the
Empire.</p></div2>

     <div2 n="THE TURF IN THE FRENCH THEATRES" type="subchapter" id="s91"><head>THE TURF IN THE FRENCH THEATRES.</head>
  <p>The mention of that most clever and <foreign lang="LA">piquante</foreign> of
singer-actresses, Mdme. Hortense Schneider, reminds me that the great French public have never
cared for the racing drama. Only a year or so ago
a Drury Lane drama dealing with the Grand
National was transplanted to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, and although
staged to perfection under the direction of the late
Sir Augustus Harris, failed to prove very attractive.
I have been told by the author of the piece that the
manager of the theatre insisted upon the introduction into this play of <q> real modern life </q> of a <foreign lang="FR">ballet</foreign>
of clowns! And quite recently there was a French
<q> mimodrame </q> produced at the Princess's, in which
a <q>bookmaker</q> (presumably a <q>bookee</q>) was a
very prominent character. The <q>bookmaker</q> wore
a long light coat, a pair of field-glasses and a straw
hat. He was pressing in his attentions upon the
unprotected but virtuous heroine, to that lady's
<pb id="p.134" n="134"/>




indignation. However, upon the noble-minded maiden
stamping her foot and in dumb show <q>bidding him
begone,</q> the <q>bookmaker</q> politely lifted his straw
hat and made himself scarce. Beyond this I do not
think that there has been any very modern French
drama treating of the turf. Some years since I
remember seeing a play in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> (I fancy it must
have been at the Ambigu) in which there was a scene
laid on a racecourse. I have rather an indistinct
recollection of what it was all about, but I remember
that the course was kept by mounted British soldiers
(presumably Life Guards), and there was only one
policeman-and he an avowedly comic character. A
horse was brought across the stage, and received
with cheers and laughter. The play ended by the
hero, who was also a sailor, receiving a free pardon
(for something he had been accused of doing but
had not done), and the vote of the House of Commons. This was accorded him by a General, who
was called in the bills <q>Vellington,</q> and I supposed
must have been intended for the Victor of Waterloo.
I knew that it was a very wonderful performance
altogether, but fancy that the least effective part of
the piece was that which dealt with the racing.</p></div2>

        <div2 n="A RACE MEETING IN BRITTANY" type="subchapter" id="s92"><head>A RACE MEETING IN BRITTANY.</head>

  <p>Of course the meetings at <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> and other large
towns are not unlike our own sporting fixtures. But

<pb id="p.135" n="135"/>



when one travels further afield there is a marked
difference between racing at home and abroad.
Frenchmen  choose the  hottest months of the
summer for steeplechasing, and their example is
followed by the Germans. Not very long ago I was
visiting a town in Brittany where races had been
organised. The month was August, and the sport,
of course, steeplechasing. There were a number of
wretched screws entered for every race, and it was
absolutely a miracle how some of them surmounted
the various <q>obstacles</q> that barred the way to the
winning-post. There was a restive horse in one of
the contests, and this animal bolted. Immediately
a mounted gendarme started in pursuit, caught the
creature up, and brought it back in triumph! Fancy
such an affair occurring at Epsom! Fancy a
mounted policeman pursuing Flying Fox and
bringing him back! However, the spectators in
Brittany only laughed and cheered. The incident,
although not very novel, was evidently amusing.
</p></div2>

<div2 n="FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THE FIFTH LANCERS" type="subchapter" id="s93"><head>FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THE FIFTH LANCERS.</head>

 <p> But, in spite of the <q>sports </q> of the Empire and
the intelligent support of a new school of French
athletes, I do not think that racing will be popular
with our neighbours for a long time to come. If you
speak to a foreigner nowadays you will find that he

<pb id="p.136" n="136"/>


has lost some of his respect for the Lord Mayor, has
less regard for Leicester Square, and five times out
of six has heard of the Derby. However, the love
of horses is steadily gaining ground. Possibly taking
the idea from our Fifth Lancers and other cavalry
regiments, the Parisians have started an amateur
<foreign lang="FR">cirque</foreign>. It is quite the mode, and excessively <foreign lang="FR">chic</foreign>.
There is not only excellent horsemanship, but now
and again fairly amusing fooling. So far the <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>
<foreign lang="FR">cirque</foreign> is unique, but as the French officers are the
chief performers it is not unlikely to prove the parent
of many similar institutions.
</p></div2>

          <div2 n="FROM PARIS TO ISLINGTON" type="subchapter" id="s94"><head>FROM <placeName key="Paris">PARIS</placeName> TO ISLINGTON.</head>

  <p>But, if the Parisians have got as far as following
the Fifth Lancers, they have yet to learn the benefits
of the Military Tournament at the Agricultural Hall.
And yet, strange to say, although there is nothing
like our Assault-at-Arms to be seen in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, one of
the features at Islington has evidently been suggested
by a well-known item in the old-time programme at
the Hippodrome. In the days of the Crimean War
the entertainment invariably concluded with a
military sketch. The <q>Siege of Silistria</q> was extremely popular in the fifties, and this <q>spectacle</q>
(which I witnessed as a very small boy) was brought
back to my mind at the end of the century, as I

<pb id="p.137" n="137"/>




watched the incidents of the Display of Combined
Arms.   In the <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> Hippodrome there was a
sort of plot; at Islington there is nothing of
the kind.  The <q> Siege of Silistria,</q> I remember,
used to conclude with the entrance of the
British Army (about twenty all told), containing  detachments of "veritable Lif Gars" and
<q>veritable iglanders,</q> the whole under the command
of <q>le Prince Albert.</q> The <q>Lif Gars</q> wore a
miscellaneous lot of assorted helmets, and the
<q> iglanders</q> appeared in baggy fleshings. However,
the British army was received with effusion, which
grew in volume as <q>God Save the <persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName></q> was
played by the orchestra, and culminated in the
wildest enthusiasm when the tune changed to
<q>Partant pour la Syrie.</q></p>
  <p>And now, like the horses at the end of a race, I
must pull up. However, before quitting the subject
of this chapter, I cannot help recording the opinion
of a noted English athlete, who, speaking of the love
of sport in France, said to me the other day, <q> It is
steadily making progress, and gradually changing the
national characteristics. When the French love
sport as much as we do they will understand us
better, and the Channel will become nothing more
serious than a geographical expression.</q></p>
  <p><q>Yes,</q> I replied, <q>except to those who have to
cross it on a rough day.</q></p></div2>

<p>DURING the <q>silly season </q> (and even later) the
condition of our cabs is discussed in the columns of the
London Press. From this I take it that interest in
road-travelling is reviving-the more especially as
every now and again there is an <q> indignation meeting </q>
of cabmen to protest against something or other
-and consequently a few hints as to how it is done
at the end of the century may be acceptable. But

       <div2 n="PARIS VOITURES AND LONDON CABS" type="subchapter" id="s96"><head>PARIS <foreign lang="FR">VOITURES</foreign> AND LONDON CABS.</head>

  <p>The French <foreign lang="FR">coupe</foreign> is smarter than the London
  four-wheeler; but I am not sure that the Victoria is
  preferable to the hansom. The Parisian jehus seem to be
suffering under a chronic grievance.  They never

<pb id="p.139" n="139"/>


smile and seldom speak.  When they have a fare
their chief object in life seems to be to commit
manslaughter by driving over some absent-minded
pedestrian. Thanks to the asphalte, it is not difficult to
kill a foot passenger. All you have to do is to
make for him, and, if he does not clear out
of the way, go over him.   The omnibus drivers
are more merciful, and of the two would rather
save a pedestrian than kill him.  Indeed, I have
seen a driver of a tramcar absolutely pull up
rather than run down a lady and a family of four!
But it is only fair to add that the driver was
regarded as <q>eccentric</q> by his <foreign lang="FR">confreres</foreign>. It may be
as well to know what to do in the case of coming
across a too-insolent cabdriver. The last time I was
in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> I hailed a Victoria and told the coachman
that I wished to take him by the hour. He protested
loudly, but submitted. I was accompanied by my
better seven-eighths, and soon discovering that the
amiable lady was a trifle nervous, the indignant jehu
drove into everything. We charged omnibuses, collided
with tramcars, and attempted to cross over vans.
At my urgent entreaties my better seven-eighths
preserved her <foreign lang="FR">sang froid</foreign>.  Finding that the
Dick-Turpin's-ride-to-York kind of progress did not trouble
us, the coachman adopted other tactics. He made
his horse walk at the pace of a weary steed at a
congested State funeral. We took fully a quarter of an

<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>

hour to get across the Place de la Concorde, and ten
minutes to pass the Hotel Meurice in the Rue de
Rivoli. Then, finding we still were patient, he stopped
his horse altogether before the Louvre and put on
the nosebag. It was then I protested.</p>
  <p>The man treated my complaint with contempt.
While we were in altercation a <q>guardian of the
peace</q> passed. I appealed to the law as represented
in his person. In a moment the <q>guardian of the
peace </q> was mounted on our box, and we were driving
at a smart pace to the nearest cabstand. The <foreign lang="FR">sergent</foreign>
descended, and introduced me to another policeman.
A book was produced from a kiosk, and I was requested
to insert a narrative of my wrongs. It was
then that I regretted that apathy shown about the
acquisition of the French language, which, alas! is a
characteristic at our public schools. But my better
seven-eighths came to my rescue, helped me with my
irregular verbs, and generally superintended my grammar.
The story was told in French of varying
quality.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">And now, monsieur,</q> said the commissaire, <q type="spoken">as
we have your name and address, you will be warned
when your evidence is required at the trial. You will
please be in the way, and give the porter at your
hotel particulars of your movements.</q></p>
  <p>I was horrified! What had I done?  During the
rest of my two days in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> I was in terror lest I

<pb id="p.141" n="141"/>


should be called. Fortunately the machinery of the
law was slow, and I made my escape.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="FROM THE CAB TO THE POLICE COURT" type="subchapter" id="s97"><head>FROM THE CAB TO THE POLICE COURT.</head>

  <p>But to return to London.   People have grown
so accustomed to the rules and regulations anent cabs
that they have forgotten them. This seems rather
like an Irishism, but it is substantially correct. I have
not looked into the Act or the bye-law keeping the
Cockney jehu in order for a very long while, but I
fancy that every cabman should, upon the application
of his hirer, produce a list of his fares and also supply
a ticket. As the latter custom has entirely ceased it
may have been abandoned. However, it is worth
noting that when there is a dispute about a fare the
hirer can request the coachman to drive him to the
nearest police-station, where the matter can be arranged. As a rule the jehu prefers to grumble and
depart. If he is not too abusive this is as it should be.</p>
  <p>I must confess I cannot recommend summoning a
cabman. I know, of course, that everyone owes it
to society to take steps to protect his fellow-man, and
particularly his (if I may use the expression)
fellow-lady from the danger of insult and over-charge. But
for all that I prefer to leave a police-court severely
alone. And for this entirely selfish reason. Many
years ago a cabman was so indignant at receiving


<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>



about a shilling more than his proper charge that
before driving away he struck at me with his whip.
I was a lad in those days in my teens, and remember
the exact date. It was on the first night of Fechter
as <q> Hamlet </q> at the Princess's. Well, I determined
to summon the man (fortunately, or unfortunately,
I had secured his number), and I carried out my
vengeful intention.  The result was that I had to
hang about the court until the time arrived for the
hearing. When it did arrive, the man never appeared,
and in his stead came a miserable-looking wife and
two small children. The husband and father was ill.
The magistrate, at my earnest request, granted a
remand. I felt deeply touched-I was very young
in those days. When the case was again called-a
week later-the man appeared, pale and careworn,
and explained that his wife and children were laid
up. He was most miserable, and asked for mercy.
I seconded his efforts to the best of my ability,
giving my evidence reluctantly and as a hostile witness
to myself. By the aid of these tactics he and I
managed to get the defendant off with the infliction of
a small fine. Personally, I was delighted the fine was
a small one, as ultimately I paid it myself. However, I was rewarded for my trouble by the penitent
cabman thanking me with tears in his eyes, and courteously intimating that he saw no reason why I
should not call myself a gentleman. Previously his

<pb id="p.143" n="143"/>





language had suggested that, whatever I might think
myself, he had serious doubts as to the validity of
my claims to rank with the lowest order of chivalry.</p></div2>


           <div2 n="A GRAIN OR TWO OF CHAFF" type="subchapter" id="s98"><head>A GRAIN OR TWO OF CHAFF.</head>

  <p>And when I hint that harshness is sometimes
the necessary medicine for rudeness, I would add that
kindness is, when possible, the better remedy. As
a body of men cabmen are an excellent set of fellows.
Considering that they have to be out in all weathers
and at all times, they really are wonderfully
good-tempered. That they are past-masters of chaff is
universally allowed.  The other day a friend of mine
took a cab a journey which extended to within some
three hundred yards of two miles.  He gave the
driver a shilling. <q> Beg your pardon,</q> said the man,
<q>but do you mind my driving you to next door? <hi rend="italics">I
want to complete the full distance!</hi></q>  On another
occasion a middle-aged man, after emerging from
Lock's in a brand new <foreign lang="FR">chapeau</foreign>, gave eighteenpence to
a coachman who had carried him from St. James's
Street to Sloane Square.</p>
  <p><q> Quite right, sir, I have no doubt,</q> said cabby;
<q>and if sixpence <hi rend="italics">should</hi> be due to me, oblige me by
keeping it towards getting a genteeler 'at! </q>
The man had his joke, but not his <q> extra tanner.</q>
Since the establishment of shelters I have noticed

<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>


a marked improvement in the sobriety of our jehus.
Even intoxication, however, on occasions has its advantages-a sentiment which, no doubt, would meet
with the stern reprobation of Sir Wilfrid Lawson.
In advance of this contention, perhaps, I may instance
what occurred on a recent occasion. There was a
hurricane in London. It was simply terrible. I was
coming home from a newspaper office, and could not
see a cab anywhere. At length, about half a mile
from <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, I stumbled upon a four-wheeler.
The driver was cheerful and quite tipsy. He made
not the slightest difficulty to driving me some three
or four miles in a westerly direction. I do not believe
that he would have objected to attempting to get to
Aldershot, Margate, or, if it comes to that, India,
China, or Japan. We were a little tardy in starting,
as my coachman thought it necessary to tell me a long
anecdote about nothing in particular through the window. Then a policeman interfered, and ordered him
to <q>drive on.</q> The cabman was exceedingly polite
to the constable, and off we went. At first we took
the pavement a little too much, but later on proceeded
excellently well, Jehu leaving matters in the hands,
or rather legs, of the horse. I am glad to say our
well-trained steed was evidently a teetotaler. After
some short cuts that I fancy must have been favourites
with the worthy brute (I refer to the quadruped), we
reached our destination. I paid the cabman his fare,

<pb id="p.145" n="145"/>





and remarked that <q>it was a storm! </q>   <q>What
storm?</q> asked the man indistinctly and smilingly.
He had evidently not noticed the inclemency of the
weather.</p>
  <p><q> Are you sure you will get home all right?</q> I repeated two or three times.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">'Corse!</q> returned Jehu at last with dignified
amiability. <q type="spoken">Sammy knows 'way better than I do! </q>
  And then Sammy starting off, I saw no more of
either of them.</p></div2>

       <div2 n=" CABS FOR BETTER OR WORSE" type="subchapter" id="s99"><head> CABS FOR BETTER OR WORSE.</head>

  <p>Taken all round, our cabs and our cabmen are not
unsatisfactory. The men are cheerier than a number
of their foreign contemporaries. They are, as a rule,
civil and obliging; as for the cabs, in spite of the
complaints about the hansoms, there are no better
vehicles for the public in the world. The <q> London
gondola</q> is exactly suited to Londoners. Victorias,
well enough in the summer, would be impossible in
the winter. As to the <q>growler,</q> several specimens
of this type of conveyance are far from bad. There
are worse four-wheeled conveyances on the Continent
than in London. But it is only right to add, <q>not
many.</q>   However, we might go farther and fare
worse, and with this rather half-hearted benediction
I reserve further remarks about cabs and cabmen for
my next chapter.</p></div2>

<p>DURING the last few years the public have had a
practical experience of the inconvenience attendant
upon a body of working men <q> going on strike.</q> As
a rule Londoners do not come face to face with
artisans who have abandoned toil. Generally they
read of a cessation of labour in the daily papers, and
discover the result of the cause in the increased
charges for coal, gas, and other necessaries. However,
not long since, the Cockney mind was concerned
by the vagaries of cabby. The streets were deserted
by hansoms, and even the four-wheeler was difficult
to find. In spite of this, none of the body politic
were much the worse. Sufficient for the day were
the growlers thereof, and no one was at a loss to
secure (when really necessary) that particular kind of
conveyance which years ago used to be known as a
<q> patent safety.</q> So the nuisance of the suspension

  <p>Strikes are more or less a modern invention. In

be the foe, and the most popular mode of meeting
the enemy was to utterly demolish the offending
apparatus. Things are changed since then, although
even now the tradition lingers upon the stages of
theatres devoted to melodrama. And here, as I have
mentioned things histrionic, I may refer to <hi rend="italics">The Long
Strike</hi>, which was produced at the Lyceum by the
late Mr. Dion Boucicault some while after the success
of <hi rend="italics">The Colleen Bawn</hi>. No doubt Mrs. Dion Boucicault (who was in the cast) will remember it. There
was one scene in it which was immensely effective,
but which would have been more effective still had
the telephone been then invented.  I have the
vaguest recollection of the play's plot, but I call to
mind that it was necessary for some one or other to
be stopped from sailing from Liverpool. I fancy the
some one or other was a missing witness required to
save the hero's life or the heroine's reputation. The
scene was a telegraph office. Enter the friend of
the hero or heroine (as the case may have been),
who asks the telegraph clerk if he can be put into

<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>




communication with the operator at the other end.
There is some delay, as the operator has to be found
-he was on the point of leaving the office for the
night. But soon he is at his post. Then comes the
great effect. <q> Has the <hi rend="italics">Star of the North</hi> (or whatever the ship was called) started?</q>  <q>Yes.</q> <q>Is
So-and-so  on  board?</q>   <q>Yes.</q>   <q>Can he be
brought back?</q> <q>Only   by  signal.</q>  <q>Signal
for him, then.</q> <q>We have.</q> <q>Does the ship see
the signal ? </q> <q> Yes; and So-and-so is coming back.</q>
This was the climax, and on a grateful cry of <q>Saved,
saved! </q> the curtain fell amidst thunders of applause.
Had Boucicault had the assistance of the telephone
in those days how   much <q>sharper</q> would the
dialogue have been. There was an air of unreality
in the working of the needles, but with a telephone
it would have been perfect. I wonder what has
become of <hi rend="italics">The Long Strike</hi>. Is it ever played
now-a-days?  As Mr. Tree says in <hi rend="italics">The Red Lamp</hi>, <q>I
wonder.</q> And here I may recount a little anecdote
that is interesting, when we remember that Mrs.
Boucicault is still amongst us. I was editor of <hi rend="italics">The
Glowworm</hi> in those days, and I called upon Dion
Boucicault at the Lyceum, and saw him in his dressing-room.
I was arranging for a <foreign lang="FR">feuilleton</foreign>, and
thought he might write <q> us</q> a story. He suggested
novelizing <hi rend="italics">The Flying Scud</hi>, and novelized it was
with the collaboration of the late Mr. Clarke, author

<pb id="p.149" n="149"/>




of <q>Charlie Thornhill.</q> I was standing behind a
screen, when, unsuspicious of my presence, Mrs.
Boucicault entered and said she wanted to intercede
for one of the company who had been fined (Dion
was a strict disciplinarian) for some breach of the
rules. I shall never forget the sweet kindness of
Mrs. Boucicault's pleading accents. Possibly with a
wish to terminate the interview as quickly as possible
the husband yielded, and Mrs. Boucicault departed,
overjoyed at the success that had attended her
mission. When she had left the room I emerged
from my accidental ambush, and continued the
negotiation about <hi rend="italics">The Glowworm feuilleton</hi>.</p>
  <p><q>That is a woman in a thousand, sir,</q> said the
author of <hi rend="italics">The Long Strike</hi>. <q>She has a heart of
gold.</q></p>
  <p>And I agreed with him.</p></div2>


        <div2 n="ON STRIKE WEST AND EAST" type="subchapter" id="s102"><head><q>ON STRIKE</q> WEST AND EAST.</head>

  <p>And as I am talking of things theatrical I may
mention that some twenty years ago I wrote myself
a domestic drama (I called it on the playbill <q>a social
problem </q>), with the title of<hi rend="italics"> On Strike</hi>. If I may be
permitted to criticise my own work, I may say it is
not a bad little play, and was a great success when
produced at the old Court Theatre. The cast included Messrs. Edgar Bruce, J. G. Hill, Walter

<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>

Fisher (Husband of Miss Lottie Venne),Mrs.
Stephens, and Mr. Alfred Bishop.  It was distinctly
written for the classes.  The agitator was held up to
scorn, and the working man, who played rather than
laboured, to reprobation.  However, it is a fact that
when Miss Lytton's company went on tour, the
aristocratic sentiments were more heartily cheered
at the Standard, Shoreditch, than at the old Court
Theatre in Sloane Square.  The East-enders were
just as much opposed to the loafing-do-nothing as
their brothers of the West.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="CABBY ON STRIKE IN '94"><head>CABBY ON STRIKE IN '94</head>

	<p>To come to the strike that occurred five years ago.
It commenced hurriedly.  As a rule the Union of the
trade or calling proposing to cease work takes some
weeks to prepare for the operation.  To be successful
the strike must be general and hearty, and there
must be sufficient funds in hand to support the
strikers for at least a month or two.  On the occasion
to which I refer, the Union was scarcely in existence
before it was called upon to conduct a very delicate
negotiation.  Then the cabmen, as a class, were never
heartily in favour of the association.  To say the
least, opinions were divided.  Then there seemed to
be a very slenderly furnished fund available for
paying the strikers, and lastly, there was no effort


<pb id="p.151" n="151"/>


made to collect funds sufficient in amount to make
good deficiencies.  Under these circumstances,
considering that the cab proprietors or masters were
represented by a very strong and compact organisation,
the prosects of the drivers seemed anything
rather than rose-coloured.</p></div2>


<div2 type="subchapter" n="CABBY ON THE SITUATION"><head>CABBY ON THE SITUATION</head>

	<p>One evening during the strike, as I was ordered
to be <q>in attendance upon the ladies of my family</q>
during a visit to one of the theatres, I seated myself
next to the cabdriver in his box.  This arrangement
allowed me to smoke and to collect information.</p>
	<p><q>How about the strike?</q> I asked.</p>
	<p><q>A bad thing all around, sir,</q> replied the driver;
<q>it don't affect me as I drive my own cab, but it hits
a lot of men who would work if they were allowed to.</q></p>
	<p><q>Who's in the wrong?</q></p>
	<p><q>Well, I take it both, sir.  It's very hard to make
a living sometimes.  I have known pals of mine for
three days running not make a single penny for
themselves.  Yes, have to borrow money to make up
the sum charged for the cab.  Then, at other times,
they have a lot of money by five o'clock and
gone home, after taking back their cab to the yard,
cozily to tea.</q></p>
	<p>This seemed in the mind of my friend to be the
height of luxury.</p>


<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>



  <p><q type="spoken">But what I most object to,</q> continued Jehu, <q type="spoken">is
those swells going into business. I hear two young
gentlemen in the Guards have started a couple of
cabs. Or rather they would have done, but just as
they were ready with stables in Pimlico, up comes
the strike and spoils their little game!</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">But are there not too many drivers?</q> I asked.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Yes, sir,</q> was the response. <q type="spoken">That's where it
comes in.   Anyone can be a driver nowadays.
<q>How would you go from Charing Cross to Ludgate
Circus?</q> they ask at the Yard. <q>By the Embankment.</q>
<q>Right you are-give him a licence.</q> That's
how it's done, sir, and that's why there are so many
of us.</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Do you think the masters make excessive
profits?</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Well, sir, it looks like it. I know a man with
only a couple of cabs two years ago, and now he's
got thirteen. And they were all bought out of the
profits on the letting of the first couple. Now some
of them pay 20 per cent., and surely that's too much,
isn't it, sir?</q></p>
  <p>I did not answer. The driver was a sensible
fellow and spoke with great moderation. Speaking
personally, I repeat that I have always found the
driving brotherhood a most civil and obliging class.
For some years, when I was editing a weekly
newspaper, a driver always turned up early on a

<pb id="p.153" n="153"/>




Sunday morning at Bouverie Street and waited for
me until I was ready to be driven by him to the
Belgrave Road. Sometimes he waited more than an
hour, and for this accommodation I only paid him,
by his own request, a shilling more than his bare
fare. And if I had listened to him, sixpence would
have been sufficient, but I preferred, in the cause of
justice, to pay the shilling. And when he was away
he always sent a substitute, who cheerfully adopted
the arrangement. I dare say many journalists could
tell a similar story.</p>
  <p>From this I take it that cabmen are not overpaid,
and whether they are or not, I wish them a satisfactory outcome from any difficulties that may be
looming for them in the future.</p></div2>

<p>DURING the last quarter of a century it is a perfect
mercy that London has not been burned to the
ground. On more than one occasion recently, a
single fire has drawn all the available resources to
its centre, to the terrible danger of the remainder of
the metropolis. According to the report of the Chief
Officer who has taken the place of my gallant but
retired friend, Captain Sir Eyre Shaw, it has been a
perfect mercy, not to say a miracle, that the Great
Fire of London has found no parallel in modern times.
Over and over again we have been within an ace of
seeing the great city reduced to ashes. Under these
circumstances it may not be entirely out of place to
devote a chapter to fires and how  to extinguish
them. It is certainly a matter that, for the safety of
the public at large and Londoners in particular,
should be carefully considered. The method should
be acquired-the thing should be done.</p>

<pb id="p.155" n="155"/></div2>


     <div2 n="FIRE BRIGADES AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS" type="subchapter" id="s104"><head>FIRE BRIGADES AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</head>

  <p>There used to be an expression much in vogue
years ago that denoted the instruction of the
juvenile-it was <q type="spoken">teaching the young idea how to
shoot.</q> When I was a lad at school my head master,
who was distinctly a man of notions, insisted upon
the boys learning something about fires. In those
days the appliances for extinguishing conflagrations
(especially in the country) were of the simplest
character. Felsted had no large town near it, within
a radius of some six miles, and practically consisted
of little more than the school. There was a village
with a few shops, but the school overshadowed
everything else with its handsome range of buildings,
its chapel, its property in every direction. And the
place, to the best of my belief, did not possess a fire
engine. So when there was an alarm of fire in the
neighbourhood (a not infrequent occurrence when
quarter day was nigh in hard times, and farm
labourers and their masters were discontented) we
lads used to turn out <foreign lang="FR">en masse</foreign> and hurry to the site
of the blaze under the direction of the masters. We
used to form into a double row of water bearers, the
two ends resting one on the bank of the nearest pond,
one close to the blazing building. The buckets used
to be passed from hand to hand full and returned


<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>



empty. It was very primitive but not ineffective.
Some of the pupils used to throw the water on the
fire itself and became in time capital amateur
<foreign lang="FR">pompiers</foreign>. Over and over again have I partaken of
the cakes which were sent to the school as some
slight sign of grateful acknowledgment for services
rendered.</p>
</div2>

      <div2 n="FIRE DRILL FOR THE YOUNGSTERS" type="subchapter" id="s105"><head>FIRE DRILL FOR THE YOUNGSTERS.</head>

  <p>And here it may be asked, why should not fire drill
be taught at every school in the kingdom? Not
only at the public schools but the board schools, and
even at the infant schools. Children cannot commence too early to learn how to do a thing, and this
is a matter of very great importance. And I would
not make a distinction between the sexes. Why
should not girls learn as well as boys? In a fire
everyone should be of use, and if a girl is not strong
enough to carry a bucket or draw along hose, she
can at any rate learn to make herself valuable as a
messenger or a signaller. Of course it is immensely
important that there should be discipline, and fire
drill like all other drills conduces to discipline. So
even from this point of view it would be a most
valuable institution.</p></div2>

        <div2 n="WHY NOT ENGLISH POMPIERS?" type="subchapter" id="s106"><head>WHY NOT ENGLISH POMPIERS?</head>

  <p>I believe that volunteer firemen are very numerous
in America, and we see large numbers of
them in England. The object of the movement is
of course admirable, and consequently it is a thousand
pities that sometimes discredit is thrown on the
force by the collection of subscriptions by persons
whose claims to distinction are (to put it mildly) of
an extremely slender character. It would be well if
volunteer firemen could be put on the same footing
with volunteer riflemen. In France and other countries
they are treated as soldiers, and on emergency
can be used as a military force. If the War Office
could see its way to accepting the services of the
English <foreign lang="FR">pompiers</foreign>, and granting commissions to their
officers, the scandals to which I have incidentally
referred would disappear and become at once impossible.
At the present moment the discipline of
the various brigades is purely self-imposed. To become
thoroughly effective the force require more than
this, and the man who adopts my suggestion and
works out the idea successfully will assuredly deserve
well of his country. He will cover himself with distinction,
and no doubt be offered a knighthood. As
an alternative suggestion, why not make volunteers
themselves <foreign lang="FR">pompiers</foreign>?  It would be an addition to


<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>




their duties that should not be, and I venture to say
would not be, unpopular.</p></div2>

   <div2 n="A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN AND THE L.C.C." type="subchapter" id="s107"><head>A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE LORD
          CHAMBERLAIN AND THE L.C.C.</head>

  <p>At one time fires in London theatres were of frequent occurrence. There is scarcely a playhouse in
London that has not been burned down twice or
thrice. But of late years very few London theatres
have fallen a victim to the flames. I think we may
take it for granted that the much abused but occasionally useful London County Council has had
something to do with bringing about this satisfactory
result. The Lord Chamberlain, too, has had his say
about the matter with good effect. Some little while
ago I had personal experience of the zeal of both
parties. In <date value="1887">1887</date> a theatrical entertainment with
which I was connected had been given by invitation
in the Hall of Gray's Inn. As it was, of course, a
gratuitous performance no one could interfere with
us-and by <soCalled>us</soCalled> I mean the Members of the Hon.
Society of Gray's Inn. A few years later it was proposed to repeat the performance in the Hall of the
Inner Temple, but, on this occasion, for a charitable
object. Money having to be received at the doors
it was necessary to get a licence. There was a long
discussion as to whom had the right to grant the
licence. The Lord Chamberlain insisted it should be

<pb id="p.159" n="159"/>





the London County Council, the London County
Council repudiated the power and suggested the
Lord Chamberlain. Ultimately, after an opinion
upon the subject had been obtained from the Law
Officers of the Crown, the Lord Chamberlain remained master of the field. It was decided that I
should apply for and hold the licence. I made the
application, but the late lamented Lord Lathom refused to grant it until I had obtained a certificate
from the surveyor of the London County Council
stating that the Inner Temple Hall was suitable for
a theatrical performance, and reasonably safe from
any danger of fire. The London County Council
behaved most courteously (which was the more
creditable as the Press had been abusing them under
the impression that they had been putting obstacles
in the way of our performance), and lent us their
surveyor. That official was also a most amiable
gentleman, and after condemning a gallery here, and
ordering a door to be unhinged there, gave me the
necessary certificate. I got the licence and the performances were a great success. And we did not
lose the use of the gallery after all, for it was the
opinion of those learned in the law that it might be
used for those who had not paid for admission. So
it was placed at the service of friends of the performers, and other privileged personages. From this
it must not be imagined that I (who was primarily

<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>



responsible for the arrangement) thought the place
unsafe. As a proof to the contrary, I may say that
I was there myself when not engaged on the stage,
and so was my noble and learned colleague the Lord
Chancellor.</p>
</div2>
    <div2 n="THE GREAT FIRE IN THE OLD BAILEY" type="subchapter" id="s108"> <head>THE GREAT FIRE IN THE OLD BAILEY.</head>

  <p>In the old days, when the headquarters of the
London Fire Brigade used to be in Watling Street,
I was a frequent visitor to the apartments of Sir Eyre
Shaw. The late Chief Superintendent was in the
habit of allowing some of his friends to act as volunteers, and on more than one occasion I was of the
number. In those days every man in the force was
a sailor, with the solitary exception of the driver of
the captain's cart. All the men were teetotalers.
Since Sir Eyre resigned my connection with fires has
been extremely limited. The last I attended was
two or three years ago.  I had been dining in
Bouverie Street at a famous literary dinner, when
there was a cry that a fire had broken out in the
neighbourhood. The sparks were floating over
Bouverie Street and falling in the roadway. An
artistic colleague of mine volunteered to come with
me, and we started for the scene of conflagration.
We found the block of buildings close to the Old
Bailey and Ludgate Hill <q>well ablaze.</q> My ticket
as a Member of the Institute of Journalists passed

<pb id="p.161" n="161"/>




us through the cordon of police, and we might have
gone anywhere and seen anything. The fire was got
under after awhile, but not quickly enough to satisfy
my artistic colleague.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Had it been in America,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">they would
have put it out in less than no time. But here, they
have got no water-towers over here! </q></p>
  <p>From which I took it that water-towers must be
something particularly choice in the shape of fire
extinguishers.</p></div2>

            <div2 n="PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS" type="subchapter" id="s109"><head>PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS.</head>

  <p>In conclusion, it seems to me that not only do we
require an increased Brigade under the London
County Council (that is admitted) but also organisation
for auxiliary assistance. There is no reason
why volunteer firemanships should not be as popular
in England as in America. There is plenty of pluck
among Britons, and the fireman who is worth his
salt must have a fair share of that excellent (may I
call it?) quality. Discipline, coolness, and courage
are all to be had for the asking. So the sooner the
Government begins to work up the raw material into
the requisite composition, the better will it be for the
nation in general and the metropolis of that nation in
particular.  The Fire Brigade is still in want of
further development at the end of the nineteenth
century.</p></div2>

  <p>The first idea of the sort was (I fancy) associated
with the camp of Chobham a short while before the
Crimean War. Until then we had no thought of
tactics, and even the great Duke of Wellington
expressed his doubts about the possibility of getting ten
thousand men in or out of the Park via Hyde Park
Corner. Nowadays, the heroes of a hundred fights
would be greatly astounded to see the ease with which

<pb id="p.163" n="163"/>



the unemployed invade the Row and <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>. If
the volunteer movement has taught us nothing else,
at least it has instructed us in the art of moving about
in fours and columns. The camp at Chobham was
the first rough notion of the coming school of Aldershot.
We were just recovering from <q> the First Exhibition
of '51 Millennium,</q> when it was supposed that
war (except, perhaps, on the stage and in the circus of
Astley's) had become obsolete. Certainly, we had
some slight trouble in various parts of our colonial
possessions, but that was only in connection with <q> the
niggers.</q> And under the generic term of <q> niggers</q>
we included all sorts and conditions of coloured men.
Under this category we classed Indians (West and
natives of Hindostan), New Zealanders, Hottentots,
Zulus, and copper-coloured heroes of Cooper's romances.
That Europeans would quarrel after Sir
Joseph Paxton had built a gigantic conservatory and
<q>the Commissioners of <date value="1851">1851</date></q> had awarded prize
medals to the manufacturers of soaps, pianofortes,
biscuits, and locomotives, seemed to us simply a
ridiculous impossibility. Still, there was no harm to play
at soldiers, and the camp at Chobham was the outcome
of the inclination. The military gathering on
the Surrey downs produced a profound sensation. It
was quite <q> the thing to do </q> to take tea with the
military, and John Leech in the pages of <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> showed

  <p>The camp at Chobham supplied the title for a
play at the Olympic, which I class amongst the earliest
of my <q>Green-room Recollections.</q> The cast included
Robert Keeley and Leigh Murray, and, I
fancy, Miss Charlotte Sanders. But of the lady I am
not at all sure. I rather think I am talking of a
period long before her time-the palmy days of the
Strand Theatre, when Jimmy Rogers and Johnnie
Clark used to share with Patty Oliver, Marie Wilton,
and the actress I have just mentioned, the honours
of the evening. But I distinctly recollect that Leigh
Murray, the elegant light comedian, appeared in the
undress uniform of a cavalry officer and pitched his
tent in Mr. Keeley's front garden. Then Mr. Keeley
himself appeared in a dressing-gown to secure
the decease of an early-crowing fowl. I do not remember
the plot, but I suppose he must have been a guardian
of the walking lady who had attracted the affectionate
regards of the uniformed Leigh Murray. And here
I am reminded that thirty or forty years ago an officer
of the British army never appeared without his
regimentals-on the stage. I have quite forgotten the
name of the walking lady of the period, but fancy she
was called Miss Katherine Rogers. No doubt <hi rend="italics">The

  <p>But pieces at the Olympic of <date value="1853">1853</date> (or thereabouts)
have not much to do with the Autumn Manoeuvres of
the present time. A subject much nearer home is
the way things were done in <date value="1872">1872</date>, just twenty-seven
years ago. I had the honour of taking part in the
first series of Autumn Manoeuvres, which were held
in the neighbourhood of Aldershot. I was a lad in
those distant days, but had the pleasure of being a
subaltern in charge of a company in the Militia. The
battalion to which I belonged was selected for
manoeuvring, and sent from the suburbs of the metropolis to the wilds of Cove Common. We knew
of our destination long before we received the official
information from <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>. An enterprising firm of
outfitters in Aldershot sent us a circular giving us the
prices for camp furniture. This was the herald of
what was to follow. My regiment had not been permanently embodied since the Mutiny, and consequently the battalion had a considerable sum standing
to its credit at the Army Agents'. In spite of an


<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>


increased subscription for the year, we had to dip into
our reserve to the tune, or, perhaps, I should say more
appropriately, regimental march of several hundreds
of pounds. We had, amongst other things, to hire a
mess tent, the one provided by the War Office being
utterly out of proportion with our requirements. From
a financial point of view sending the Militia to the
Autumn Manoeuvres in those days spelt disaster.
And I am not at all sure that the course was entirely
beneficial, even from a military point of view. We
had six weeks on Cove Common before we made a
move, and it was during those forty-two days we were
supposed to get into shape. But this was not an easy
task. When at home in our barrack square we had
our squad, company, and battalion drill, with just
enough musketry to make things interesting. But
at Aldershot we were for ever being called away from
our work to attend brigade drill or to take part in a
march out.  Our general, too, had rather a small
opinion of our (regimental) honesty. He assumed
that nearly every militiaman spent a month with the
colours and the rest of the time in the hands of <q> the
civil power.</q></p></div2>

  <div2 n="THE HONESTY OF THE OLD CONSTITUTIONAL" type="subchapter" id="s114"><head>THE HONESTY OF THE OLD CONSTITUTIONAL
                     FORCE.</head>

  <p>As a matter of fact, this slur upon the
conscientiousness of the regiment, and, I may say the force, was

<pb id="p.167" n="167"/>




entirely undeserved. Our fellows were exceedingly
good fellows, and as honest as the day. It was only
when their devotion to their officers was tested that
their fidelity to their superiors outweighed their
appreciation of the exact value of the words <foreign lang="LA">meum</foreign> and
<foreign lang="LA">tuum</foreign>. For instance, on one occasion, after a weary
march of over twenty miles, we were ordered to pitch
our tents for the night. We had on either side of us
line regiments. As a zealous officer I saw that the
tents of my company were pitched before I looked
after my own. When the time came for the erection
of my modest marquee I found that we had exhausted
our tent pegs-there was not one to be found.</p>
 <p> <q type="spoken">Never mind, Capting,</q> said one of my men; <q type="spoken">you
wait and you will see it will be all right.</q></p>
  <p>And it was. When I returned after mess to my
tent I found it held down with an absolute plethora
of pegs. How they got there I do not know, but as
I heard shrieks in the course of the night from the
lines of the two service battalions (where the tents
were falling like displaced ninepins) I suspect that
after I left them that my men must have gone foraging. But, as I asked no questions subsequently,
I had no opportunity of hearing any statement, true
or otherwise.</p>
  <p>And I am reminded by this experience that things
are not so comfortable nowadays as in the past. A
man was allowed to dig a trench round his tent a

<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>



quarter of a century ago. This permission is now
withdrawn, a bad regulation in rainy weather.</p></div2>



             <div2 n="MISTAKES IN THE PAST" type="subchapter" id="s115"><head>MISTAKES IN THE PAST.</head>

  <p>No doubt some other matters are better managed
than they were in <date value="1872">1872</date>. In that year the great
break-down was the transport. The Government had hired
waggons, and the drivers were civilians, and under
imperfect control. The horses were in many cases
overworked, and could scarcely drag their carts. I
happened to be in charge of the baggage-guard on
one memorable occasion when the troops arrived
hours before their tents. We could not get on. It
was exceedingly hilly country, and the poor horses
could not move. We had to requisition the assistance
of the artillery to get along at all. Some horses from
one of the guns were told off to help us, and served
as leaders to the hired wheelers in the shafts.  The
next morning, after we had pitched our tents anyhow
and anywhere, the encampment was a sight to see!
The only <q> dressing </q> to be had came from the Duke
of Cambridge, then the officer Commanding in Chief
the British Army. Men had to find their way to
their lines as best they could. A song might have
been appropriately composed for the occasion, and
called <q>When you want to know your camp ask

<pb id="p.169" n="169"/>






a sentry.</q>  As one of the officers in command
of the baggage-guard, I was called upon to
furnish a report.  I did; letting the Government
have it right and left. I have a sort of notion that
this document (which would have made an excellent
leading article) stood in the way of my promotion.
I do not wish to suggest anything in the least offensive to the authorities in <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>, but I cannot help
calling attention to the fact that to this day I am <hi rend="italics">not</hi>
a General of Militia.</p>
</div2>

<div2 n="QUITE A LITTLE HOLIDAY FOR OFFICERS AND MEN" type="subchapter" id="s116"><head>QUITE A LITTLE HOLIDAY FOR OFFICERS AND MEN.</head>

  <p>Recently the Regulars have had the manceuvres to
themselves.  Of course, everything was carefully
thought out. They fought their fight with the minimum of chance, and, victorious or defeated, the rival
armies knew where to encamp for the night and where
to get water. There were no difficulties about supplies, and the commissariat was perfect.  During
one set of manoeuvres the Prince of Wales, who was
out with his cavalry regiment, was taken prisoner by
some enterprising privates belonging to the old Constitutional Force.  One-and-twenty years ago the
Commander of the Blues, considering the day of hostilities to commence immediately after midnight,
dashed off in that early moment of the morning and
nearly terminated the campaign by taking everyone

<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>



prisoner. However, I believe he was sent back with
a flea in his ear, and informed that he was <q> slightly
premature.</q> Warfare was not expected to commence
before 8 a.m.! Again, the damage to the crops has
been less, and the transport, of course, has been all
that can be desired. Even the dipping of the colours
is easier and more effective. Of late years the regimental flags have decreased in size, and it is possible
to be graceful in dipping them to Royalty, even when
the hired charger of the senior Major is restive and
inclined to take post in the front rank of A company.
No doubt the Autumn Manoeuvres and the Short
Service system have had much to do with the creation
of that admirable army which has recently gained
such distinction in Africa-North and South.

<p>EASTER Sunday and Monday for the last twenty
years or so have been invariably associated with the
Volunteers. Not so very long ago the Review was
one of the features of the military year. But of late
it has become the fashion to <q> cry down</q> the credit
of the force, and to assume that the two hundred
thousand men forming the Citizen Army of England
are merely a weapon-carrying mob. I fancy that
this has been the fault to a great extent of the
Volunteers themselves. They have been so ready to
take for granted that <soCalled>professional</soCalled> opinion must be
right that they have ignored their own common-sense.
I have often been amused at seeing a Colonel of
Volunteers of twenty years' service-a man who has
passed the school at the Wellington Barracks and
has earned the <q>T</q> for tactics-absolutely hanging
on the words of some subaltern of scarcely six

<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>



months' standing. And when I say amused, I might
almost add ashamed. The Colonel of Volunteers is
impressed with the <q>regular.</q>  But of late the
<q>snubbing</q> to which I have referred, if not on the
decrease, is being mitigated by what may be termed
<q> honourable compensation.</q> Some little while ago
officers of twenty years' service received a decoration,
then it was extended to sergeants, now it is to be
given to corporals, lance-corporals, and the rank and
file. The snubbing is the brimstone and the decoration is the treacle. But, unfortunately, the brimstone
dealt out to our Volunteers is scarcely likely to be
more useful to our riflemen than the same nauseous
medicine was to the scholars of Dotheboys Hall.
However, as Volunteers and their work are at the
moment well to the fore, thanks to the absence of
the regulars on active service, it may not be out of
place to devote a few pages to the consideration of
the merits of these martial Londoners as we find
them at the end of the century.</p></div2>


    <div2 n="THE DAYS OF THE FIRST VOLUNTEERS" type="subchapter" id="s118"><head>THE DAYS OF THE FIRST VOLUNTEERS.</head>

  <p>Of course all the world knows (and by the phrase
I refer chiefly to the <foreign lang="LA">habitues</foreign> of the Reading-Room
at the British Museum) that in the early years of
<date value="1800">1800</date> the Volunteers were immensely useful in
dispelling the scare raised by the rumour that we

<pb id="p.173" n="173"/>



were about to be invaded by the French. In spite
of the paucity in our numbers as compared with our
population of to-day, we managed to gather together
a host of men. The force in London alone compared
favourably with our existing Metropolitan Volunteer
Corps. A short while ago I had occasion to glance
through an old Army List published before the
century departed had reached its teens, and was
surprised to find that all the <q> Loyal Volunteers</q> had
their full complement of officers. There was no
difficulty in getting men to accept commissions eighty or
ninety years ago, and many a portrait of a
grand-father or great-grandfather in full regimentals,
honoured by members of the present generation,
affords evidence that the recipients of the King's
favours were not ashamed of their uniforms. Gentlemen
of various professions joined the ranks and
worked their way up to the silver epaulettes. They
did not seem to consider that they were doing more
than their duty, and it is interesting to note that
although the militia sometimes came in for the hard
rubs of the caricaturists, the volunteers were allowed
to go Scot free. It was assumed, and I think rightly
assumed, that if a man took the trouble to find time
from his general legitimate work to make himself
efficient for the defence of his native land he deserved
well of his country. The scare died away, and with
it the <q>Loyal Volunteers.</q> The corps disappeared

<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>




from the army lists, and the old colours found a
resting-place in the churches. Not very long ago I
came across a number of flags in St. Luke's (the old
St. Luke's), Chelsea, close to Battersea Bridge. They
had been there for more than half a century, and,
hearing that the <persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName>'s Westminsters might possibly
be able to lay claim to their reversion, I called the
attention of Colonel Sir Howard Vincent to their
existence. If they are still at St. Luke's, or have
been removed, I know not, but I have no doubt that
a diligent search would assist in the discovery of a
number of other colours that have fluttered in the
breezes of Hyde Park in the days of the Georges.</p></div2>

                     SCARE.</head>

  <p>Later on there was another attempted revival.
The Prince de Joinville in the time of Louis Philippe,
King of the French, threatened <q>the perfidious
Albion</q> with a hostile visit. It was at a time when
<q>Dicky</q> Doyle was delighting the readers of <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>
with those charming pictures of the manners and
customs of the English, to which poor <q> Professor </q>
Percival Leigh in his <q> Mr. Pipp's Diary,</q> furnished
the letterpress. Mr. Doyle showed in a panorama
how the French army would leave France to suffer
the tortures of <foreign lang="FR">mal de mer</foreign> in the Channel, how <q> the

<pb id="p.175" n="175"/>



Iron Duke</q> would watch their movements through
a telescope from a Martello tower, how, on their
arrival in London <q>Monsieur Jullien</q> would be
arrested, how 85, <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, would be besieged,
and how the entire French army would have to
retreat, hotly pursued by <hi rend="italics">Mr. Punch</hi> and his dog
Toby. That was the tone that was taken about a
French invasion some fifty years ago, and on the
whole it was not an entirely satisfactory tone. Its
result was much good-natured chaff when the
Volunteer movement again appeared. About <date value="1850">1850</date>
rifle corps were proposed, and John Leech and his
<foreign lang="FR">collaborateur</foreign>, the author of the <q> Comic History of
England,</q> laughed <q> the movement</q> out of court by
their admirable series of <q> The Brook Green
Volunteer.</q> We were not prepared to take things
too seriously in those days, and were inclined to
believe that the Regulars in their white ducks on the
First of May were quite sufficient to meet all military
requirements.</p></div2>


            <div2 n="THE REVIVAL OF 1860" type="subchapter" id="s120"><head>THE REVIVAL OF <date value="1860">1860</date>.</head>

  <p>It may be possible that the merry treatment that
the solitary defender of Brook Green received at the
pen and pencil of his biographers made people
a little nervous about a revival. I think that Captain
Hans Busk was the first to suggest the establishment

<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>



of Rifle clubs. He did not venture at first
to carry his idea any further. There were to be
rifle clubs where men should fire at targets representing
enemies instead of potting clay balls in lieu
of pigeons. The clubs were a great success, and very
shortly after their inauguration the brilliant notion
occurred to someone to convert them into regiments.
From that moment to this the Volunteers have
flourished.  They have had their ups and downs.
They have been chaffed, but they have lived it down.
<hi rend="italics">In Pictures from <q>Punch</q></hi> there are several specimens
of the humour that found its subject in the
doings of the Volunteers. The reason that a more
encouraging tone was adopted later on is possibly
attributable to the fact that Charles Keene was a
private in the Artists' corps and Tom Taylor
a captain in the Civil Service Rifles.  Be this
as it may, there is no doubt that Mr. <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> ever
since <date value="1860">1860</date> has done his level best to support the
Volunteers, and with excellent results. <q> The Sage of
<placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName></q> usually sets the fashion, and certainly
in this case the mode has been followed by all his
more serious contemporaries.  John Leech often
sketched the riflemen after their revival, but the
Brook Green Private was never reproduced. And
<foreign lang="FR">a propos</foreign> of this series, I may note that Gilbert Abbott
&#x0026; Beckett, the author of the <q>Comic History of
England,</q> was himself the son of an officer of

<pb id="p.177" n="177"/>






Volunteers.  His father was a captain in the St.
James's Corps in <date value="1810">1810</date>.</p></div2>


         <div2 n="THE BAPTISM OF HARD WORK" type="subchapter" id="s121"><head>THE BAPTISM OF HARD WORK.</head>

  <p>And now we come to the present time. As luck
will have it I have had an opportunity of seeing
something of volunteering, first in England and next
in France. In the days when an officer of the Militia
could also hold a commission in <q>another place,</q> I
commanded a small corps. I can speak with confidence of the sincere efforts that my gunners made
to become worthy of the title of soldiers. Both commanders and commanded took an infinity of pains
to learn their duties.  Men become Volunteers
because they are born soldiers. No man joins the
ranks, either commissioned or non-commissioned,
unless he really loves the profession of arms. Very
often the Service <q>Tommy Atkins</q> joins in a
moment of pique, and frequently regrets his action
within a month of its occurrence.  He has been
crossed in love if he is a clodhopper; he wants to
spite his relatives if he is a "gentleman born." In
the latter case he begs his father to buy him off when
he finds his barrack life rougher than he anticipated.
The best thing his father can do is to sternly refuse
to assist him for at least a year. After he has had
twelve months of <q>stables,</q> or <q>fatigue duty,</q> he

<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>



will be cured of the <q> scarlet fever.</q> If his discharge
is purchased within the statutory time for a reduction,
on the next occasion he will enlist again. If the
lad has really something in him, it is not impossible
that he may work his way up from the rank and
file into the sergeants' mess, and ultimately into the
officers' ante-room. If he has not, why, then let the
boy have a good <q>bucketing.</q> A year's work in a
regiment will do him a world of good and not an inch
of harm.</p></div2>


       <div2 n="VOLUNTEERS IN NAME AND DEED" type="subchapter" id="s122"><head>VOLUNTEERS IN NAME AND DEED.</head>

  <p>However, it is not the <soCalled>hard bargains</soCalled> of the
service who join the volunteers, but men who would
make their way anywhere. Many give for love what
is in the other class extorted by fear. And here I
am reminded of a conversation I once had with a
young German during the war of <dateRange from="1870" to="1871">1870-71</dateRange>. We were
in a railway carriage travelling between Cologne and
Coblentz, and my companion was full of abuse of
everything British. We had no army, no fleet, "no
nothing." He abused our soldiers as slaves.</p>
  <p>"Come," said I at last, "they are not quite that.
They are all volunteers."</p>
  <p>When I had more fully explained he was absolutely
astounded. Did I really mean that every soldier in
the British forces was a warrior by his own choice?

<pb id="p.179" n="179"/>






I acquiesced. Then he was silent for quite a quarter
of an hour.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">I beg your pardon,</q> said he at last, in a subdued
tone, <q type="spoken">but can you tell me how a German can become
naturalised ?</q></p>
  <p>As for the fighting qualities of the Volunteers I
can say that the hastily raised troops of the French
during the great war acquitted themselves as well,
and better, than the regular army.  Again, the
Americans on both sides-Federal and Confederate
-fought gallantly, although two-thirds of them were
the rawest of raw recruits. Lord Wolseley has said
somewhere that the discipline of an ordinary militia
regiment is quite good enough to serve as a model for
the entire service when an army is in the field. The
marching of the Guards is a thing of beauty and a
joy for ever, but something more is required before
the enemy. That something more is obtained in a
very short space of time. Only recently we have
heard of the admirable conduct of Volunteers in
Africa. It does not require much <q>polishing</q> to
make a citizen soldier into a first-rate " fighting-man."</p>
</div2>

        <div2 n="AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS" type="subchapter" id="s123"><head>AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS.</head>

  <p>But to leave generalities to come to particulars.
On two distinct occasions the Rifles have shown
themselves to be excellent troops. A few years ago




<pb id="p.180" n="180"/>



the Canadian Volunteers gave a good account of the
Fenians, and a little later the Post Office Volunteers
sent an admirably disciplined force to Egypt. And
more recently our Colonial Volunteers have worked
wonders in our Cape possessions.</p>
  <p>The German system has shown us how a man
who has had a <foreign lang="FR">soupcon</foreign> of military training as a lad
can be recalled to the colours in middle age and
become a first-class warrior. The moment hostilities
broke out between Prussia and France, hundreds of
quiet sober young clerks threw up their situations in
London and hurried away to the Fatherland. They
proved themselves thoroughly capable as cavalry,
infantry, and artillery, and I venture to think that if
the volunteers were called to the colours in defence
of their native land they would be equally reliable.
Under these circumstances it seems a folly, a shame,
a crime, to <q>snub </q> our citizen soldiers. Nothing kills
so surely as ridicule. The comic papers are more
merciful than the officials of the War Office.  If
there is a field day regulars are given the principal
commands, and the Volunteers' <q> C.O.s </q> are left in
the cold. This is one of the many grievances that
should meet with redress. In spite of C.B.'s (Civil)
and long service medals the citizens are distinctly
snubbed. Of course an invasion would set everything
to rights, but that is a blessing that we would
not desire. Until the days of disaster arrive, then, the

<pb id="p.181" n="181"/>





Volunteers must be accepted on trust. They are
certainly a very fine body of men. And here before
I conclude these brief remarks I may refer to the
proposed Ladies' Ambulance Corps. The members
of this novel gathering are not only to act as nurses
in the hospital but soldiers in the field. They are
emphatically to hold their own. I cannot help thinking
that the idea is a mistake. When I was in France
and Germany during the war I saw a good deal of
the <q>Sisters.</q> Of course, amongst them were some
conscientious, self-sacrificing persons. But there were
exceptions (possibly proving the rule) in the shape
of a few fussy and tiresome females. These ladies
were anything rather than popular with the doctors,
and, I must add, anything rather than popular with
the patients. It appears to me that Amazons may
be all very well at a music-hall, but will be decidedly
out of place at the seat of war.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, may the London Volunteers increase
and prosper. Let not the citizen soldier be ridden
rough-shod by the regular. After all, they are both
Englishmen, and the amateur is frequently the equal
of the professional.  This is true enough with
cricket; then why not with soldiering?</p></div2>

<p>IN the spring of the year the newspapers are full of
accounts of the trainings of the battalions of Militia.
As a rule the press notices are extremely brief. The
public are told that so many regiments have been
called up for the customary twenty-seven days of
service with the colours, and so many having performed their allotted duty, have been dismissed to
their hearths and homes. Some of the professional
organs of the Constitutional Force give a few details,
such as <q>the 4th Royal Blankshire have had their
annual inspection,</q> and the <q> 12th Rifle Brigade
(<persName key="Albert">Prince Consort</persName>'s Own) have been sent to Aldershot,</q>
but as a rule, even the avowedly military journals are
a trifle reticent of the doings of <q> the first line of the
reserve.</q> But it is a notable fact that the end of the
century finds half the Constitutional Force embodied.</p></div2>

            <div2 n="OBTAINING A COMMISSION" type="subchapter" id="s125"><head>OBTAINING A COMMISSION.</head>
  <p>It is not a difficult matter to get a commission in
the Militia. A lad must know a commanding officer,

<pb id="p.183" n="183"/>





must have a clean bill of health from the authorities
of his school, and be generally a good fellow, and a
sub-lieutenancy follows on application as a matter of
course. I myself have had the honour of serving in
two regiments-one a metropolitan corps, and the
other with its headquarters in the country. My
brother officers in both battalions belonged to the
same class of men. In the town regiment many of
the captains had been in the service, and our colonel
had also, as a lieutenant, worn the gold lace prior to
its adoption by the Militia. In the county battalion
most of our men (like the rank and file) were country
born. During the twenty-seven days of our training
they were intensely military, and quite as smart as
the majority of their brothers in the service battalions.
I noticed that what may be termed the civilian
officers (to distinguish them from their ex-service
colleagues), were, as a whole, more zealous than their
ex-professional brethren. When I first obtained my
company, after some ten years' faithful service as a
subaltern, a great influx of the recently-retired were
drafted into the commissioned ranks. At first the
newcomers took much interest in the proceedings
of the men on parade, but when they found that
Militiamen were a little slow in <q> forming fours</q> or
<q> advancing in column,</q> they seemed to lose heart in
their work, and became as slovenly as the men they
had been sent to command. The native Militia

<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>



officers, so far from deteriorating as the training became older, on the contrary, gradually improved.
They rubbed off their rust in the first week, and by
the fourth were as bright and as sharp as
newly-burnished needles. The civilians began at their
worst and ended at their best, whilst the ex-warriors
reversed the operation. Under these circumstances,
were I a commanding officer of a Militia regiment
(which I frankly admit I am not), I would prefer
civilians to ex-soldiers. Possibly the fact that I was
a civilian officer myself has made me take a prejudiced view of the subject. But I will not go beyond
<q> perhaps.</q></p></div2>

  <p>It has often been my lot to be asked by some
youngster thirsting for as much military glory as can
be obtained at Aldershot or some other spot within
the British Islands, <q>which should he choose, town
or country? </q> My answer has depended on circumstances.
If the boy has belonged to a county family
I have suggested that he should become a son of the
soil. There is no bond of union between neighbours
so pleasant as the regimental tie of the local
Yeomanry or the Militia. But if the budding Wellington
hails from Cockayne let him join one of the
London regiments. There are several particularly
smart battalions, the Royal Fusiliers, the East Surrey,

<pb id="p.185" n="185"/>





but for choice, I take the 5th and 7th Rifle Brigade.
The last has been immortalised by the late Charles
Keene in the pages of <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>. The best of our
draughtsmen drew a diminutive Militiaman accosting
an adjutant. Said the officer to the private: <q type="spoken">And
who may you be?</q> Returned the private to the
officer: <q type="spoken">Please, sir, I'm the 7th Battalion of the
Rifle Brigade, Prince Consort's Own, better known
as the Tower 'Amlets Milishy!</q> And very fine
fellows the <q> Tower 'Amlets Milishy</q> are, were (and
if I may presume on a prophecy), ever will be. And
as one regiment is as good as another perhaps, I, in
referring to the Militia, may confine my remarks to
this distinguished regiment, as I had the honour for
many years of serving in its commissioned ranks.</p>
</div2>

      <div2 n="A TRUE STORY OF THE MILISHY" type="subchapter" id="s127"><head>A TRUE STORY OF <q>THE MILISHY.</q></head>

  <p>When I joined, the first story that was told me at
mess was a legend connected with the embodiment
of the regiment during the Indian Mutiny. It was in
a splendid state of efficiency when a second battalion
was added to the 24th, and a number of raw recruits
were sent to Aldershot to occupy the lines close to
where the King's Own Light Infantry (as the Tower
Hamlets were called forty years ago) were stationed.
On a Christmas Day a quarrel arose between the
King's Own and the 24th as to the respective merits

<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>



of the dinners supplied to each regiment. The 24th
ran to their quarters, seized their guns and ammunition and blazed away on their brethren in the Militia.</p>
<p>The King's Own stood the fire unflinchingly, but did
not retaliate. The Second 24th were marched out
of camp, and the Duke subsequently informed them
that had he his way he would send them to a spot
not recognised by the <persName key="Victoria">Queen</persName>'s regulations. <q type="spoken">But,</q> said H.R.H. <q type="spoken">as I cannot send you there you shall
go to the next best place, the Mauritius.</q> And off
went the Second 24th, and remained away from
England many years. Since then the 24th have
never met the K.O.L.I.M., but the old feud is kept
up, or was until very recently. It would be still, I
fancy, a dangerous matter to put the two battalions
in adjoining lines. I will undertake to say that the
Militia have not forgotten the old quarrel, and I will
be bound that the incident, nearly half a century old,
is still fresh in the memory of the Second 24th.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="A FALSE STORY OF THE MILISHY" type="subchapter" id="s128"><head>A FALSE STORY OF <q>THE MILISHY.</q></head>

  <p>And   having  told  a true  story  about the
K.O.L.I.M. I may relate one that I know to be
false. As a matter of fact there was never a
steadier body of men than the rank and file of
that renowned corps. While I had the honour of
being an officer on full pay (for twenty-seven days a

<pb id="p.187" n="187"/>




year) we received votes of thanks from the aristocracy, gentry, and inhabitants of Hackney for our
lamb-like conduct whilst protecting Dalston from
<q>the hoofs of the ruthless invader.</q> Still, in spite
of this testimonial to our respectability, we had a
reputation (amongst the ignorant and malicious) of
being occasionally doubtful about the exact value of
the words <foreign lang="LA">meum</foreign> and <foreign lang="LA">tuum</foreign>.</p>
  <p>Possibly it was because we suffered from this unjust stigma that a detective once presented himself
when the regiment was on parade and asked permission to examine the ranks with a view to discovering a gentleman belonging to <q>ours </q> who was
wanted by <q>the civil power.</q> Permission being
given to the detective, that worthy representative of
Scotland Yard, accompanied by the adjutant of the
regiment, made the tour of the various companies,
front rank and rear rank. When the official had got
to the last man of the rear rank of the rear company,
he stopped suddenly and gazed earnestly at the
rather embarrassed warrior who by position was on
the left of the column.</p>
  <p><q>Why, you surely have made a mistake!</q> exclaimed the adjutant indignantly. <q>Why, you have
pitched on the best man in the battalion. He has
been with us for more than twenty years and he is
our pattern soldier. His arms are a mass of good
conduct badges, and he is the example of all that is

<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>


best in the life of a soldier. You surely do not know
him ? </q></p>
  <p><q> No,</q> replied the detective, <q> I do not-<hi rend="italics">but I know
all the others!</hi> </q></p>
  <p>This story in military circles will be regarded as a
<soCalled>chestnut.</soCalled> And I must admit that it has not even
the <q> additional advantage </q> of being true.</p></div2>


        <div2 n="TOMMY ATKINS IN RESERVE" type="subchapter" id="s129"><head><q>TOMMY ATKINS</q> IN RESERVE.</head>

  <p>It has been of late the fashion to cry up <q> Tommy
Atkins,</q> and I must confess that my knowledge of
the gentleman, as represented in the old Constitutional
Force, is distinctly in his favour. Take them
all in all our soldiers are an excellent set of fellows.
Treated well they will go anywhere and do anything.
During one of the trainings we were
stationed at Aldershot, and for our sins were sent on
a flying column. Sometimes we had to march thirty
miles a day and not one of our lads (off duty they
were costers) would knock off and seek shelter in the
ambulance cart. One man in my own company was
sent by the doctor to the rear because he had a sore
foot, but when we came into camp there was the
wounded gentleman tramping by the side of the
ambulance cart, and pretending to be guarding it.
He had stoutly refused to enter it.</p>
  <p><q>Leave that sort of game,</q> said my gentleman,

<pb id="p.189" n="189"/>





<q>to those beggars,</q> and he pointed with scorn to a
cart-load of Guardsmen who had broken down under
the stress of the intense heat and the heavy marching.</p>
  <p><q> They may have their faults, sir,</q> said my sergeant
to me, <q>far be it from me to deny it, but they are
good plucked ones! </q></p>
  <p>And so they were.</p></div2>


                  <div2 n="SUMMING UP" type="subchapter" id="s130"><head>SUMMING UP.</head>

  <p>Did space permit I could (to the great distress of
my readers) write pages about my pet Metropolitan Militiamen. But I must desist and be practical.
I would strongly advise every parent with a lad who
can spare a month a year, to let him take it out in
the old Constitutional Force. It need not be very
expensive. The uniform, carefully chosen, should
not cost more than a fifty pound note, and the pay
and allowances should go a long way towards liquidating the cost of the training. Of course, on
joining the newcomer will have to pay an entrance
fee in the shape of a contribution to the Regimental
Fund, and every year there are payments regulated
by his rank. But if he does not take much wine at
mess, and has the nerve to avoid useless extravagance, he should pull through without materially
lessening his parents' banking account. Of course
there are regiments and regiments. If the battalion

<pb id="p.190" n="190"/>


is entertained, and entertain, all the officers, without
exception, must bear the cost. But a quiet London
battalion-especially if sent to Aldershot-should
be within the means of almost anyone. All that a
lad requires is good health and good temper. If he
has these requisites, I will warrant that he will find a
training in the Militia-with its wholesome discipline and its tone of service chivalry-the most
delightful of experiences.</p>
  <p>At least I know that when I was in the service I
did.</p>

     <div2 n="LONDON GUNNERS AT SHOEBURYNESS." type="subchapter" id="s131"><head> LONDON GUNNERS AT SHOEBURYNESS.</head>

<p>ONCE a year the artillery Volunteers hold their
annual meeting at Shoeburyness. The newspapers
at the time have entered the <q> silly season,</q> and find
room to record the doings of the gunners, and it is
instructive to note how much less space is devoted to
Shoeburyness than is reserved for Bisley. And yet
of the two meetings I should say (and I believe that
most professional soldiers would agree with me) that
the competition on the Essex coast is the more important.
But there is no doubt about it, the infantry arm
of the Volunteer service is <hi rend="italics">the</hi> popular branch. Not
only with civilians, but with our citizen soldiers
themselves. This is easily proved by statistics. I have
not the figures at hand, but I believe that out of the
whole number of our enrolled volunteers only about
a fifth are gunners. This is not surprising, as the

<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>



infantry have more chances of showing themselves in
public than their <q>scientific</q> comrades. The policy
of the authorities is nowadays to keep the artillery
to their field-pieces or guns of position. Thus
marching out and battalion drill, the delight of the <q>foot
soldiers,</q> are discountenanced in favour of service at
the batteries and work at <q> repository.</q></p></div2>


  <div2 n="THE LATE LORD TENNYSON AS A VOLUNTEER ARTILLERYMAN" type="subchapter" id="s132"><head>THE LATE LORD TENNYSON AS A VOLUNTEER
                 ARTILLERYMAN.</head>

  <p>I fancy that if we distinguish amongst the Volunteers we shall find that the gunners are more earnest
than their less gifted comrades. I possibly have a
slight bias in favour of the gunners, as many years
ago I had the honour to command a regiment of
Volunteer artillery. It was in the early days of the
movement, when batteries, battalions and brigades
were small but not particularly compact. My corps
consisted of a couple of batteries, with a permission
from the War Office to raise a third battery.  The
regiment had been founded by a gentleman who was
connected with literature, and when I took over the
command I had amongst my men no less a person
than the late Lord <persName key="Tennyson,Alfred">Tennyson</persName>. The Poet Laureate
never appeared on parade, but he showed his good
will to the corps by writing some stirring lines, that
were set to music, in praise of the guns. These

<pb id="p.193" n="193"/>




verses were never publicly acknowledged, and were
signed <q>T .,</q> but, for all that, they were known to
have emanated from the pen that had given to the
world <q> The Idylls of the King.</q> I was sorry that
I was never able to receive the salute of Gunner
<persName key="Tennyson,Alfred">Tennyson</persName>, for I am sure he would have looked remarkably
well in our uniform. Leaving the H.A.C.
out of the question, we were the only regiment of
Horse Artillery. As a matter of fact, I do not think
we ever appeared in full rig. Although harness was
served out to us by the War Office, and we had the
right to wear plumes or <q>shaving brushes</q> in our
busbies, we never horsed our guns. When I had the
honour of taking over the command we were acting
as infantry, or perhaps I may say garrison artillery.
One of my batteries rejoiced in the possession of a
<q>dummy gun,</q> and that was the extent of our ordnance.
However, for all that and all that, <q>Alfred
<persName key="Tennyson,Alfred">Tennyson</persName>, Esq., Poet Laureate</q> was on the strength
of the regiment, and although he was not exactly
<q>efficient,</q> we were very proud of him.</p></div2>


       <div2 n="GOING TO SCHOOL AT WOOLWICH" type="subchapter" id="s133"> <head>GOING TO SCHOOL AT WOOLWICH.</head>

  <p>When I was in command I duly qualified myself
for duties by passing <q> the School at Woolwich.</q> At
the time I was at <q> the headquarters of Ubique,</q> the
Duke of Connaught, then a captain in the Rifle Brigade,

<pb id="p.194" n="194"/>


was learning gun drill with a neighbouring detachment. Some new breech-loaders had been recently introduced into the service, and consequently
H.R.H., although he had served as a subaltern in the
scientific branch, had been sent to school to learn all
about them. In those days, to get a certificate an
officer was required to know the drill of every gun
in the force, besides the ordinary <q>red book </q> literature. I believe of late this regulation has been relaxed, and an auxiliary gunner is only asked to get
up the drill of the gun with which his own corps is
furnished. The course in my days took rather over
a month. The members of the class wore <q> jumpers</q>
and worked like niggers. Repository drill was particularly trying. The practice of <q> parbuckling</q> and
raising guns with the assistance of a gin are terribly
fatiguing. After many years, I look back with pride
to the days when I was capable of such physical exertion. Really and truly, my work was as hard as
that of a mender of roads or a bricklayer. Thinking
over the matter, it seems to me that the course was
conducted on the Squeers principle. It will be remembered that that eminent pedagogue used to teach his
pupils how to spell <q> winders </q> and then set them to
clean them.</p>
  <p><q>What is parbuckling?</q> asked the schoolmaster
at Woolwich.</p>
  <p><q>A method by which guns can be dismounted from

<pb id="p.195" n="195"/>




one carriage and placed on another,</q> replied the
scholar, with more or less accuracy.</p>
 <p> <q>Quite so,</q> replied Teacher War Office, <q>and now
go and parbuckle.</q></p>
  <p>And the scholar obeyed his instructions.</p>
  <p>When I was at Woolwich the General in command
used now and again to attend our class and put us
on to some problem or other. On one occasion I was
singled out for this distinction.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Captain &#x0026; Beckett,</q> said my C.O., <q type="spoken">will you be so
good as to tell me what you would do under the
following circumstances? You have a gun yoked to
oxen. You are passing a gate, and the wheels of
the carriage are stopped by the posts. What, sir,
would you do under those circumstances?</q></p>
  <p><q>Remove the posts, sir.</q>
  <q> Can't, sir-the posts are immovable.</q>
  <q>Well, take the wheel off the gun, sir.</q>
  <q> Can't, sir; you can't get at it.</q>
  <q> Take off the gun itself, sir.</q>
  <q>Won't do, sir; the gun is as inaccessible as the
wheel.</q>
  <q>Well, sir, back the oxen until the gun is clear.</q>
  <q> Can't, sir; oxen won't back.</q>
  <q>Then what ought I to do, sir ?</q>
  <q>Can't say, sir. I am here to ask questions and
not to answer them! </q></p>
  <p>So my curiosity was never satisfied. If to-morrow

<pb id="p.196" n="196"/>



I found myself in the suggested dilemma I should
not know how to act beyond resigning on the spot
and going home to tea! Possibly one of my military
readers can solve the problem for himself.  The
commandant of the school to which I referred was
unequal to the task.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="A RECOLLECTION OF SHOEBURYNESS" type="subchapter" id="s134"><head>A RECOLLECTION OF SHOEBURYNESS.</head>

  <p>To return to Shoeburyness. There is no doubt
that the discipline and work at the meeting are both
admirable. In the days of Wimbledon, when the
Volunteers certainly took matters calmly, the contrast
between Surrey and Essex was most remarkable.
But even now, when the National Rifle Association
has changed its quarters, there is no comparison between the gunners and the sharpshooters. At Shoeburyness there is a discipline in the air. There is not
much to choose between the silver lace and the gold,
the white and the yellow. Years ago I took part in
a meeting of the N.A.A., and was delighted with the
outing. As I was not entered for any competition
I was used merely as a regimental officer, and invited
to make myself generally useful. On one occasion
I was in command of a range party, whose duty it
was to ascertain and signal the various shots as they
hit or missed the target. We were put on our stage
(in mid ocean) at seven in the morning and kept there

<pb id="p.197" n="197"/>





until late at night.  It was delightfully fresh and
appetite-increasing. At mid-day the guns at the batteries ceased firing, and everyone went to lunch.
When I write <q>everyone,</q> I mean all those on shore.
We poor people at the ranges were entirely forgotten.
However, when the batteries after the interval desired a record of their firing, I refused to gratify their
wishes until our creature comforts had received adequate attention. I accordingly signalled <q>lunch</q> to all applications to know <q>What's the matter?</q> until
the necessary meal had been supplied. Subsequently,
being required to give my <q>reasons in writing</q> for
my conduct, I wrote a <q>leading article</q> sort of a
report, in which I set forth that as I had not been
supplied with food, the men under my command, exposed to the exhausting rays of the sun, would have
probably become victims to <q>stroke</q> and possibly
to <q>collapse</q>-hence my demand for lunch. I was
subsequently officially informed that my explanation
was <q>satisfactory.</q></p></div2>


           <div2 n="GUNS TO THE FRONT" type="subchapter" id="s135"><head> <q>GUNS TO THE FRONT.</q></head>

  <p>There can be no doubt that in case of <q>national
emergency </q> the Volunteer artillery would be immediately useful. Their discipline is extremely good,
and they at once would become of considerable value
behind earthworks. As garrison gunners I think most

<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>



experts would admit they would be able to take post
with regulars. They, of course, could serve the guns
every bit as well as their professional comrades. The
War Office has done its best to discourage field batteries, and I think to some extent, not unwisely.
Behind earthworks the Volunteer gunners, as I have
said, would be equal to any troops similarly situated
in the wide world. But in the open the matter might
be different. It is in this that the value of discipline
(acquired morning, noon and night) becomes fully
apparent. To be able to face a rain of bullets unmoved, when the enemy is out of sight and smokeless
powder is the order of the day, is a feat that cannot
be acquired in a <q>brace of shakes,</q> nor yet in five
minutes. No doubt the Volunteers would show pluck
when the time came, but they would show it with less
inconvenience were they to acquire the knack with
the aid of adequate discipline. Behind earthworks the
serving of guns is purely mechanical, so it will be seen
at a glance how immensely valuable our Volunteer
artillerymen will be when they are told off to relieve
the regulars at our coast defences. All they will have
to do will be to fire straight.  And that art they
acquire, thanks to the organisation of the National
Artillery Association. So it is our duty as well as our
inclination to wish that hard-working and useful body
every success.</p>
  <p>And we do. But as Lord Roberts has suggested,

<pb id="p.199" n="199"/>




wishes are less valuable than money. And this saying should be laid to heart by those patrons of Bisley,
who, after giving any number of prizes to our riflemen, find they have nothing left for our Volunteer
artillerymen.</p>

<p>WHEN the season commences and <q> lists of engagements</q>
begin to be filled up weeks, and even
months ahead, the annual question must be faced and
answered. Who is to be lion-in-chief ? <q> Celebrities </q>
are certainly flourishing at the end of the century.
We have our varieties. Now it is a soldier, now
an explorer, now a <q>nigger,</q> now an author, now a
<q>fiddler.</q></p>
  <p>I fancy that lions of a season can be justly divided
into two varieties-those who deserve attention on
account of their merits and those who claim it on
account of their eccentricities. Many years ago a
friend of mine was a great collector of human
curiosities. <q>All London </q> used to be present at his
receptions. It was capital fun  to   see  <q>the
menagerie,</q> and the refreshments were by Gunter,
or some other eminent artist of the kitchen. One
afternoon he met me in great glee.</p>



<pb id="p.201" n="201"/>



 <p> <q>You see by your card,</q> said he, <q> that I have
secured the attendance of the Chinese Ambassador ?</q></p>
  <p>I admitted that I was burning with curiosity to see
the representative of the Father of the Sun, or the
Uncle of the Moon, or whatever other title the ruler
of China assumes when <foreign lang="FR">chez lui</foreign>.</p>
  <p><q> Yes, I knew you would like to see him,</q> assented
my host, <q>but I have done better than get him. He
is here with his national costume complete, and that's
an attraction in itself-isn't it? But what do you
think? I have induced His Excellency to bring his
music with him, and he is just going to sing a comic
song!</q></p>
  <p>And my friend was right. The Ambassador gave
us a very charming and amusing song. It was full
of humour. Of course I should have appreciated it
better had I understood the language. But we all
laughed heartily, as if nothing pleased us so well as
a really witty saying in pure Pekinian. Later on an
accomplished friend of mine obliged with one of his
inimitable <q>piano entertainments.</q>  The performance
in every way was excellent, and we were all
immensely pleased with it, but I am afraid that many
of us had a sneaking preference for the Ambassador's
<foreign lang="FR">chinoiserie</foreign>. The latter was so quaint, and (so far as
we were able to judge without understanding the
lingo) so thoroughly and entirely original.</p>



<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>



  <p>On another occasion the same host was delighted
at having secured a new kind of explorer.</p>
  <p><q> He is not one of those fellows who fill up maps
for the publishers and get gold medals from the
Royal Geographical Society,</q> my friend explained,
<q>but really a first-class hero.</q></p>
  <p><q>What has he done?</q></p>
  <p><q>Why, he had the courage-the almost incredible
courage-to wish the King of the Cobra Isles good
morning! </q></p>
 <p><q>Really. And did the King return the compliment?</q></p>
 <p><q>Return the compliment! Why, it is death to
speak to the King! If a man looks at His Majesty
his eyes are put out with red-hot irons, and if he
touches him he is cast forthwith into the cave of
serpents, and dies in terrible agonies.</q></p>
 <p> <q> Well, how did our sunburnt friend escape? </q></p>
  <p><q> Why, fortunately, the King of the Cobra Isles was
a little deaf, and didn't hear him. However, the
<hi rend="italic">Adacanvassa</hi>-a native official corresponding, I
believe, to our President of the Board of Tradedid not overlook the occurrence, and ordered our
friend to be immediately ground down in a <hi rend="italics">bakatata
kan</hi>, a kind of rudely-constructed sausage machine.</q></p>
  <p><q> But as he is here of course he escaped? </q></p>
  <p><q> Yes. The King of the Cobra Isles kindly intervened on his behalf. Negotiations were entered into

<pb id="p.203" n="203"/>




with some missionaries in the neighbourhood. Our
friend was ransomed at the cost of sixteen ounces of
coloured beads, four pounds of gunpowder, and a
bottle of rum.</q></p>
  <p>It is many years since this conversation took place,
so I cannot speak by the card. However, the above
is my impression of the incident, which may be more
or less right or more or less wrong.</p></div2>

  <p>Turning from the past to the present, a man may
make himself a lion by attracting attention by some
startling eccentricity. It matters very little what the
eccentricity is so that it be plain and distinct, and
consequently understandable by the people. For
instance, say that a candidate for lionship is a
<foreign lang="FR">litterateur</foreign>.  He has to invent a <foreign lang="FR">specialite</foreign>.  If
people have a general impression that virtue is a
matter that should be encouraged rather than not, he
should take up vice. This is managed more easily
nowadays than it was in the comparatively <q>long
ago.</q> Twenty years since plays that dealt with the
seventh commandment found little favour in the eyes
of the Reader for the Lord Chamberlain, and novels
that sailed dangerously near the wind, lacked subscriptions at the circulating libraries. This last practically meant ruin to the luckless publisher who took

<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>



the risk of a <q>tabooed</q> book. However, we are
more liberal-minded in the hours of the expiring
century, and <hi rend="italics">Formosa</hi> (once held up to horror as
the quintessence of the improper), is accepted as
quite <foreign lang="FR">bourgeois</foreign> in its humdrum respectability, and
<q> Paul Ferrol's Wife </q> (years ago a novel to be found
in the reserved part of Paterfamilias' bookshelves),
is suggestive of nothing more formidable than
<q>prunes and prisms.</q> The patronage of Vice either
on the stage or in the circulating library is already
becoming old-fashioned, but there is still enough life
in the mode to help a candidate for lionship to the
desired notability. All he has to do is to <q>go one
better</q> than the latest eccentricity. If Smith has
advocated manslaughter, Brown should strongly
recommend murder. But not common-place murder,
but fratricide or matricide. If Brown can be pointed
out as <q> the chap who wrote that book, don't you
know, proving that Faust was right enough in his
dealings with Marguerite</q> his fortune is made. The
theory will attract the proper amount of attention.
Hitherto it has been accepted that the rejuvenated
of Mephistopheles behaved rather badly to Gretchen.
Prove that both of them acted in the best possible
manner and all will be well. Critics will cry the book
up to the skies on the score that it is <q>intensely
human.</q> On my word, I would write the book
myself if I were not sure that either the subject has

<pb id="p.205" n="205"/>




been done, or that someone at this moment is doing
it. Years ago it would have been sufficient to prove
that Mephistopheles was not so black as he was
painted. But that kind of thing is rather out of date
-it ceased to be the fashion after the whitewashing
of Henry VIII., Judas, Judge Jeffries, and Pontius
Pilate.</p>
  <p>It may be safely laid down, as a rule, that if a man
can write something that is <q>bad</q> enough for the
reading of women, it will be good enough for the

  <p>If a man is an artist, and he wishes to become a
<soCalled>lion,</soCalled> I fancy that his best course is to go in for
<q>advanced impressionism.</q> I frankly admit that I
have never learned drawing, still recent compositions
on the hoardings and elsewhere have induced me to
believe that I might readily secure fame if I were to
adopt <q>advanced impressionism.</q> Out <persName key="Whistler, James A.M.">Whistler</persName>

paint mop. Nowadays, impressionists of the new
school seem to sprinkle whitewash on preparations
of Indian ink. After sprinkling they appear to look
at their handiwork with a view to selecting the title.
If there are three little spots in the centre of the

<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>




paper, then the sketch can be called <q> The Carnival at
Venice;</q> if only a blotch appears in the right-hand
corner, it may mean <q>Dante Meeting Virgil,</q> or
<q>Wellington Greeting Blucher,</q> or <q>The Lower
Thames.</q> In fact, the title doesn't matter in the
least-one is as good and as appropriate as another.
The last few lines may be accepted as a proof that I
have <q>no soul for art,</q> and consequently am an
incapable critic. Such an expression of opinion (if
largely circulated) would be most valuable. If I
could but establish my right to the title of <q> the most
incapable critic in the world,</q> I should become a lion
and get asked out everywhere. As an artist I feel
sure I should command instantaneous success. A
monthly  periodical  called  <hi rend="italics">The  Yellow  Book</hi>
recently attracted considerable attention. It was
full of weird drawings, that encouraged me to hope
that some day I shall be in the first rank of living
artists. I dropped some ink on a piece of paper a
day or so ago, and the shape the pigment took was
not unsuggestive of a spider or a "daddy long legs."
Rightly understood, I have not a doubt that my
composition accurately depicts <q> The Goodwin Sands
by Moonlight,</q> <q>St. Peter's on Easter Day,</q> or
<q> Romeo wedding Juliet.</q></p></div2>

 <p>But a candidate for lionship must not rest satisfied
with writing a book or painting a picture-he must
<q> dress for the part.</q> If he happens to be of
an inventive turn of mind he can do wonders.
For instance, why not smoke cigarettes made of vermilion

living ones for a buttonhole? Or why not (and this

eat green peas with your knife?</p>
  <p>A friend of mine, who was a thoroughly good
fellow and a clever man to boot, once thought he
might like to get into society. He wrote novels,
essays, and poems. They were praised by the critics,
but they did not get him talked about in what
<persName key="Thackeray, William Makepeace">Thackeray</persName> called <q>the upper suckles.</q> At length
his opportunity came. He was called by the Lord
Mayor of the period to attend a City banquet. He
attended in a velvet coat and a red necktie. This
affair got wind, was duly appreciated, and he became
at once fully qualified to appear as a lion of the

<p>WHEN the Season is commencing in the West-end

of the East. It is the mode to assume that Mr.
<q>'Enery 'Awkins,</q> and his friends, relatives, and

suggestive of patronage. I am not quite sure that we

Shoreditch and Hackney to organise a society to provide
the upper classes with amusements suitable to
their station. If they suddenly took the Westminster
Town Hall, or the rooms belonging to the Institute
of Painters in Water Colours, and invited the cultured
classes to <q> happy evenings </q> or <q> innocent afternoons,</q>
I fancy the said cultured classes would smile contemptuously
at the impertinence. The smile would
not become more respectful if the Coster Committee

<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>





explained that their object was to keep <q>the Pall

<div2 n="THE EARLIEST CLUBS FOR THE WORKING MAN" type="subchapter" id="s142"><head>THE EARLIEST CLUBS FOR <q>THE WORKING MAN.</q></head>

  <p>I am not quite sure when <q>the movement</q> commenced.
Years and years ago a society was organised to
establish <q> working men's clubs.</q> It was
assumed by the founders that the artisan, however
bright he might be in pursuing his own calling, had
yet scarcely sufficient intelligence to look after himself
in the hours of non-labour. The builder, the mason,
and the bricklayer were consequently invited to
spacious buildings opened for their benefit wherein
the greatest dissipation consisted of bagatelle and in
which the cellar was stocked with no more intoxicating drinks than lemonade, gingerbeer, and soda
water. The excellent-intentioned people who issued
the invitations to the working men soon found they
had made a mistake. The club, with its bagatelle
board and temperance drinks had no chance against
the tavern with its bright appointments and stimulants.
So it soon went to the wall. The movement,
I am afraid, did more harm than good, inasmuch as
the lesson was learned with a view to future development.
When the goody-goody clubs disappeared

<pb id="p.211" n="211"/>






others devoted to deep drinking and gambling took
their place. I fancy that many of the <foreign lang="FR">cercles</foreign> now
attracting special attention of the police are the outcome of the scheme for improving the leisure hours
of the people. The working man resented the irritating patronage of those who considered themselves
his <q>pastors and masters</q>; so, instead of playing
chess and sipping milk and water he went in for
betting and the unlimited consumption of spirits. And
I am afraid that he had general sympathy. Charles
<persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> in his novels and stories never lost an opportunity of ridiculing the imitation philanthropists.
Albert Smith, too, was particularly hard upon the
patrons of the poorer classes. In his performances
at the Egyptian Hall he delivered many a sly dig at
this painstaking community, and ultimately raised a
perfect storm of remonstrances by saying that the
enthusiasts in China had only one convert-a billiard
marker-whose piety was more likely to be the product
of cash than any nobler consideration. Both <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName>
and Albert Smith were entirely opposed to <q> gentlefolk
patronage,</q> and there was not a single writer
who took up the cudgels on the behalf of <q> the other
side.</q></p></div2>

      <div2 n="QUEEN VICTORIA'S OWN THEATRE" type="subchapter" id="s143"><head><q>QUEEN VICTORIA'S OWN THEATRE.</q></head>

  <p>Perhaps the boldest attempt at entertaining the
East-enders was made when a philanthropist converted

<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>



the Victoria Theatre (built the Royal Coburg) into
a temperance music-hall. The old playhouse has a
history. It was erected in the days of George IV.,
and the name Coburg was a recognition of the connection existing between the Royal Family and the
German Duke of that ilk. If I am not wrong in my
history, I think it was christened in honour of the
Princess Charlotte's marriage with the King of the
Belgians. Leaving it to members of the Society of
Antiquaries to set me right, I may say that the Coburg was opened with great pomp.   The lessee,
my maternal grandfather, Mr. Joseph Glossop, was
connected with the Court as a gentleman-at-arms.
He was Clerk of the Cheque and Exon of that
illustrious and valiant body.  With this influence
behind him he contrived to have the theatre opened
by one of the Royal Dukes-I fancy by the Duke of
Gloucester. One of the features of the inauguration
ceremony was the first appearance of the celebrated
<q> looking-glass curtain.</q> This drop was composed of
fairly large mirrors, which unfortunately had been
disfigured by the impressions of the dirty hands of
the stage carpenters. When it was disclosed to view
there was a roar of laughter. For instead of being
impressed the audience were much amused to see
their own presentments. After the <q> house </q> had inspected itself for some minutes, a boy in the gallery
called out, <q>And now show us something prettier.</q>

<pb id="p.213" n="213"/>



Of course this suggestion elicited a shout of merriment, and the curtain was voted more of a joke than
a marvel. Later on the name of the playhouse was
changed from the Coburg to the Victoria, and lost its
<foreign lang="FR">cachet</foreign>. Some twenty years ago it was the home of
that sort of melodrama which is best suited to the
tastes of the inhabitants of the New Cut. A little
later there was an effort made to revive it as a
music-hall on the lines of the Empire, the Alhambra, and
the Canterbury. It did not do, and consequently has
been converted into a Palace of Philanthropy. The
poorer classes, at a nominal rate of admission, are
entertained with a very select music-hall programme.
At first Shakespearean readings were attempted, but
the audience called for something else, and their needs
were supplied. I believe the undertaking, thanks to
the efforts of a benevolent lady who devotes much of
her time to its management, is now doing very well
indeed. I have not heard much about it of late, as
South of the Thames is not my beat.</p>

  <p>But perhaps the amateur companies are the latest
fashion. The Victoria has, I fancy, a professional
staff, and consequently is unlike the voluntary associations in the East End. It was my good fortune
a short while since to be present at a concert organised
with the view of amusing certain young men cooperating


<pb id="p.214" n="214"/>





for their own improvement in the neighbourhood of a well-known city church. The function
was held in a highly-decorated room, redolent of
illuminated texts, and the company was distinctly
select. A clergyman presided, and in the front row
were a number of people well known <q> further west.</q>
The programme was a good one. We had some excellent songs sung by two professionals who had
kindly volunteered their services, and a host of
auxiliary talent. One gentleman did wonders with a
banjo. I never heard a more refined rendering of
negro minstrelsy in my life. The gentleman uttered
his <q>wheezes</q> (I believe that is the technical term
for those mirth-provoking jokes that find so much
favour in the Great St. James's Hall) in a manner that
would have been entirely appropriate to the Row or
the stalls at the opera.</p>
  <p>"You see," he said to me afterwards, <q>I felt
slightly out of it, and could not let them off with
much spirit. It is really very difficult to say 'golly,
golly' properly unless you are wearing three feet
shirt collars and a black face. As I was in my customary evening-dress I am afraid the exclamation
sounded a little flat. Don't you think so? </q></p>
  <p><q>Not at all, </q>I returned, <q>nothing could have been
in better taste. The clergyman who presided was
delighted, in spite of the fact that he had torn himself
away from a confirmation class to listen to you.</q></p>

<pb id="p.215" n="215"/>





  <p>Besides the gentleman with a banjo, we heard a
reciter who told us gruesome tales (in blank verse)
about starved paupers and <q> the daughters of despair.</q>
Further, one talented individual recited a Tommy
Atkins' Barrack Ballad in the most faultless fashion.
Seeing ladies present, he dropped his voice at words
referring to the infernal regions and a condition of
the atmosphere that would have excited the suspicion
of an inspector of nuisances. But the hero of the
evening was unquestionably my friend with the banjo,
and when he sang a song with a rattling chorus, and
appealed to the audience to join in it, the applause
was absolutely deafening. The function was altogether
a pleasant one, and we congratulated ourselves
all round upon having kept our humble friends the
juvenile Christians well employed.</p></div2>


          <div2 n="A DISCUSSION WITHOUT MUSIC" type="subchapter" id="s145"><head>A DISCUSSION WITHOUT MUSIC.</head>

  <p>Thanks to the kind invitation of a very old friend
of mine, I was present some little while ago at another
entertainment organised for the benefit of the poorer
classes at the East End. On this occasion we had
no songs, but a lecturer who dealt with matters of
history from his own standpoint. The address was
one of a series, and dealt with subjects not uncalculated
to cause heated discussion. The audience was
distinctly mixed, and cheers and counter-cheers were

<pb id="p.216" n="216"/>



frequently heard during the course of the oration.
However, excellent order was maintained, and <q>fair
play</q> seemed to be the motto of the meeting. At
the end of the address questions were submitted to
the lecturer, which he proceeded to answer with the
most perfect good temper, although some of them
might have been couched in politer language. When
the speaker had to admit a <q>palpable hit</q> the <q> retort courteous</q> was received with roars of laughter.
When I heard what was to be the subject of the paper
I had feared an angry altercation, possibly not confined entirely to words. To my pleased surprise I
noticed that although the audience was divided in
opinion, there was no sign of violence.</p>
  <p><q> Remember, my good friends,</q> said one of the
gentlemen on the platform, <q> that we respect the two
T's-tolerance and temper. So now that we have
done our palavering let us shake hands all round and
say good night.</q></p>
  <p>The hint was immediately accepted, and with a
hearty cheer for the lecturer the meeting quietly
separated.</p></div2>

  <p>The result of my peregrinations in the East has
convinced me, that thanks to the march of education
or from some other equally excellent cause, the working

<pb id="p.217" n="217"/>



man at the end of the Century is far more
good-natured and far more easily pleased than his predecessors. He does not like to be patronised, and
delights in taking part in the proceedings of the
evening. On one occasion a not very wise chairman,
with a military title, was inclined to be dictatorial.</p>
  <p><q> Don't you be so arbitrary,</q> shouted one of the
audience. <q>We ain't children, nor yet slaves. We
know how to behave, so don't <hi rend="italics">you</hi> try to ride
rough-shod over us.</q></p>
  <p>And this seemed to me the universal sentiment.
I do not believe that the modern working man is in
the least ungrateful, but he reads the newspapers nowadays,
and with their assistance <q> thinks a thing out.</q></p>
<p>He thoroughly appreciates the efforts of those who
show him the way how to enjoy himself in a rational
manner, but I fancy that he has already a suspicion
that, if needs be, he can get on without the
kindly-meant assistance. In the words of the remonstrator
who pulled up the dragooning chairman, <q> he is neither
a child nor a slave.</q> Before we are far advanced in
the new century I fancy the working man will be
seen progressing alone, and if matters do not mend
in what Jeames de la Plushe used to call the <q> Upper
Suckles</q> it is not improbable in the years to come
that the East will visit the West, instead of waiting
to be visited.</p></div2>

<p>NOT very long since it was my privilege and pleasure
to be present at a modern reproduction of the famed
Vauxhall Gardens. The occasion was the first of a
series of Fancy Dress Balls at the Royal Opera,
<placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>. By offering handsome prizes to the
conventionally careless throng the management had
caused that frivolous company to become exceedingly
thoughtful. I have been told that for weeks, and
even months, before the ball, those who intend to
compete for <q>the gifts of Druriolanus</q> had been
busy in devising elaborate costumes. On the occasion
I noticed a number of excellent assumptions
that must have been the outcome of unlimited reflection
and not a little imagination. As I watched some
most complicated <q>make-ups </q> passing by, I frankly
admit that I could not understand how their inventors
had come to scheme them out. I felt inclined

<pb id="p.219" n="219"/>





to observe (repeating a remark that has been
frequently addressed to myself when I have had the
pleasure of taking a lady down to dinner), I could
not <q> conceive how they came to think of such clever
things.</q></p></div2>

            <div2 n="INCONVENIENT COSTUMES" type="subchapter" id="s148"><head>INCONVENIENT COSTUMES.</head>

  <p>Of course, those who desire to compete for prizes
at <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName> will have to expend a good deal
of ingenuity, and possibly no little expense, in
contriving a dress likely to attract the favourable notice
of the powers that be. I have seen before now a
gentleman labouring slowly through a giddy throng
in the substantial costume of a bust upon a pedestal,
and another masker in the garb of a lay figure. The
latter was extremely well conceived and carried out.
But those who make these attempts after realism
should be blessed with the best of good tempers. I
frankly confess that I have never appeared as an
artist's model myself, and I have no desire to try my
luck in such an assumption. I have been credibly
informed that he who appears as an animated
life-sized doll has to display considerable dexterity in
preserving his balance, for a push accidental or the
reverse may upset his equilibrium. Such a disastrous
pressure is calculated to cause an angry remonstrance
from the meekest of men, and savage words
emanating from a benevolent mask are likely to

<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>



produce more laughter than sympathy. Many years
ago, when I was allowed to appear in amateur
theatricals, I was permitted to fill the not
very important <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of <q>Zoyland the Blacksmith,</q> in <hi rend="italics">A
Sheep in Wolf's Clothing</hi>. Thinking that my excellent
abilities had been unfairly ignored, I introduced
a little <q>comic business</q> into my part that
certainly would have provoked the hostile criticism
of the author, my valued friend, the late Tom Taylor.
A relative who was <q> got up </q> as a dissolute trooper
in Percy Kirke's <q> ambs</q> offered a remonstrance and
told me in irate tones <q> not to play the fool.</q> These
<q> angry </q> words, spoken by a gentleman whose face
(with the kind assistance of the Clarkson of the
period) bore a stereotyped drunken grin, were
irresistibly comic, and deeply as I regretted that I
should have given him just cause for complaint, I
could not help indulging in exuberant merriment.
The more he stormed the more I roared, and had we
been a few years younger I fear that the interview
would have ended with fisticuffs. So I have reasons
for counselling those who adopt elaborate or eccentric
toilettes to keep their temper. It is almost impossible
(under provocation) to preserve a dignified demeanour if you happen to be successfully suggesting
a village pump or a humanised lobster. Even
Macready made up as <q>a picnic luncheon</q> would
have been at a disadvantage in the midst of a crowd

<pb id="p.221" n="221"/>





of <foreign lang="FR">farceurs</foreign> wearing the <q>modest simplicity</q> of
modern evening dress. At least, such is my opinion
after reading the life of the Great Tragedian. But,
of course, I offer that opinion for what it is worth.</p></div2>


       <div2 n="SIMPLICITY VERSUS ECCENTRICITY" type="subchapter" id="s149"><head>SIMPLICITY VERSUS ECCENTRICITY.</head>

  <p>I have been told that the simplest costume is the
best for a private fancy ball. The first dress of
Claude Melnotte in <hi rend="italics">The Lady of Lyons</hi>, is an excellent
example of the simple combined with the
effective. All you require is a <q>jumper,</q> a belt, blue
trousers, and gaiters worn over your shoes. But
simplicity can be carried too far. A friend of mine
once went to a costume gathering as the Ghost in
<hi rend="italics">The Corsican Brothers</hi>. All he had to do was to take
off his dress-coat and waistcoat and paint a bloodstain
on the left side of his shirt over the region of
his heart. But the effect was rather repulsive, and
before the end of the evening I found the deceased
Louis dei Franchi hiding behind curtains, and in
other ways attempting to escape observation. On
the occasion to which I refer I appeared myself as a
Crusader, and I thanked my lucky stars that I had
not lived in the time of Peter the Hermit, as I
certainly should have shrunk from visiting Palestine in
such an embarrassing costume. The weight of chain
armour is enormous, and if you do the thing

<pb id="p.222" n="222"/>



thoroughly, and allow the chains to cover the
soles of your feet, dancing of the most elementary
quadrille becomes next to an impossibility.
The dress itself was certainly imposing.
It had been lent to me by the late Mr. Alfred
German Reed, and had been worn by Mr. A.
W. Law in a <q> first part</q> at the St. George's
Hall-the site of the far-famed <q>entertainment</q> after the
clever "illustrators" had migrated from  their first
home, <q>the Gallery of Illustration.</q>  The costume
was perfect. One of the details was a heavy helmet
of the saucepan-minus-handle order of sartorial
architecture. This head-covering caused me infinite
trouble. If I put it on it tumbled off, and if I laid it
on a seat it was sure to be the cause of considerable
inconvenience to those who rested without
noticing its presence. I remember that it was the
means of making <q>a professional beauty </q> adopt an
expression never seen in any of her numerous <foreign lang="FR">cartes
de visite</foreign>.  Another drawback to the Crusader's
armour was the facility with which the wearer
dropped his rings. I found that my peregrinations
could be easily traced by my steel castings. Under
these circumstances I cannot conscientiously recommend
the costume of <q> Richard Coeur de Lion</q> to
anyone who values peace and comfort.</p>
  <p>Another awkward dress is the habit of a
North-American Indian. When I was a young man I was

<pb id="p.223" n="223"/>





pursuaded by a friend to appear as <q>a chief </q> in a long
leather robe, a complicated headgear of eagle's
feathers, and  moccasins. To <q>keep  up   the
character</q> I was induced to stain my face. I
certainly escaped recognition, and had the further
advantage of hearing myself called <q> that melancholy
idiot looking like a dying parrot;</q> but these pleasures
were scarcely sufficient to compensate for the nuisance
of being universally avoided by dancers as well as
wall-flowers. At the time I was editing a London
evening paper, and left the ball (it was held at
Brighton) by an early train for the metropolis. I
had no time to change my costume before meeting
my sub-editor, and I shall never forget the look of
surprise on the face of the late Mr. Brockwell Dalton
when I asked him <q> to kindly give me the proof of
the leaders.</q></p></div2>

  <p>In the olden days juvenile revellers were rather
fond of the costume of Charles II. I refer to the
period when moustaches were unknown to the upper
lips of anyone outside the commissioned ranks of
the cavalry. The representatives of his late Majesty
of festive memory had to wear false hair, and I can
just remember that such an ornament is distinctly
inconvenient. The heat of the ball-room generally

<pb id="p.224" n="224"/>




melted the gum, and one had to be constantly reaffixing the hirsute appendage. I am able to declare
from experience that it is no easy matter to take
supper in a false moustache. It interferes with the
soup, disagrees with the <foreign lang="FR">mayonnaise</foreign>, and intercepts
the champagne. Besides a melancholy <persName key="Charles II.">Charles II</persName>.
although, possibly, historically accurate, is a dismal
sight in the ball-room. Albert Smith, and (I think)
Horace Mayhew, wrote much of the <foreign lang="FR">bals masques</foreign> of
their day, and invariably selected as a type of the
saddest of the sad, a woe-begone representative of
the <q>merry monarch.</q> So I think I may insist on
the assertion, that if a man elects to go to a fancy
dress ball as a <q>gay cavalier,</q> he should at least be
naturally cheerful. It is the sort of costume that
might have been appropriately worn by Mark Tapley.</p></div2>

  <p>It is a little dangerous to talk of ladies' dresses.
Powder always looks well, and it may be conceded
that the female representatives of the human race
usually appear more charming than their lords if not
masters. Still there may be drawbacks to the costumes
chosen by our woman kind. If Esmeralda
accepts the accompaniment of a goat (either real or
stuffed) the disadvantage is obvious; and Marguerite,
if she insists upon bringing with her the spinning

<pb id="p.225" n="225"/>



wheel, will also be (as much as any lady can be) a
nuisance. Then it is rather embarrassing when a
female friend counts upon <q>realising</q> a well-known
picture. If she wears a white wig and carries a
flower you may safely suggest <q>The Lost Duchess
of Devonshire </q>-now, by the way, slightly out of
date-and a ruff and black velvet are strongly
presumptive of a desire to reproduce <q>Mary Queen of
Scots on her way to Execution.</q> But when you
have hazarded these fairly safe assumptions there is
considerable danger in guessing anything else.</p>
  <p><q>Who am I? </q> a lady asked me (in questionable
grammar) not very long ago.</p>
  <p>I pondered, and noticed that she was wearing
flowing flaxen hair, a brown gown, <foreign lang="FR">gants de suede</foreign>,
and diamonds. I remembered that she had a boy at
Eton, and deferentially suggested <q> Lady Macbeth.</q></p>
 <p><q> Oh, no! </q> she exclaimed. <q>What an idea! Try
again.</q></p>
  <p>Then I looked at her once more, and yet again.
She had no ruff, so she would not be <q> Mary Queen
of Scots,</q> and her flowing wavy tresses negatived
the presumption that she was the Lost Duchess, so I
<q>gave it up.</q></p>
  <p><q>Why, <q>'Cinderella in the kitchen,'</q></q> she replied.
<q>Millais' picture, you know. You would have recognised me at once if you had seen my broom. But I
have left it in a corner with my bouquet.</q></p>

<pb id="p.226" n="226"/>



  <p>And then I admitted that had I seen the broom I
should have had a better chance. And so I should.</p></div2>


    <div2 n="EASY, EFFECTIVE, AND NOT EXPENSIVE" type="subchapter" id="s152"><head>EASY, EFFECTIVE, AND NOT EXPENSIVE.</head>

  <p>And now I feel that, after all, I have not said very
much about the best costume that a man can adopt
for a fancy dress ball. All that is required are a few
yards of gold lace, a theatrical star, and a fez. Get
into your evening dress, and exchange your tail coat
for a frock. Next pin or tack a strip of gold lace to
the outer seams of your trousers. Turn up your
collar, and put more gold lace on the inside, which
will now become the outside. Put gold lace round
the cuffs and at the back, and (if you like) bind with
the same material. Put on your star on the left
breast and assume your fez. Having done this, wear
a pair of blue spectacles, and you may safely call
yourself the late Khedive. If you want to be <q> quite
too good,</q> add a white cotton umbrella lined with
green, and the assumption will be <q> simply perfect.</q></p>
  <p>So I may sum up my advice to those about to go
to a fancy dress ball, with the recommendation, when
in doubt about the choice of a costume-spoil the
Egyptian!</p></div2>

<p>WHEN the House is <q>up</q> and the members of the
Ministry are more or less <q>scattered,</q> it might be
expected that oratory would take (to use the slang of
the day) <q> a back seat.</q> But this is far from the case.
Of late years the representatives of the people have
used the recess for airing their eloquence in the
presence of their constituents. The practice has found
favour in the eyes of the conductors of the press, for
almost anything is <q> good for copy </q> in the silly season.
So <q>extra parliamentary utterances</q> have become
quite welcome in October, and are sure of a hearty
greeting at the hands, or rather the pens, of editors
of all shades of political opinion. Under these
circumstances it may not be entirely out of place to
devote a chapter to the consideration of speech-making,
the more especially as no Englishman, while residing
in his native country, is safe from receiving an
invitation at any time and almost on every occasion <q> to say

<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>



a few words </q> to those assembled before him.
Speech-making is as popular at the end of the century.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="EXTRA PARLIAMENTARY UTTERANCES" type="subchapter" id="s154"><head>EXTRA PARLIAMENTARY UTTERANCES.</head>

  <p>I have spoken of parliamentary orators, and although I have never had the honour of sitting
officially on the benches of the House during business,
still I have had the pleasure and privilege of counting
amongst my friends many M.P.'s. These gentlemen
are supposed by their constituents to be full of eloquence, and so even if their remarks in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
have been confined to an occasional <q> hear, hear,</q> and
an even scarcer cry of <q> question,</q> they are expected
to give a taste of their quality when they get back to
the voters they left (during the session) behind them.
Nowadays it is not easy to pack a meeting, and even
if it were it is not always expedient. There is nothing
like making use of the safety-valve, and it is sometimes wiser to let your opponents <q>have it out with
you </q> in public rather than in private, especially when
privacy means a long correspondence in the local
press.</p>
  <p><q>I rather enjoy meeting my constituents face to
face,</q> said one of my parliamentary friends the other
day. <q>At any rate I am sure of a respectful hearing
for the first quarter of an hour, and that is more than
I ever get at St. Stephen's.</q></p>

<pb id="p.229" n="229"/>





  <p>Then he told me that he got up his repartees for
the occasion. He knew that he would be sure to
meet a certain jocular cobbler, who was eqully certain
of causing a good deal of interruption.</p>
  <p><q>I do not dislike the old fellow,</q> continued my
friend, <q>and I fancy that he has a kind of respect for
me. But when we meet as <quote>'man to man'</quote> (a favourite
phrase of his), it is necessary that we should fight as
hard as we can. He is sure to put any number of
awkward questions, and it will be my task to answer
them airily and wittily on the spur of the moment.
Here is a list of them. I shall have the answers cut,
dried, and polished before the night of the meeting.
There is nothing like getting up your <hi rend="italics">impromptus</hi>
well in advance.</q></p>
  <p>My friend was rather anxious, for he had lost one
of his greatest supporters, a gentleman habitually
described by the chairman as <q> Mr. Jones from London.</q> This important personage was unable to come
to the meeting, and the M.P. said he did not know
how he should get on without him.</p>
  <p><q> You see,</q> said he, <q> he knows how to get at the
hearts of the poorer classes. Really when I have
heard him describing the noble fight for existence
amongst the lower orders, I have been moved almost
to tears. He has convinced me over and over again
that it is the duty of those who have cash to share it
with those who have it not. If it were not that I

<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>




know that he does not live up to his principles, I
should be ashamed to meet him.   However, as a
matter of fact, although a rich man he carefully avoids
wasting his cash on charity. But on the platform he
is first rate-Wilberforce and Howard rolled into one.</q></p>
  <p><q>How does he find time to attend meetings ?</q></p>
  <p><q>Oh, he has plenty of leisure.  He makes his
money by keeping a pawnbroker's shop and renting
the squalidest sort of common lodging-houses.</q></p>
  <p>From these admissions I venture to think that
political meetings in the provinces (and, if it comes to
that, in London too) must not be absolutely earnest
and entirely convincing.</p></div2>


   <div2 n="SPEAKERS AT THE END OF THE CENTURY" type="subchapter" id="s155"><head>SPEAKERS AT THE END OF THE CENTURY.</head>

   <p>I suppose everyone has heard at some time or
another the most prominent speakers of the day.
Mr. <persName key="Gladstone, Herbert">Gladstone</persName> until the end retained his wonderful
silver-toned voice and his earnest manner. The last
time I had the opportunity of listening to the great
statesman he was apparently heart and soul interested
in some question about the wine duties. He had not
been expected to speak, but was sitting with his head
resting amidst his collars (shirt and coat), with his
hands clasping his elbows. He was perfectly motionless, but his eyes were bright and piercing.</p>
  <p><q> He will be up directly,</q> said a friend beside me,

<pb id="p.231" n="231"/>





and my friend was right. All of a sudden Mr. <persName key="Gladstone, Herbert">Gladstone</persName> sprang to his feet and poured forth a flood of
earnest eloquence about something or other connected
with bottles. At this date I have not the faintest
idea what it was all about, but I know that at the
time I was deeply moved, and had I had to vote
should have certainly followed the right hon.
gentleman into his favourite lobby.  I was completely carried away by his evident earnestness-for
the moment I honestly believed that the fate of my
country, nay, the fate of the universe, depended upon
something or other connected with bottles!</p>
  <p>The last time I heard Lord Beaconsfield speak
was at Willis's Rooms in the days of the old building.
We had been called together to consider the advisability of erecting a statue to Lord <persName key="Byron, George Gordon">Byron</persName>, and the
platform was occupied by several eminent ecclesiastics. There were, to the best of my recollection,
an archbishop and two or three bishops, and plenty
of deans, archdeacons, and such small clerical deer.
Lord Beaconsfield was received with enthusiasm. He
made a capital speech. I could not help contrasting
his style-his calm measured sentences-with the
dash and go of his great parliamentary rival. As
earnestness was the essence of Mr. <persName key="Gladstone, Herbert">Gladstone</persName>'s oratory, so was polished epigram the <q>stock</q> of Disraeli's carefully considered utterances.  The great
Conservative was delightfully calm. He was always

<pb id="p.232" n="232"/>



dignified, and even when flippant distinctly majestic.
I remember that on the occasion to which I refer he
made a point which convulsed the audience the moment it was understood.</p>
  <p><q>I do not pretend to defend all the faults of the
poet's private character. It is unfortunately common
knowledge that he was a libertine.  But then, my
Lords and gentlemen,</q> said Dizzy, turning to the
archbishop, bishops, and the remainder of the clerics,
<q><hi rend="italics"> we have all been young</hi>! </q></p>
  <p>The speaker spoke perfectly gravely. For a moment
there was a silence, and then when the audience
took the point, came a shout of applause and a roar
of laughter. The idea of suggesting the possibility
that so eminently a respectful company might have
found themselves in the same boat with the peccadilloes
of Lord <persName key="Byron, George Gordon">Byron</persName> was too lovely for words!
</p></div2>

       <div2 n="ARCHBISHOP MAGEE AND OTHERS" type="subchapter" id="s156"><head>ARCHBISHOP MAGEE AND OTHERS.</head>

  <p>Amongst other orators of the past I call to
mind Archbishop Magee, who was, I suppose, at the
time of his lamented death, one of the finest (if not
the finest) speakers that the House of Lords could
boast. The last time I heard the prelate address an
audience was at a charity dinner in connection with
the Artists' Benevolent Fund. His address was a
model one. Nothing could have been better than the

<pb id="p.233" n="233"/>




contrast of light and shade. Now he was causing
roars of laughter, now bringing unbidden tears to
eyes generally free from such a sign of womanly
weakness. He took advantage of his nationality to
refer to the well known love of the Irish people for
peace, and their equally marked aversion to anything
connected with <q>a row.</q> He said that he was a
lover of harmony, not only as an ecclesiastic, but as
a native of the Emerald Isle. Then he described a
beautiful picture that he had seen during the season
hanging to the walls of Burlington House. It was a
sketch of the calm and silvery Thames. The sun
was setting, and the atmosphere spoke eloquently
of rest and solitude.</p>
  <p><q>When I gazed upon this lovely painting,</q> said his
Grace, or rather his Lordship, for he then was only
Bishop of Peterborough, <q>I felt that even curates
might play with me with impunity! </q></p>
  <p>Then another admirable speaker was the late
Charles <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName>, whose orations have since his death
been gathered together in a single volume, which is
quite worthy of taking its place on the shelf reserved
for his novels. <persName key="Thackeray, William Makepeace">Thackeray</persName> never cared for oratory,
and preferred to write rather than to talk-at a public
meeting. As a conversationalist he was admirable,
and was the feature of the Garrick Club when that
brilliant crowd of clever men foregathered in the old
quarters at <placeName key="King Street">King Street</placeName>, <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>. Sir Edward

<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>



Bulwer Lytton, afterwards Lord Lytton, and the
father of the late <q> Owen Meredith,</q> <q> read better than
he wrote.</q> His delivery was extremely artificial, and
he found considerable difficulty in modulating his
voice, no doubt because he suffered from the infirmity
of deafness. I remember seeing him at the old Portland
Club, in the days when that <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> was situated
at the corner of Stafford Place, Oxford Street. As
a rule whist was negotiated in silence, but on the
occasion to which I refer there had been such extremely
bad play on the part of one of the quartette,
that at the end of the rubber there was considerable
<q>reclamation.</q> Hot words were spoken that a hundred
years earlier might have led to a matutinal visit
to Chalk Farm. But Lord Lytton heeded them not.
He sat like a statue, unmindful of their utterance.
Both Lyndhurst and Brougham learned their speeches
by heart before they delivered them, and Lord John
Russell was the last of the statesmen who used the old
pronunciation for <q> oblige,</q> invariably calling the word
<q>oblege.</q></p></div2>

  <div2 n="SOME PERSONAGES IN THE LOWER HOUSE" type="subchapter" id="s157"><head> SOME PERSONAGES IN THE LOWER HOUSE.</head>
   <p>Thanks to scores of reporters, we know the
characteristics of all the speeches of most of our modern
statesmen. The <q> Devonshire yawn</q> has taken the
place of the <q> Hartington slumber,</q> marking
the elevation of the popular statesman from the Commons

<pb id="p.235" n="235"/>




to the Peers. Mr. Goschen, when he has no notes,
and can speak without a paper held close to his pince
nez, is also a favourable specimen of the talent of the
House of Commons. Mr. Arthur Balfour has just a
touch of the Hartington-Devonshire weariness. He
is very much on the alert when seated in his place,
but the moment he rises to address the House he
seems just a trifle lackadaisical. This was particularly noticeable when he was engaged a few years
ago in answering the questions of the Irish members.
Mr. Chamberlain has a <soCalled>smooth</soCalled> manner, but his
smoothness is not unsuggestive of the calm of oil of
vitriol. Mr. Labouchere smiles sweetly when he says
the absurdest things; and Colonel Saunderson beams
with good nature when he delivers his most pointed
sallies. Nowadays we have no wags. For some time
Sir Wilfrid Lawson was accepted as a wit, but I am
afraid of late his humour has been considered as much
out of date as the good things of the late Mr. Joseph
Miller. Dr. Wallace before his lamented death was
coming to the front as a humorist. His claim to
be considered one of the House's <q> funny men </q> was
neither allowed nor disallowed.</p></div2>

         <div2 n="THE PARLIAMENTARY MANNER" type="subchapter" id="s158"><head>THE PARLIAMENTARY MANNER.</head>
  <p>I have been told, for I cannot speak from experience as I have never had the honour of sitting in
the House myself, that <q> the parliamentary manner</q>

<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>




is everything. Young fellows who have come fresh
from the <q>U.D.C.'s</q> of Oxford and Cambridge,
unless they can catch the mode are nowhere. Many
a man who has made a reputation even in oratory
outside the House has lost it the moment he has
passed the portals guarded by the Serjeant-at-Arms.
And a first impression is very important. A man very
frequently does more in his initial couple of sessions
than in his whole parliamentary career. If he fails
he falls like Lucifer never to rise again. An <q>old
Parliamentary hand</q> once told me that a first oration
should be short and good, so that the rest of the
House might ask for more. The <q>member of the
maiden speech</q> should know his subject well and
have something to say worthy of attention. If possible, it should be new and certainly true. The day
may come when the good young man may enhance
his reputation by laying himself open to correction,
and then pave the way to that most popular of performances, <q> a personal explanation.</q> And at first he
should be as reliable as <hi rend="italics">Truth</hi> (<hi rend="italics">the</hi> person <hi rend="italics">and</hi> the

generally-parliamentary, municipal, and social-but

<pb id="p.237" n="237"/>





I find that I have already exhausted my patience in
touching upon the first branch of the subject. However, that I may get away from the Theatre Royal,
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, to the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, and
(old) Prince of Wales's I refer to two pieces that contained speeches supposed to be delivered by candidates for parliamentary honours. The first was a play
at <q>the little house,</q> in which Mr. Charles Mathews
took part. He acted as an agent, and Buckstone was
in the cast. The old Haymarket company supplied
the remainder of the <foreign lang="LA">dramatis personae</foreign>. I fancy that
Buckstone was the fugleman of a band of voters
whose opinions were emphasised with bludgeons.
They were called <q>lambs,</q> and existed long before
the days of the Nottingham scandals. If my memory
does not play me false, the piece was called <hi rend="italics">The
Contested Election</hi>.  Then there was a piece by
Mark Lemon called, strangely enough, <hi rend="italics">The Member
for Wrottenborough</hi>, and of course Tom Robertson's
<hi rend="italics">Society</hi>.  In the last I first saw Sir Squire Bancroft, who played Sydney Daryll long before his
charming wife had changed her name from Wilton to
Bancroft. No one noticed the Squire's <q>drawl</q> in
those distant days, but then the popular actor had
yet to play Captain Hawtree in <hi rend="italics">Caste</hi>. I remember
the effect of the speech at the end of <hi rend="italics">Society</hi>
spoken <q>off.</q>  Bancroft's voice was accepted as
pathetic, without a trace of the <q> swelldom</q> that was

<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>



its chief characteristic when he appeared as the
extra-heavy dragoon, and the oration <q>went</q>
with thunders of applause. Time has thinned the old cast.
<q>Johnnie</q> Clarke and Dewar have joined the
majority, but we still have the Bancrofts and Hare.
<hi rend="italics">Society</hi> must have been produced some thirty years
ago, and <hi rend="italics">The Contested Election</hi> (written if I am
not wrong by Tom Taylor) a decade or two earlier.
Of the cast of the last I fancy none remain-the last
to go were Mrs. Charles Mathews and Mr. Henry
Howe.</p></div2>

<p>Two Sundays in April a large number of people
(they are called <q>smart</q> in the Society journals)
spend their time in visiting Chelsea and St. John's
Wood in search of the pearls of the studios.  A
great many of them possibly know as little about
art as anything else, and the vast majority probably
make the customary rounds because it is the thing
to do. A select few, no doubt, are actuated by
nobler motives. These genuine lovers of pictures
put in an appearance to see their favourites' work
before the canvases are annexed by Burlington
House and the New Gallery. After all, the best
place of inspection for a painting is the studio.
When it is resting on its easel all its beauties can be
fully recognised, especially should its author be in
attendance. It is placed in the best light, and incongruous neighbours are warned off. No doubt the

Hanging Committee of the Royal Academy and the
Managing Directors of the New Gallery do their best
to secure appropriate surroundings to all the works
entrusted to their care; still accidents will happen.
If one painting is killed by another, and a third is
rendered ridiculous by the presence of a fourth, the
excuse must be that space is limited, and bad hanging (from an artist's point of view) is better than no
hanging at all. So given that the best place in
which to see a picture is its native studio, and an
excuse is found for the crowds who congregate in
Chelsea and the Regent Park during the April
Sundays.</p></div2>

           <div2 n="THE DIGNITY OF ART" type="subchapter" id="s161"> <head>THE DIGNITY OF ART.</head>

  <p>As I write there is no more enviable position
in the wide world than the Presidentship of
the Royal Academy.    A  season or two ago I
happened to be present at the meeting of two
Royal Academicians in the rooms at St. James's
Palace.  They were both in Court dress, and
both had paid their respects to the Representative of their Sovereign.  They looked and were
cultured and comely gentlemen. Amidst the glittering throng of scarlet and blue uniforms the two
members of the Royal Academy more than held
their own. They were <foreign lang="FR">excessivement distingue</foreign>.
And I could not help contrasting with these

<pb id="p.241" n="241"/>





admirable representatives of modern English art
the sort of worker that found his pictorial embodiment
in Keene's sketch of <q> Stodge.</q> The painter
of twenty or thirty years ago was a Bohemian <foreign lang="FR">pur
et simple</foreign>. He had hosts of friends, and these
friends chaffed him unmercifully if he showed the
slightest inclination to go <q>into the world.</q> If a
man appeared after dark in a studio in evening dress,
he was held up to ridicule as <q>a swell;</q> if he
accepted an invitation to stay a week or so at a
country house he was regarded with real concern as
a dangerous madman. Charles Keene's "Stodge"
was the companion sketch to Tom Robertson's
<q>Stylus.</q> The latter was the <q>literary hack</q> of
Bohemia. They both were thoroughly good fellows
-in the best sense of the word gentlemen-but I
am afraid, from a society point of view, just a little
<q>impossible.</q>  Nowadays <q>Stodge</q> is all that he
should be, and <q> Stylus</q> is nothing that he shouldn't
be. They are welcome in halls of dazzling delight
in Belgravia and Mayfair, and are asked to meet
all sorts of august personages.  Very right and
proper. A king picked up an artist's pencil, and for
centuries our principal portrait painters have received
the honour of knighthood.</p>
  <p>The old affectation (for it was nothing more) of
preferring clay pipes and beer to cigars and wine,
has passed away. Long hair is nowadays scarcely a

<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>




sign of genius, and a tail coat does not bar the road
to distinction. In a word, artists and journalists have
rejoined the company that ages ago included
Sheridan and Reynolds, Goldsmith and Dr. Johnson.</p></div2>


              <div2 n="ART AND COMMERCE" type="subchapter" id="s162"><head>ART AND COMMERCE.</head>

  <p>Leaving social questions out of consideration, and
merely regarding Art as a profession, there is no
doubt that when successfully followed it is most
lucrative. When certain wills come to be proved I
fancy that it will be discovered that painters make
quite as much money as popular physicians and
celebrated solicitors. The pick of the work (from a
commercial point of view) is portrait painting. I
have been told that every Royal Academician can
secure as much as he pleases of this kind of work if
he likes to accept it. Of course, men of the standing
of Mr. Sargent, Mr. Luke Fildes, and Professor
Herkomer must be pestered with people wishing to
give them commissions. That goes without saying;
but I fancy all the Brethren of Burlington House
could turn portrait painters if they pleased. I believe
that there a number of <q>subjects</q> who give commissions on the understanding that their portraits
must be exhibited either at the Royal Academy or
in the New Gallery. This body (a large one) would
serve as a <foreign lang="FR">clientele</foreign>. However, be it said in honour

<pb id="p.243" n="243"/>




of art that the R.As. are reticent in painting portraits.
Those who practise or have practised this branch of
their profession have invariably been worthy of their
tasks. Some of the best pictures of the century have
been portraits painted by Millais, Fildes, Ouless,
Herkomer, and Frith. After portraits, perhaps
Scriptural subjects are the most lucrative. A
painting that can be shown in a separate room,
and then engraved, is <q>a little fortune</q> to anyone
who can acquire it. <q> Pot-boilers</q> of pretty children,
military exploits, and <q>made-up</q> reproductions of
popular resorts are not to be despised. They all
bring grist to the mill, and in considerable quantities.
The printsellers are great allies of the artists, and so
are the advertisers. Soap-sellers have immortalised
<q>Cherry Ripe</q> and the cigarette makers have
caused many a clever sketch by a worker in black
and white to be continually perpetuated on the
metropolitan hoardings.</p></div2>


              <div2 n="PAST AND PRESENT" type="subchapter" id="s163"><head>PAST AND PRESENT.</head>

  <p>To sum up. The profession of an artist in
London, instead of being considered as the
<q>occupation</q> of an idle dreamer, is now regarded
as an excellent opening for a young man who
can boast talent as well as birth and breeding.
A successful artist must be a well-read and polished

<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>


gentleman. Of course, like <persName key="Tennyson,Alfred">Tennyson</persName>, he may shun
society, but when face to face with his fellows he
must be able to hold his own. Of course I do not
say that genius may not raise an artist from the
ranks as it raises men in every other walk of life
from the same source. The stories of the Chancellors have told us that many a keeper of a sovereign's
conscience has had forbears of the humblest origin.
But such exceptions have proved the rule that in
intellectual callings early associations with refinement
are of the last importance. Nowadays family portraits intended to continue the series of centuries are
painted by the artistic scions of the race depicted,
and even millionaires find no fault with the occupation regarded from the standpoint of L. s. d. So
given talent, there can be no pleasanter career for a
man than that which makes a studio not only a place
of recreation but a source of income.</p></div2>

     <div2 n="SPENDING BANK HOLIDAY IN LONDON." type="subchapter" id="s164"><head>SPENDING BANK HOLIDAY IN LONDON.</head>

<p>ON the first Monday in August all Londoners enjoy,
officially, the last summer outing for the year. If
the weather be fine, thousands and thousands go
rushing into the country on pleasure bent. The rail
and the boat carry them  miles and miles away.
Before the day is over an immense number of our
fellow countrymen are able to boast that they have
been to France and back. A glance at the advertisement columns of the weekly papers on or about this
time will show how many and varied are the distractions
of <q>long distances in limited times.</q> North
and south, east and west, people can go to see their
friends or to renew acquaintance with that universal
benefactress, Dame Nature, in her country residence.
My accomplished friend, Mr. Ashby Sterry, has shown
us in his <q>Tiny Travels</q> how many delightful
excursions may be made near poor old London.

<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>



Town to most Englishmen (and in the term I include Scots, Irish, and Welsh) is at all times a charming spot. I use the adjective advisedly. There is
something absolutely <q>charming</q> about
the accessories of London. A native is accustomed to the
magic of the two great cities, and expresses no
surprise. But the country cousin (who frequently
knows his London infinitely better than his metropolitan relative) finds genuine subjects for wonderment in such places as the Tower, the Crystal Palace,
the National Gallery, the group of Government
exhibitions in South Kensington, and the British
Museum. So, in spite of the rival attractions of the
provinces, I contend that our little village has many
claims upon our attention. London is not half a
bad place to recreate in, but (to quote a song already
old) <q> You have to know it first.</q> Even on a Bank
Holiday life can be lived profitably in town.</p></div2>


  <div2 n="BILLINGSGATE IN THE EARLY MORNING" type="subchapter" id="s165"> <head>BILLINGSGATE IN THE EARLY MORNING.</head>

   <p>I need scarcely say that it is a very excellent
thing, if you can manage it, to rise early. The late
George Augustus Sala has, I think, shown us, in
<q>Twice Round the Clock,</q> that the initial hours of
the day may be spent to great advantage in either
Billingsgate or <placeName key="Covent Garden Market">Covent Garden Market</placeName> . It is some
years since I visited the first place at the time to

<pb id="p.247" n="247"/>




which I have referred, but my recollections of the
occasion are distinctly vivid. I was going by the
early morning boat to Boulogne, and at that time
there was a regulation in force that passengers were
only permitted to come on board an hour before the
departure of the vessel. In these circumstances, I
found myself a person with little to do, plus ample
time in which to do it; or, as our American cousins
might have termed me, a temporary member of the
<q> leisure classes.</q> After leaving St. Katharine's Dock
at about two in the morning I walked by the Tower
Ditch, where I found a man engaged in a fight with
a lady who described herself (in language more suitable, perhaps, to Billingsgate than <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>) as his
wife. As the female was getting the worst of it I
thought it my duty to interfere, when the couple,
recognising the unity imposed upon them by the
law, made up their difference immediately and <q>went
for me.</q> I had to run, if not for my life, at any
rate for my personal safety. I was younger then than
I am now, and therefore could trust to my agility.
I was taught the lesson, however, to avoid interference
in domestic squabbles. It is dangerous to intervene
between man and wife-especially in the neighbourhood of the Tower before sunrise. My rapid retreat
took me to Billingsgate Market, brilliantly lighted
with gas, and full to overflowing with fish salesmen
and fish purchasers. The auctioneers are hard at

<pb id="p.248" n="248"/>



work knocking down the inhabitants of the vasty
deep with the celerity of lightning.  Outside the
market for two or three hundred yards the streets
were congested with carts. Some years after the
date I have in my mind as I write, there was a
correspondence in the newspapers calling attention to
the crush, and declaring that some of the vehicles
crowded with fish never reached their destination.
A number of the correspondents insisted upon the
cruel waste caused by the confusion and interruption
of the traffic, and there were leaders of the usual
type suggesting that London was sacrificed to mismanagement and greed of gain. It was during the
<q> dead season</q> that these interesting communications
appeared, and for the moment everyone left in town
talked of nothing else. Then someone committed
a mysterious murder, or one of our agents in savage
lands got up a little war, or a bank came to grief, or
something of that sort happened, and Billingsgate and
its abuses were forgotten. I have no doubt that were
enquiry made it would be found that Billingsgate
stands where it stood and the abuses are just as
much a matter of the present as they were of the past.
No doubt we pay now just as much (and unjustly too
much) as we did then. A holiday-maker tied to
town on the next <foreign lang="FR">fete</foreign> of St. Lubbock might pay
the place an early morning visit and see how things
are going. Always supposing that the feast does

<pb id="p.249" n="249"/>




not interfere with business, I imagine he would find
plenty of material for an indignant letter to the
papers. Let me recommend the experiment.</p></div2>


  <div2 n="A LITTLE DINNER AT THE SHERIDAN CLUB" type="subchapter" id="s166"><head>A LITTLE DINNER AT THE SHERIDAN CLUB.</head>

  <p>The early riser can get some amusement out of
<placeName key="Covent Garden Market">Covent Garden Market</placeName> shortly after sunrise, as a rule.
But this rule, again, may have its exception-on a
Bank Holiday. Not very long ago I was dining at
a club in the neighbourhood noted for the sociable
qualities of its members. The dinner was held in
the strangers' coffee-room, which, after a certain
hour, becomes the supper-room.  I had a most
delightful time of it until 1.30 o'clock, enjoying
thoroughly the pleasant conversation of the diners.
At that hour the supper-eaters began to appear, and
at 2 o'clock we were earnestly discussing the latest
play. At 3 o'clock there were fresh arrivals, when
one of the number began to explain how a gentleman at the Royal Westminster Aquarium contrived
to jump into a shallow tank from above (and through)
the roof of that popular institution without killing
himself.</p>
  <p><q> If I had to do it,</q> said a portly gentleman, whose
diving days I should have imagined were (if I may
use the expression) more than over, <q> I should arrange
under the water a combination of springs.</q></p>

<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>


  <p><q>Springs of water?</q> asked a wag.    <q>Do you
mean springs of water? </q></p>
  <p><q>No, sir,</q> replied the portly gentleman. <q type="spoken">I do
not mean springs of water, I mean mechanical springs.
It seems to me simple enough.</q></p>
  <p>As no one appeared to wish to discuss the matter
further, it was allowed to drop. Then we talked of
the latest Pinero play until 4 a.m. The conversation
was delightful; still, as the hour of breakfast
approached, I confess I began to think about retiring
to rest. But it is a little difficult to break up a
pleasant <foreign lang="LA">coterie</foreign>, even at daybreak.  It seems so
selfish and unsociable.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">And now how about the Transvaal?</q> asked one
of our party, as the hands of the clock pointed to
5 a.m.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">You must permit me to say,</q> I interposed, <q type="spoken">that I
object to politics.</q></p>
  <p>I rose to go, and my example was followed by the
rest of the company. By this means I was able to
see <placeName key="Covent Garden Market">Covent Garden Market</placeName> in the early hours of the
morning. Of course, if you please, you can retire to
your couch at 10 o'clock overnight, and can be called
by the sweep when he comes to clean the kitchen
chimney. But perhaps a little dinner at the Sheridan
Club is better.</p>
  <p>And when you have seen the great show of flowers
and vegetables I am not sure that you will be much

<pb id="p.251" n="251"/>





the happier or much the wiser. You will come to the
conclusion that Billingsgate <q>by any other name
would smell as sweet </q>-even if it were called Covent
Garden, and that there were worse nicknames in the
world than <q>Mud Salad Market.</q></p></div2>

         <div2 n="A DRIVE IN A DESERTED CITY" type="subchapter" id="s167"><head>A DRIVE IN A DESERTED CITY.</head>

  <p>Suppose, then, that you by some means or other
are up early. Now comes the question how to spend
the day. If it is fine, why not patronise the top of
an omnibus, and from any point of the compass
patronise the City? The streets of London east of
the Griffin at Temple Bar on a Sunday or Bank
Holiday are a sight to see. You can quite understand
why the merchants, bankers, and stockbrokers who
have offices within sound of Bow Bells insist upon a
special week-day house-to-house visitation on the
occasion of a census.  When business is over the
City of London is practically a city of the dead. You
pass through the wide thoroughfares and do not meet
a living soul. The place might be plague-stricken, it
has such a deserted appearance. But <q>in revenge </q>
(as the French say), you see all the beauties of the
spot. Now that road and pavement are not overcrowded with hurrying clerks and crawling vehicles,
you have the chance of inspecting the magnificent new
buildings that during the last few years have sprung

<pb id="p.252" n="252"/>



up on every side with all their glorious luxuriance of
detail. If your taste lie in the direction, you can
enter the City churches. You will find any number
of interesting inscriptions pointing at a score of eventful lives lived in the later centuries.  Here and
there you will come across an ancient tomb, but not
many, for the Great Fire made a general clearance of
the memorials of our ancestors. And if you want to
refresh your memory about City benefactions, go to
the Guildhall Library and Museum. If you desire
to be awed, enter St. Bartholomew's and St. Paul's.
If you have the least intelligence, you will then find
that you have had a delightful morning-always supposing it has been fine.</p></div2>


         <div2 n="A PAUSE FOR REFRESHMENT" type="subchapter" id="s168"><head>A PAUSE FOR REFRESHMENT.</head>

  <p>By the time you have left the City and returned
westward you will learn that you are ready for lunch.
Do not go to your club, but try a restaurant. Without laying myself open to giving a gratuitous advertisement, it may be permissible to hint that there are
two or three establishments in Regent Street where
you can get an excellent meal at a very reasonable
rate-not the regulation English food, cooked in the
customary brutal British fashion, but a dainty meal
worthy of the Olympian gods-a <foreign lang="FR">Chateaubriand</foreign> or a
<foreign lang="FR">filet</foreign>, a <foreign lang="LA">sole Normande</foreign>, or a <foreign lang="FR">turbot au gratin</foreign> with a

<pb id="p.253" n="253"/>




dish of <foreign lang="FR">petits pois au beurre</foreign>, and an <foreign lang="FR">artichaut a l'huile</foreign>.
In the Strand, too, there are a number of excellent
restaurants; but the best of the establishments, take
them all in all, are situated in the Quadrant in
Regent Street. Many's the time have I lunched there,
and, in the days of long ago, dined in its upper chambers, in the company of gallant yeomen, brave aquatic
athletes and equally pleasing companions.  Much
good music, too, have I heard within its welcome
walls. I may not mention its name, but those who
know it will corroborate me in the estimates I have
formed of its value. May it flourish!

        <div2 n="SEEING THE (USUALLY) UNSEEN" type="subchapter" id="s169"><head> SEEING THE (USUALLY) UNSEEN.</head>

  <p>Lunch over, and be ready for a visit to little known
exhibitions and museums. I give a list, and would
like to bet that not a tenth of my readers have been
to one of them, and not a hundredth to all of them.</p>

  <div3 n="DIPLOMA GALLERY, BURLINGTON HOUSE" type="section"><head>DIPLOMA GALLERY, BURLINGTON HOUSE.</head>

  <p>-Next door to the Royal Academy. Open daily all the year
round. Immensely amusing. All the pictures painted
as gifts to the Academy by recently-elected Academicians and Associates. Some of them will make you
roar with laughter. Pictures by several living artists
intensely funny.  In the near neighbourhood the
Gibson collection. A few good Reynoldses and other
British old masters. Altogether the visit will furnish


<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>

<q>instruction combined with amusement,</q> to quote the
phrase associated with the lectures delivered at the
poor old Polytechnic.</p></div3>

	<div3 n="SIR JOHN SLOANE'S MUSEUM" type="section"><p><hi rend="caps">SIR JOHN SLOANE'S MUSEUM</hi>, 13, Lincoln's Inn
Fields.-Any number of original Hogarths, worth
untold gold, and some splendid old Masters.  Lots of
curious odds and ends, inclusive of designs for the
National Gallery, with its salt dredger cupola and its
pepper-box towers.  Gaining admission will be rather
funny.  The public are not allowed to enter on any
Monday, but you can get cards of admission for that
day at the museum from the curator.  So, <q>happy
thought,</q> wake up the curator!</p></div3>

	<div3 n="PARKES' MUSEUM OF THE SANITARY INSTITUTE" type="section"><p><hi rend="caps">PARKES' MUSEUM OF THE SANITARY INSTITUTE,</hi>
74a, Margaret Street, W.-I daresay a most excellent

attractions.  After giving the name and address, it
adds, with significant brevity, <q>Curator, Francis Ford.</q>
The excellent almanack says nothing about the terms
of admission, or gives any further information, so
intending Bank Holiday visitors had better look up

<pb id="p.255" n="255"/>

the curator.  No doubt that presumably excellent
gentleman will be delighted to see them.  If after this
suggestion a discovery is made of what on earth is
to be seen in the Royal Architectural Museum in
18, Tufton Street, S.W., this chapter will not have
been written in vain.</p>
	<p>When these <q>monuments</q> have been done
thoroughly the August reveller might-if he can find
the time-look in at the <orgName key="Royal United Service Institution">Royal United Service Institution</orgName>

interest.</p></div3>

<div2 n="A LITTLE DINNER, AN HOUR'S RECREATION, AND SO TO BED" type="subchapter" id="s170"><head>A LITTLE DINNER, AN HOUR'S RECREATION, AND
SO TO BED</head>

	<p>By this time lunch will have been forgotten, and
it will be approaching the hour of dinner.  Again
discard your club and trust to auxiliary aid.  You
can get an excellent meal at the Hotel Metropole at
a reasonable rate; so you can at the Grand, or the
Victoria.  You can dine comfortably at the Cecil or
the Bristol, and there are millions of worse things than
a dinner at the Holburn Restaurant, or at Frascati's,
in Oxford Street.  If you like Italian dishes, go to



<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>

Privatelli's and Romano's, and if you love fish, visit
Rule's, in Maiden Lane. If you are fond of a quiet
little dinner, try the establishment in Great Portland
Street that Signor Pellegrini (of <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>) knew
so well. Or you might look in at Vevey's. There
is also such a hostelrie as the Continental, and the
Carlton, Long's, and the Hummums have all capital
<foreign lang="FR">tables d'hote</foreign>. When one comes to think of it, there
are so many good feeding places in London that the
question is what to give up and what to retain-not
where to dine, but where not to dine. And having
had dinner and spent an hour at the Palace Theatre
afterwards the Londoner tied to town during the
Bank Holiday may contentedly go to bed.</p></div2>

    <div2 n="A BANK HOLIDAY WITHOUT 'ARRY." type="subchapter" id="s171"><head> A BANK HOLIDAY WITHOUT <q>'ARRY.</q></head>

<p>WHEN one of the statutory Bank Holidays of the
year comes round, all the <foreign lang="FR">employes</foreign> of the <q>money
garneries</q> take full advantage of their legalised
leisure. But not only these gentlemen are at
liberty, but the thousands, and I may almost say
millions of people whose occupation goes with the
compulsory closing of the pass-books. All the shops
have their shutters up, and were it not that all the
churches remain closed, while all the public-houses
are open, it would be difficult to distinguish Monday
from Sunday. Sir John Lubbock when he obtained
his beatification by acclamation, no doubt little anticipated the wide extension of his plan of recreation.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to learn whether the philanthropic baronet expected the closing of the banks
to be followed by the suspension of business on the
part of the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick-maker.

<pb id="p.258" n="258"/>



No doubt, when his Bill became an Act, Sir
John had in his mind's eye the relief of that highly
respectable individual, the <q>paying-in-clerk.</q> It
would be difficult to imagine a more staid person
than this calm official. Until lately there was a law
in one of the great banking establishments that no
<foreign lang="FR">employe</foreign> of the firm should be permitted to wear
moustaches, and it is not easy to imagine a bank
clerk of any standing wearing knickerbockers and a
pot-hat. No doubt Sir John imagined that the
released toilers of the four statutory holidays would
be of the highly respectable type I have suggested.
As a matter of fact-as all the world knows-the
Bank Holiday has been given over in great part to
that most objectionable individual, the ubiquitous
and unextinguishable <soCalled>'Arry.</soCalled> And the presence of
this person renders the enjoyment of a Bank Holiday
almost impossible to ordinary Londoners. And this
being so, it may not be out of place to consider the
means of making the most of the festival <foreign lang="LA">minus</foreign>
'Arry.	</p></div2>

         <div2 n="THE SURVIVAL OF THE SNOB" type="subchapter" id="s172"><head>THE SURVIVAL OF THE SNOB.</head>

  <p>And now before considering how a holiday may
be enjoyed without the company of the ubiquitous
one, it may be as well to examine 'Arry as he lives
at the end of the nineteenth century.  He is not
altogether a modern creature, in spite of the portrait

<pb id="p.259" n="259"/>




that has been painted of him by Mr. <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>. <q>The
Sage of <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName></q> (to give the licensed jester of
the Press one of his favourite titles) has drawn him as
a slangy, pretentious fellow, well up in the politics of
the day, and, in fact, a person of considerable
general information. It is interesting to note that
'Arry is the survival of the snob that Albert Smith
imagined in the pages of <hi rend="italics">The London Charivari</hi> long
before <persName key="Thackeray, William Makepeace">Thackeray</persName> had seized upon the term and
completely altered its significance. The snob of the
early forties was a quieter specimen of the genus cad
than his descendant 'Arry. He was given to wearing
<q> loud </q> costumes, but was dignified rather than noisy.
His one idea was to copy his betters, and as the swell
of the period was celebrated for his gravity, the snob
was sedate, not to say solemn. In the hands of the
explorer of Mont Blanc the little Cockney became
quite a creation. He was, so to speak, too large for
<hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>, and expanded into the pages of a supplementary publication. If I am not mistaken, the snob
was the subject of one of those sixpenny books that
Albert Smith brought out shortly after seceding from
the company of 85, <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, or rather Wellington
Street, Strand. Perhaps my friend Mr. Ashby
Sterry, who is a great authority upon these remarkable little works, will say his say upon the subject.
Did the author of <q> The Adventures of Mr. Ledbury </q>
ever write of <q>the snob?</q>  That is the question I

<pb id="p.260" n="260"/>




put to the erudite author of <q>The Bystander.</q>
Whether he did or not does not alter the fact that
the snob of the forties was the 'Arry of the nineties
-with a difference. That difference may be aptly
termed a time allowance. Things change and with
them 'Arrys.</p></div2>

          <div2 n="HOW TO AVOID THE PEST" type="subchapter" id="s173"><head>HOW TO AVOID THE PEST.</head>

  <p>It would be a mistake to regard all Bank Holiday
makers as specimens of Mr. <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>'s well-known
type. As a rule the <q>h</q> less stumpy lad of the
<placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> creation is not to be found in excursions
where the British artisan is much in evidence. He is
not particularly fond of the railway, and unless a
local is seldom seen at the sea-side. He appears to
thrive in the London air, and is never so happy as
when treading his native pavements. Occasionally
he takes a trip on board some river steamboat to
Margate, and more recently Boulogne-sur-Mer; but
for choice he patronises <q>'Ampstead 'Eath</q> or
<soCalled>'Appy 'Ampton.</soCalled> He is never so much at ease as
when he is shouting or singing <q> Down 'Endon Way,</q>
or doing the forest glades of Easterly Chingford.
He may be found at the music halls and the <foreign lang="FR">al fresco</foreign>
exhibitions. He does not care much for the drama,
and even at <q>the temples of varieties </q> prefers the
blandishments of the young lady at the bar to the
vocal charms of the most fascinating of <q>serio


<pb id="p.261" n="261"/>



comiques.</q> Of one thing Bank Holiday travellers
may be tolerably certain. That nowadays the many
excellent excursions organised by the various railway
companies will be free from the intrusion of this
personal pest. 'Arry has no friends nor relatives out
of London. He is not troubled to go to the north,
south, east, or west in search of kith and kin. So
those who intend to travel to their country places
need have no fear of molestation from <q>the loud
brigade.</q> The excursionists of to-day may in some
instances be sufficiently homely folk, but they will
be kindly and obliging, and in every sense the
antithesis of 'Arry. So all the Bank Holiday maker
has to do is to avoid the suburbs. To be extra particular, places whose names are initialled with an
aspirate should be barred. As a matter of fact,
towns commencing with an <q> H </q> have a fascination
for 'Arry. Although not loving the sea, he is still
occasionally found at <q>'Astings</q> and <q>'Erne Bay.</q></p>
</div2>

         <div2 n="'ARRY AND THE THEATRE" type="subchapter" id="s174"><head> 'ARRY AND THE THEATRE.</head>

  <p>Strange to say, so far, <q>'Arry</q> has avoided the
stage, or rather, has proved unattractive to the
dramatists. On a first night he is occasionally found
in the front rows of the pit, and joins heartily in the
guffaws which follow a successful attempt to <q> guy</q>
some novel production. I do not think he has the

<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>



wit to invent those satirical remarks that now and
again serve as an accompaniment to the dialogue of
a play <q>going badly,</q> but he can always take part
in the merriment with which those comical conceits
are greeted. But, as a character on the boards, he is
distinctly a novelty. Mr. Weedon Grossmith gave
a very amusing sketch of a Jewish 'Arry in one of
Mr. Pinero's clever farces, and Mr. Penley has also
approached within measurable distance of the great
original in another play. But 'Arry <foreign lang="FR">pur et simple</foreign>
(or rather neither) has yet to be introduced to the
patrons of the playhouse. We have had something
very like 'Arriet in various types of female unloveliness, but 'Arry has yet to be painted. It is a pity
that Ibsen knows so little of England. Many of
the characters in his extraordinary plays are not
altogether unsuggestive of the typical Cockney cad.
Of course, the Master Builder is altogether a superior
person, and yet in his selfishness and conceit, his
treatment of his wife, his type-writer, and apprentice
there is some resemblance in his character to the
London pest. Not that 'Arry would have ascended
a steeple with a view to waving a flag. 'Arry, to put
it in his own favourite <q>lingo,</q> would have <q>known
a trick worth two of that.</q> Besides, Ibsen's Master
Builder was a man almost past the prime of life. No
doubt he was more accustomed to slippers,
dressing-gowns, and spectacles than steeple-climbing. The

<pb id="p.263" n="263"/>



Master Builder was a rather melancholy gentleman
of about fifty-five or sixty. 'Arry never grows a
day older than twenty-five or thirty. When he
marries-which he does fairly early-he ceases to
be himself, and becomes unobjectionable. Whether
he marries 'Arriet I know not, but if he does, both he
and she cease to be nuisances and <q> tone down </q> into
something quite presentable. So 'Arryism may be
regarded as the attribute of youth if not of beauty.</p></div2>


              <div2 n="A CLUB FOR 'ARRY" type="subchapter" id="s175"><head>A CLUB FOR 'ARRY.</head>

  <p>Still, 'Arry does exist, and is unfortunately <foreign lang="FR">en
evidence</foreign> on a Bank Holiday. He is particularly
fond of the river, and, if the weather be fairly good,
will be found in hundreds and thousands on the
Thames. He is rather amusing-from a distance.
At Kingston there is a charming club on the banks
of the Thames, with pleasant grounds and a
well-appointed house. Before now I have, on a Bank
Holiday, journeyed down to this favourite spot, and
from the terrace have watched 'Arry at my leisure.
I have been amused at his high spirits as displayed
in <q> larks </q> on a boat, and have even appreciated his
indistinctly heard harmony. 'Arry is better far
away; in his case distance certainly lends enchantment
to the view. The club to which I refer is
within half-an-hour of town. You can train it or cab

<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>



it or coach it. Arrived at your happy retreat, you
can lunch for a florin or dine at three-and-sixpence.
The wine is good and cheap, and altogether the place
is worthy of patronage. On Bank Holidays it is
simply delightful. There are very few members
present, so that you can easily escape <q> the madding
crowd.</q> And here I may express my surprise that so
far 'Arry has been clubless. Why does he not start
a joint-stock palace on the lines set down in <placeName key="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</placeName>? It would be a good thing, for 'Arry, once
subject to committee rules, would readily abandon
his most objectionable attributes. Just now new
clubs are rather at a discount, otherwise my suggestion might be valuable. It will be necessary to find
a good name for the <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign>. How about <q>The
Imperial </q>? 'Arry is nothing if not patriotic.</p></div2>


   <div2 n="A SUBSTITUTE FOR A DAY WITH 'ARRY" type="subchapter" id="s176"><head> A SUBSTITUTE FOR A DAY WITH 'ARRY.</head>

  <p>In considering the Cockney as a class I have
almost forgotten to suggest a mode of avoiding him
as an individual. I have hinted that clubland is forbidden ground (at present) to the successor of
Smith's snob. But there are other places that are
equally sacred. 'Arry avoids a <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> because he is
refused admittance; he does not appear at any of
the museums because he has no inclination. The
young man is nothing if not light-hearted. He likes

<pb id="p.265" n="265"/>



the open air, where there is plenty of room for his
pipe, his stick, and his laugh. So if you want to
avoid him on a Bank Holiday you cannot do better
than visit the South Kensington Museum, or the
National Gallery, or St. Paul's, or <placeName key="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName>
. Now that 'Arry can no longer inscribe his
initials on the tombs of kings, or the funeral cars of
emperors, he cares not for cathedrals. Now that he
is expected to be silent in a public library, he no
longer haunts the great reading-room of Bloomsbury.
It is quite safe to go to any place of instruction open
gratuitously to the public. The young man will not
be found at the Diploma Gallery, nor the School of
Mines in Jermyn Street, nor even at the Sir Hans
Sloane's Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields, so the
general public may go to those haunts of the learned
in their thousands. If they do, they will no doubt
rather surprise the custodians, inured, as they must
be, to solitude in its simplest form; but that is a
matter of detail. As for the typical Cockney, he can
go where he will, and no doubt will take full advantage of the privilege. A day devoted to the Diploma
Gallery is not suggestive of the wildest delight, but
it is better than 'Ampstead and 'Arry. At least, such
is the opinion of those who have tried both, and have
no desire to retry either.</p></div2>

<p>No work on London would be complete without some

  <p>I am not sure that a book devoted exclusively to
the careful consideration of the comfort of travellers
would not be a success. It may be that such a volume
exists. I have certainly one in my mind that appeared some five and twenty years ago (when I had
scarcely parted company with my teens), and which
no doubt is even now obtainable. I refer to <q> Tracts
for Tourists,</q> by my old and valued friend, Mr. F. C.

<pb id="p.267" n="267"/>




Burnand. In this excellent <hi rend="italics">brochure</hi> (which, by the
way, was originally illustrated by the late Charles
Keene), the author showed how voyaging in peace
and quietness could be accomplished. In an early
chapter a list of necessaries was given. The traveller
was recommended never to leave London without
putting some panes of glass in his portmanteau, so
that in the event of finding a broken window he
might have the wherewithal to mend it! From this
it will be seen that Mr. Burnand had thoughtfully
considered even the remotest contingencies. It is
scarcely necessary to add after this reference to its
contents that <q> Tracts for Tourists,</q> before republication
in volume form, originally appeared in the pages
of <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>. The author had only recently joined <q> the
table</q> under the genial editorship of the late Mark
Lemon. In those distant days he had for colleagues
<persName key="Thackeray, William Makepeace">Thackeray</persName>, Shirley Brooks, Tom Taylor, Percival
Leigh, Charles Keene, W. C. Bennett, George Du
Maurier, and John Tenniel. Of all the cheery company
only one remains-the last-named. The original
editor and his couple of successors have passed away,
and Mr. Burnand occupies the chair. He has one
comrade, <q> good Sir John,</q> the Emperor of cartoonists.
<q>Tracts for Tourists,</q> in spite of the light strain in
which it is written, contains many a useful hint.</p></div2>

                 <div2 n="ON THE ROAD" type="subchapter" id="s179"><head>ON THE ROAD.</head>

  <p>I have mentioned <persName key="Thackeray, William Makepeace">Thackeray</persName>, and the name conjures
up visions of family coaches and postboys.
When the greatest novelist of the century wrote his
<q>Irish Sketch Book</q> his <q> From Cornhill to Cairo,</q>
and his <q>Kickleburys on the Rhine,</q> the thing to
do was to take your landau with you and to trust to
posting horses for traction. Of course, in these days
of railways, when a diligence is almost a curiosity, the
old-fashioned mode of progression to which I refer is
obsolete. Still, there are worse <q> ways of going </q> than
coming to town in your own carriage. Some little
while since I was driven from <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> to town in a
landau. The journey took a couple of days, as we
preferred to take it easily. We stopped for the night
at Canterbury. We got over some twenty or thirty
miles in the early morning, and gave the horses a rest
for what remained of the twenty-four hours. This
was a good arrangement for bipeds and quadrupeds.
The first had plenty of time for <q> doing</q> the adjacent
country, and the last kept in good condition and
enjoyed the trip as much as their owners. It was
necessary to choose the main road as some of the country
lanes were too narrow to admit of the passage of so
large an order as a landau and pair. But granted
this, and the choice of a route was unlimited.</p>

<pb id="p.269" n="269"/>




  <p>Another excellent mode of travelling by road is on
the saddle of a bicycle or tricycle. Nowadays there
is scarcely a country inn that does not belong to the
great wheel union, otherwise the Cycling Tourist
Club. <q>They will do you well</q> wherever you go;
and here is a tip.  If you do not want to be
cumbered with the small but necessary kit, why not
send it beforehand by parcel post? At the cost of
a few pence you could despatch your handbag from
station to station. No doubt this hint will not be
thrown away upon the knights of the road. This is
a distinct improvement upon the custom of the man
who walked himself and carried his umbrella in a
following hansom.</p></div2>


   <div2 n="THE CHOICE OF A TRAVELLING COMPANION" type="subchapter" id="s180"><head>THE CHOICE OF A TRAVELLING COMPANION.</head>

   <p>Perhaps the success of the cycle has made walking
tours completely out of date. A few years ago it
was no uncommon thing for two friends to decide
upon <q>tripping it on foot.</q>  Nowadays they will
arrange to <q>cruise upon wheels.</q> And here a very
important element in travelling and comfort comes in.
The choice of a companion is a matter of vital importance.
Of course, if you are married you can have
no possible pleasanter traveller than your better
seven-eighths. This is manifest for many reasons-perhaps
the principal being that any other choice would be

<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>



contested by the important fraction referred to. But
say that you are a bachelor, and, consequently, fancy
free, why, then you have to choose a friend. And here
I suggest an <foreign lang="FR">a propos</foreign> conundrum. When is a friend
not a friend? When he is a fellow traveller. This
is, in five cases out of six, the correct answer. There
is nothing so trying to friendship as the hardships of
a tour. In my time, I have made many a trip with
an intimate friend, and it is my pride and my pleasure
to know that he and I are still, in spite of this
companionship, on terms of intimate friendship. But that
our relations are so satisfactory, is, I believe, entirely
due to my tact and good humour. <foreign lang="FR">En voyage</foreign>, I make
tact and good humour the <foreign lang="FR">specialites de la maison</foreign>.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">We will go to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>,</q> my friend used to say, <q type="spoken">by Dieppe. Capital route, see Rouen, and get to a station close to the Boulevards. Cheap too.</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Certainly,</q> I would reply, hating the sea like
poison, and fearful of that possibly dreadful passage
from Newhaven.</p>
  <p>A few hours later I would get a telegram, saying
that my friend had decided that we should go via
<placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> and <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName>. I would joyfully respond, <q type="spoken">Why,
certainly.</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">We will put up at Meurice's,</q> my fellow traveller
would suggest when we had got to Amiens.</p>
<p><q type="spoken">Old-fashioned house, capital food, and I like the Rue de
Rivoli better than the Boulevards.</q>
</p>


<pb id="p.271" n="271"/>




  <p><q type="spoken"> Quite so,</q> I would respond meekly.</p>
 <p> Then when we arrived at the terminus I would find
that our luggage had been deposited in one of the
omnibuses belonging to the Grand Hotel.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">You see I think after all it is better than Meurice's,</q>
  my friend would explain; <q type="spoken">it is nearer the
theatres, you know, and the <foreign lang="FR">table d'hote</foreign> breakfast is
excellent.</q></p>
  <p>I used to acquiesce. Then my companion would
draw up a route. We were to go to Bale, Lausanne,
Berne, Interlaken, Lucerne, and come back express
from Geneva. I would be delighted. However, in
spite of the expression of satisfaction I was not in the
least surprised when, at the end of our trip, I found
that we had avoided Switzerland, and had travelled
exclusively on the Rhine and in Holland.</p>
  <p>The golden rule for getting on with a travelling
companion is to submit your will to his. Let him
have his own way. There cannot be two people
<q>personally conducting a tour,</q> so retire in his favour.</p>
  <p>Nowadays it is rather fashionable to be poor, so
there is no disgrace in travelling <q>third</q> in preference
to <q>first.</q>  I fancy that the French have a
proverb that the <foreign lang="FR">premiere classe</foreign> is only patronised
by millionaires, English, and fools. That occasionally
it is necessary to take the highest-priced ticket goes
without saying. For instance, the administration at
times have a custom of only having first class carriages

<pb id="p.272" n="272"/>



travelling <foreign lang="FR">grande vitesse</foreign>. If you go second
or third you must be satisfied with <foreign lang="FR">petite vitesse</foreign>. The
second choice is tantamount to doubling, or even
trebling, the time required for the journey. And here,
<foreign lang="FR">a propos de bottes</foreign>, let me say that, if you are going to
cross a mountain pass, don't go by the night diligence,
but take a carriage. If you are going by boat in Italy,
it will be as well to enquire when those boats leave
port, when they arrive at their destination, and if
they carry cargo. One particularly hot autumn I decided
to return from Rome by water. The capital of
Christendom was placarded with posters telling of the
delights of the line of Somebody <foreign lang="FR">freres</foreign>. I determined
to patronise the firm. I went on board at
Civita Vecchia at 12 noon, and found that the boats
started at midnight Then when I was imprisoned
on board I discovered that the ship was carrying a
cargo of green figs. A little later I noticed the decks
and berths swarming with worms. I got off at Leghorn.
As I was leaving I noticed that the cargo was
being changed-the good ship was leaving the figs at
Leghorn and taking on board any number of pigs
destined for a midnight cruise to Genoa!</p></div2>


     <div2 n="IS IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A COURIER?" type="subchapter" id="s181"><head>IS IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A COURIER?</head>

  <p>Supposing that money is no consideration, ought
one to take a courier? Personally, I say no; although,


<pb id="p.273" n="273"/>




of course, it is pleasant to have some one to
relieve one of the necessity of paying hotel bills,
looking after luggage, and taking tickets. Beyond this a
courier is practically valueless. In these days of
universal travelling you don't want him as a guide. And
even if you do, you are lucky if he knows more than
your Baedeker or Murray can tell you.</p>
  <p><q>What is that, Karl? </q>you ask.</p>
  <p><q>I think, sare, it is a church,</q> replies your guide,
companion, but scarcely friend.</p>
  <p><q> And that ?</q></p>
  <p><q> It may be a town hall, or perhaps a theatre.</q></p>
  <p>And you have to fall back upon your red books.
On the whole, even with untold gold at your command,
it seems to me that a courier is superfluous.</p></div2>


      <div2 n="A FEW TIPS FOR THE THOUGHTLESS" type="subchapter" id="s182"><head>A FEW TIPS FOR THE THOUGHTLESS.</head>

  <p>If you have gone over the same ground before, it
will be your own fault if you have not made notes in
your diary. I always jot down my impressions of a
hotel <foreign lang="FR">en route</foreign>. I could travel half over Europe and
know where to go and what hotel to avoid. As to
luggage, of course the less you take the better, as
<q>extra weight</q> mounts up terribly the moment you
get quit of the influence exercised by the great
English railway companies. Still, never travel without
your dress clothes, a frock coat, and a hat box.

<pb id="p.274" n="274"/>


<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, Vienna, and Berlin are on a par with London,
and you should be quite as particular in your apparel
in those capitals as you are when you are lounging
in the Park or strolling down Bond Street in the
height of the season. Of course, evening dress is
indispensable. If you do not take it with you, you
may be sure that before your trip is over you will
have urgently required it. Then, again, it is always
as well to carry your passport. You may never be
asked for it, but still to have it about you gives you a
sense of security that nothing else can afford. Finally,
take the advice of my old and valued friend Sir Henry
Thompson and never drink water on the Continent
<foreign lang="FR">pur et simple</foreign>. As a matter of fact, it will not be
<foreign lang="FR">pur et simple</foreign>, but very much the reverse. Take cold
tea in profusion and (the least advertised) aerated
water. Last tip of all. When you have had enough
of the Continent come back to England. You will
then learn that (alas!) there is no place like home.</p></div2>

<p>ABOUT August the arrival platforms at the various
London termini of the railway companies are
crowded with young gentlemen who have come home
to their parents to enjoy from six weeks to a couple
of months' vacation. Those who have returned from
inland schools expect a trip to the seaside, and those
who have just left the sea breezes suggest other
pleasant resorts. The young gentlemen are on their
best behaviour, and if some of their <q>toppers </q> have
served as inadequate substitutes for footballs during
the journey the incident is of no lasting importance.
For the moment the juvenile hopefuls are as <q>good
as gold.</q> For some days they will probably remain
in this pleasant disposition. Then as they grow
accustomed to the clemency of their parents, and
forget the discipline of the Rev. Dr. Birch, they will
become as <q>good as silver.</q> And later still silver

<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>



will be exchanged for copper, and not improbably for
brass. When they arrive at this stage of behaviour
the worst will not be over, but only just begun. I
think we may take it that the holidays will be made
up of a week of gold, three days of silver, forty-eight
hours of copper, and a month and a half of brass.
Under these circumstances, it will be wise to get your
family to the seaside well before gold turns into the
baser metals. If you do not, the chances are that
your most cherished books will be dirty-fingered,
your most valuable carpets stamped out, and your
neighbours for miles round set at open defiance.</p></div2>


   <div2 n="SEASIDE LODGING FOR YOUNG HOPEFUL" type="subchapter" id="s184"><head>SEASIDE LODGING FOR <q>YOUNG HOPEFUL.</q></head>

   <p>Some years ago there was published a <hi rend="italics">brochure</hi>
(I believe of American origin) called <q>Helen's
Babies,</q> in which were described the doings of two
naughty but otherwise pleasant children. And
earlier still-if I am not mistaken, a third of a
century since-the proprietors of <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> gave to the
world an excellent volume, in which John Leech had
drawn and coloured a series of cartoons showing the
chief incidents of <q> Master Jacky's Holidays.</q> As a
father I do not regret that this last work is out of
print. So far as I can remember, the artist had
shown how very bad his hero could be. In one
picture Jacky was seen playing a game of cricket in

<pb id="p.277" n="277"/>



the drawing-room, in another he was discovered
<q>repairing</q> the furniture by hammering superfluous
nails into the backs of the dining-room chairs, in a
third he was practising the performance of a
<q>foot-balancer,</q> with the baby instead of a barrel on the
soles of his boots. Altogether Jacky was having a
better time of it than his parents, and I think I may
add his sisters, his cousins, his uncles, and his aunts.
Nowadays Jacky's sons and even grandsons are
better behaved than their unruly ancestor. Still,
there is something in the principle of heredity, and
consequently it is as well to get to the seaside as
quickly as possible. Having children of my own
(excellent boys-like their father the very pattern of
propriety), I have some little experience of what is
best to be done. It is as well to go down unaccompanied
(save by your excellent better half) to the
seaside place you propose to honour with your
patronage. I have known the most promising lodging lost
by the appearance of Young Hopeful and
his brethren. A  lady of my acquaintance a short
time since had just arranged for apartments on
particularly beneficial terms, when everything was
spoiled by the sudden appearance of her two good
boys.</p>
  <p><q>No, thank you, ma'am,</q> exclaimed the landlady,
a spinster of mature age; <q>I'd rather not let the
lodgings. I don't like children.</q></p>

<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>



  <p><q> But,</q> said the fond mother, <q>these are the best
of boys. Everyone says that they have the faces of
angels.</q></p>
  <p><q>That may be,</q> replied the landlady; <q>but you
don't say what kind of angels! My experience is
that the better they look the worse they are.</q></p>
  <p>And nothing could shake the decision of the
lodging-keeper, and my friend and her boys had to
go elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Another reason why we should look out for apartments
without accompanists is to escape the chance
of infection. Some householders at the seaside have
a very elastic conscience anent the subject of illness.
In the opinion of many who wish to get rid of their
<q> drawing-rooms </q> and their <q>parlour-floors </q> whooping
cough is <q>a slight cold,</q> scarlet fever <q>a harmless
rash,</q> and typhoid merely <q>a bad headache.</q> In
August the lodgings are fairly free from danger, but
in May, June, and the early part of July there is
always a good deal of what I may term <q>floating
illness</q> about. People who have children who have
just recovered from this and that are very fond of
sending them to the East Kent coast to regain complete
recovery. All you can do when you find this
has been done is to charge the landlady with having
infringed the statute. If you are a barrister and can
back up your charge with a little legal knowledge so

<pb id="p.279" n="279"/>




much the better. And after doing this there is
nothing else to be done.</p></div2>


<div2 n="YOUNG PHILANTHROPISTS ON THE COMMON GREEN" type="subchapter" id="s185"><head>YOUNG PHILANTHROPISTS ON THE COMMON GREEN.</head>

  <p>In securing a seaside residence for our youngsters
it is not always advisable to attempt to obtain for
them the questionable advantage of what may be
termed <q>a common green.</q> A recreation ground
<q> open to all residents of Imperial Terrace</q> may be
very pleasant for the seniors, but occasionally the
juniors find their chief amusement in quarrelling with
one another. The occupants of <q>the common
green</q> frequently split into sets. The Browns refuse
to talk to the Joneses, and both boycott the Robinsons.
Then Young Hopeful, if he is of an ingenious
turn of mind, utilises the backs of the houses as a
sort of contributory savings bank. I have heard of
a case where certain young gentlemen of a benevolent
turn of mind appeared as <q> mysterious minstrels,</q>
with blue spectacles, wideawake hats, and mufflers
complete, and set themselves to collect pence for a
charitable object. Provided with a toy banjo and a
miniature tambourine, they regaled the occupants of
the Imperial Terrace with a selection of comic songs
chosen from  the <foreign lang="FR">repertoire</foreign> of the neighbouring
sands. Until their efforts in the cause of philanthropy
were discovered by their parents these young

<pb id="p.280" n="280"/>



disciples of Howard and Wilberforce collected something
like three or four shillings a day. The
collections, I have heard, were devoted to the
encouragement of that languishing branch of trade,
the <q>real Turkish sherbet</q> and miscellaneous sweetstuff
industry. I have been told that these same
boy-benefactors, on the regatta night, having
organised a small display of fireworks on <q>the
common green,</q> proposed to admit the public to the
grounds-a privilege hitherto reserved for the exclusive
use of the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="FR">bona fide</foreign></hi> residents of Imperial
Terrace. However, that the public might not be
overburdened with a sense of unsolicited obligation,
the boys, with a tact considerably in advance of
their years, proposed charging each candidate for
admission the sum of twopence, as a sort of complimentary entrance fee. No doubt the sum realised
by this thoughtful arrangement would have been
expended on the further support of the decayed
industry to which I have already referred. But, as
ill-fortune would have it, the first persons to seek
admission were the parents of the Masters Hopeful.
This would have been a matter of small importance
had a member of the firm been at the gate, but cruel
fate decided that a sympathetic friend should have
been left in charge, who knew not Mr. and Mrs.
Hopeful, senior. This sympathetic friend, being a
little misty in his arithmetic, informed the candidates

<pb id="p.281" n="281"/>




for admission that the charge was <q>twopence each,
or sixpence for the two.</q> An <foreign lang="FR">expose</foreign> followed

         <div2 n="THE DANGERS OF THE SANDS" type="subchapter" id="s186"><head>THE DANGERS OF THE SANDS.</head>

  <p>But if <q>a common green </q> is not always a success,
the sands can scarcely be called a triumph. I mean,
of course, if the sands are sands with the customary
accessories. The children who patronise the golden
strand have the advantage of learning a number of
comic songs better suited for the seaside than the
drawing-room. It is all very well for hoarse-voiced
niggers to describe the advantages or disadvantages
of <q>a pimple on the nose</q> to the presumably indifferent sad sea waves, but such topics of conversation, even when introduced by youngsters of blood
and breeding, are a little out of place in my lady's
boudoir. Further, the perambulating phrenologists
may interfere with a boy's future by suggesting that
as he is witty, rich and virtuous, he should <q>marry a
young lady from a restaurant and open a little public
'ouse, in which he was sure to do well.</q> Such
proposals, if adopted by a lad of an impressionable
disposition, might compromise most seriously a contemplated career in diplomacy, the army, the navy,
or at the forensic (as distinguished from the tavern)
bar. But perhaps the most serious danger of all is

<pb id="p.282" n="282"/>



the off chance of the spread of infection. Some little
while ago I saw two lads quarrelling.</p>
  <p><q> I tell you what,</q> said one to the other, <q> when my
big brother comes down he will give it you. When
he comes you will catch it! </q></p>
  <p><q> Catch what? </q> was the reply, <q>a licking ? </q></p>
  <p><q> No, the whooping cough! </q></p>
  <p>But perhaps, after all, in these days of cabs and
omnibuses you can catch whatever there is to be
caught as easily in London as elsewhere. If the
children are all day long in the open air, and take
advantage of the inviting proximity of the sea, they
should be as fever proof at a watering place as in
town. However, when possible it is as well to keep
on the safe side.</p>
  <p>In your own self-defence it is as well to supply
amusements for the children. If you do not you may
be sure (if they are worth their salt) they will take
the matter into their own hands, to your ultimate
disadvantage.</p>
  <p>Bicycles in moderation are pleasant distraction,
and even fishing (under the guidance of an experienced boatman) is permissible. If you do not
grant these concessions the boys will either hire a
gig and try to drive tandem or perch themselves on
some exceedingly slippery and dangerous rocks in
pursuit of the wily minnow. Meet your children
half way. Strive to be their <q>guides, philosophers,

<pb id="p.283" n="283"/>





and friends.</q> If you are not, you may be sure they
will lead you a pretty dance.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, if the youngsters are a little lively,
it will be only a proof that they are in the vigour of
good health. After all, boys will be boys, for the
reason, presumably, that they cannot possibly be
girls. So long as they are truthful and kind to
animals, and fond of their parents, what more can you
want? If they smash windows, wear out carpets,
and upset expensive china, it is only for three
months in the year. Nay more, even if they celebrate (rather after date) the Diamond Jubilee by
hanging in their bedroom four dozen lighted
Japanese lanterns, what does it matter?  The
chances are they won't burn the house down, and
even if they do, are you not insured? The holidays are soon over, and when they come to a
conclusion you miss your boys, although they may
be <q>pickles.</q> When all is said and done they have
only been following a precedent. It is unnecessary
to go into the matter too strictly, but it may be that
that precedent may have been set by yourself. The
boy is the father of the man, and who can recall the
freaks of childhood? As a rule, it is the naughty
boy who becomes a bishop, and the boy who is
<q> much too good to live</q> who performs that painful
operation known as <q>coming a cropper.</q></p></div2>

<p>ABOUT the time of year when the House is up, the
clubs are closed, and only barristers desirous of
<q> vacation business </q> remain in town, everyone who
can afford the luxury of a trip to the Continent
thinks of <q>Crossing the Channel.</q> To most of us
it is not a very pleasant thought, scarcely (as Mr.
Burnand would say) a <q>happy thought.</q>     But
Englishmen who would set foot upon foreign shores,
must face the difficulty and overcome their repugnance to <foreign lang="FR">mal de mer</foreign>. After all, nowadays, in the
very worst weather, thanks to the magnificent
boats of the South Eastern and Chatham and Dover
Companies, the journey only takes a little over an
hour. I believe the <hi rend="italics">Lord Warden</hi> and the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName>
Douvres</hi>, if put to it, can cover the sea between harbour and harbour, in fifty-five minutes. I
need scarcely say, that this is a vast improvement

<pb id="p.285" n="285"/>


upon the times of long ago, when the <hi rend="italics">Foam</hi> and
her sister ships used to journey slowly and surely
from port to port. I fancy the vessels to which I
refer still exist, and some times appear in the night
time, but the day mail passengers have the advantage
of the pick of the Companies' fleet. And nine times
out of ten the passage is charming-that is to say,
when the equinoctial gales (like the spot stroke) are
barred. But the latter, unfortunately, are of villainous quality and rapidly pull down the average. Still,
crossing the Channel is a solid or rather liquid fact
and cannot be shirked by a Londoner. He must
visit <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, which, according to the Institute of
Journalists, is a part of the London District.</p></div2>


    <div2 n="CONCERNING THE CHANNEL TUNNEL" type="subchapter" id="s188"><head> CONCERNING THE CHANNEL TUNNEL.</head>

  <p>Until patriotism interfered there seemed a chance
of escaping the terrors of the waves by getting from
England to France under sea and under ground.
Some years ago I was honoured with an invitation to
inspect the Channel Tunnel. The prime mover in
the scheme was present, and the party he entertained
were statesmen, soldiers, and journalists. After we
had been carried in a truck some little distance, and
had walked through a hole about five feet four in
height and width a further distance, we came to the
end of the excavation. The boring was being

<pb id="p.286" n="286"/>



carried on with the assistance of compressed air, and
the works were illuminated with what was then a
novelty, the electric light. After we had admired
all that was to be seen we were entertained at
luncheon. Everyone was confident of success, and
the idea of a scare was scouted. Two of our party
were military men, and I was amused to note the
prime mover in the scheme suggesting a plan for the
defence of the mouth of the Tunnel. The warriors
courteously listened, but did not seem convinced.
This visit was paid in the days when the Channel
Tunnel was scarcely <q>contentious business.</q> It
had been approved by Beaconsfield and <persName key="Gladstone, Herbert">Gladstone</persName>,
and the murmurs of the generals were then undeveloped. A story is told of the late <q> Professor</q>
Percival Leigh, that when inviting his friends to eat
some mushrooms set before them he suggested that
although the best medical authorities declared the
fungi in question to be highly poisonous, <q>he did
not think so.</q> In like manner, although most of the
great military experts have declared the Channel
Tunnel would weaken our powers of defence, <q>I
don't think so.</q> And I never feel more confident on
the point than when I am on the seas between <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>
and <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> in tempestuous weather.</p></div2>

and <persName key="Thackeray, William Makepeace">Thackeray</persName>, in one of his <q> Christmas Books,</q>
have described the first primitive attempts at
travelling with the assistance of steam locomotion.
In the forties, a gentleman of means got to the coast
in his chariot, shipped it on board the packet, and
continued his journey when he reached <q>the other
side.</q> Not long ago I came upon an inn in <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>
nestling under the shadow of the Castle, which, from
its sign, must have been close to the departure stage
of the steam packets. I am not sufficiently learned
in the history of <q> one of the most important of our
Cinque Ports</q> to say whether the boat ever started
from that part of the place which is farthest away
from the Lord Warden Hotel. However, there
within a stone's throw of the new pier and the large
<foreign lang="FR">caravanserai</foreign> that is now  the prosperous Hotel
Burlington, was <q>the Mail Packet Inn.</q> To reach
Boulogne from Folkestone, is now an easy matter,
but in the days of the past the favourite route was
from St. Katharine's Docks. When I was a child, I
was constantly going to Boulogne via the Thames,
and then the steamers were called the <hi rend="italics">Albion</hi>, the
<hi rend="italics">Panther</hi>, and the<hi rend="italics"> City of Cologne</hi>.  I have been
told that the G.S.N.Co.-an association with a very

<pb id="p.288" n="288"/>


large fleet-moves its boats from station to station
as they grow older. For instance, when new, a
vessel may run between London and Bordeaux, then
from London to Margate, then ultimately appear as a
ferry-boat on the coast of Japan. I wonder what has
became of the <hi rend="italics">Albion</hi> and what has been the fate of a
steamer still older, <hi rend="italics">the Father Thames</hi>. In days gone
by they were thronged with passengers who had
every confidence in their sea-going qualities. I have
braved in their cabins (but in a half-hearted fashion)
many a bad passage. Peace be to their timbers if
still afloat, or if broken up, to their ashes.</p></div2>


         <div2 n="THE CURSE OF THE CHANNEL" type="subchapter" id="s190"><head>THE CURSE OF THE CHANNEL.</head>

  <p>On a bright sunshiny day there is nothing more
charming than a run over from Folkestone to
Boulogne, or from <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName> to <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName>. Those who
haunt the departure stages of the two southern
watering-places, will observe many a familiar face on
the boat that leaves the Admiralty Pier at 1 p.m.
and returns at 5.15. This vessel is particularly
favoured by the Bar during the vacation, and one
popular Recorder whose silk gown was constantly
worn at the C. C. C. in leading Treasury prosecutions,
is frequently seen pacing its quarter-deck. But when
the winds begin to blow, and the waves to rise, life
on board a Channel steamship becomes less tolerable.

<pb id="p.289" n="289"/>



There are any number of remedies for <foreign lang="FR">mal de mer</foreign>,
but none absolutely and invariably reliable. It is a
wise precaution to seat oneself amidships-just in rear
of the funnels and exactly between the paddle boxes.
Fresh air is very desirable, but sometimes it has to
be bought at the cost of a drenching. A glass of
champagne before starting or a lemon squash have
both their admirers, and I have been credibly informed that chloral taken under doctor's advice is
serviceable. But when I hear remedies for sea-sickness considered, I always think of that wonderful
series of pictures by Leech that amused our fathers
years ago. The cuts showed how a man should take
a hearty meal before leaving the shore, and then
stand firmly in the centre of the steamer with his eyes
fixed upon a distant object, and accommodating his
body to the movements of the vessel. <q>And then
the result would probably be this,</q> was the legend
of a final sketch showing the poor traveller in a
condition of comic collapse.</p></div2>

  <p>I think, on the whole, Englishmen are better
sailors than Frenchmen. Certainly an inspection of
<q>Mossoo</q> after a <q> dirty passage </q> is not calculated
to increase the prestige of <q> The Great Nation.</q> He
generally leans on the arm of his wife and is utterly


<pb id="p.290" n="290"/>




regardless of appearances.  His buttonhole of the
Legion of Honour is uncared for and he is feeble to
a degree. When asked brusquely whether he wishes
to go to <q> Charing Cross, Cannon Street, St. Paul's
or Victoria,</q> he replies in a broken voice that he
desires to be taken to <q> Londres.</q> Some years since,
I went over to <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> on a perfectly calm day (so it
appeared to all the English on board) <foreign lang="FR">en route</foreign> for
the south. As it was a trial trip, we had shipped
some <foreign lang="FR">douaniers</foreign> who were to inspect our luggage
while we were half seas over. When we got into
port at <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName>, we found that the representatives of
the French Customs had been too ill to attend to
their duties! And yet as I have said, the sea
appeared to us sturdy Britons as calm as a mill pond.
I suppose the affair is a matter of temperament
combined with nationality.</p></div2>


           <div2 n="THE RIGHT OF SEARCH" type="subchapter" id="s192"> <head> THE RIGHT OF SEARCH.</head>

  <p>Having referred to the <foreign lang="FR">douane</foreign> I must confess that
unless one's luggage is examined <foreign lang="FR">en route</foreign>, the right
of search is distinctly a nuisance. If you happen to
have a uniform, it is a good idea to put it on the
top of your clothes when travelling abroad. The
<foreign lang="FR">douaniers</foreign> have a certain respect for the military,
and when they see the scarlet and gold their inspection
becomes perfunctory. And you may take

<pb id="p.291" n="291"/>



it for granted that the foreigners will never be surprised
at any insular eccentricity. Many years ago I
was entrusted with a box containing wedding cake.
Of course the officer of <foreign lang="FR">douane</foreign> desired that it should
be exhibited.</p>
  <p><q> What is this droll kind of comestible? </q> he asked.</p>
  <p><q>A sort of plum pudding,</q> I promptly replied.</p>
  <p><q>Very good. You English are inexplicable;</q>
and he chalked the cover of the box. He was not
in the least astonished at my carrying a plum pudding
about with me. I venture to believe what caused his
surprise was that I had overlooked the roast beef, the
holly and mistletoe, and the mince pies!</p></div2>

                <div2 n="PROS AND CONS" type="subchapter" id="s193"><head>PROS AND CONS.</head>

<p>AS the season draws towards its close the stress and
tear of the business of either work or pleasure begins
to tell upon the average Londoner. A barrister well
served with briefs, a doctor with a long list of
patients, an editor, assisted by a large staff of contributors, have each in his way a good deal to do.
As January is lost in Easter, and Whitsuntide is
passed and forgotten in July, the longing for rest and
recreation grows stronger and stronger. The wish
becomes an earnest desire, when one's guide, philosopher and medical friend, Dr. Farren Farce, takes one
by the arm, and looking one in the face through his
benevolent spectacles, utters a remonstrance:</p>
  <p><q>Dear friend,</q> says the philanthropic physician,
<q>you are not appearing well. You want another
rest. Come to me to-morrow and I will tell you what
to do.</q></p>

<pb id="p.293" n="293"/>




  <p>So on the following morning one repairs to the
pleasant mansion of the ablest of men and receives
orders to be off to Cairo or the Canaries, Homburg
or Harrogate, or if complacent, a tour round the
world, beginning with the Cape. Whether the advice
is taken or not is another affair.</p></div2>

    <div2 n="RESULT OF NEGLECTING A SUGGESTION" type="subchapter" id="s195"><head>RESULT OF NEGLECTING A SUGGESTION.</head>

  <p>And now to consider the matter methodically.
Should Dr. Farren Farce's advice be followed?
Why, certainly, if possible. When the physician
steps in and interferes in the march of work, it is as
well to pay some attention to his cautions. It pays
in the long run. As a stitch in time saves nine, so
does a week in the country, passed at the proper
season, sometimes dispense with the necessity of
knocking off work for a year and a day.</p>
  <p>So we all agree that when the doctors speak we
should obey; and having come to this decision follow
our own devices. For all that the matter is scarcely
a subject that can be cured by jesting.</p></div2>

           <div2 n="THE ROTTEN ROW CURE" type="subchapter" id="s196"><head>THE ROTTEN ROW CURE.</head>

  <p>Very often one receives orders to take to riding.
Of course, if you happen to have a banking account
which never sinks to less on the credit side in the
pounds column than five figures in your pass-book, the

<pb id="p.294" n="294"/>



matter is as simple as possible. All you have to do
is to find a horse up to your weight. Having done
this (which you generally can manage with the
assistance of a friend), you can ride to your heart's
content in Rotten Row. But supposing you have
neglected to take the necessary biscuits, or your build
is hereditarily stalwart, or from some other unaccountable reason, you turn the scales at the club at
twenty-two stone, why, then you must travel further
north. I believe by arrangement you can always
secure a nice ride in the early morning at the Zoo on
the back of an elephant, but the mount naturally has
to be ordered well in advance.</p>
  <p>And here let me suggest that there can be no sight
more instructive and amusing to the Intelligent
Foreigner than a review of <q>the Liver Brigade</q> in
the early morning. When the shadows of the trees
bordering Rotten Row are still of measurable length,
it is delightful to watch the riders as they pass and
repass, now singly, now in couples, now in groups.
Here comes a famous artist in black and white,
looking like a farmer in his workaday clothes. He
is followed by an eminent Q.C. much in the same
costume. They are succeeded by judges, editors,
statesmen, and now and again by a bishop. Pot
hats, caps, even straw hats are used as a headgear.
Collars turned up, and suits of the loudest material.
If the various celebrities could be put as they are

<pb id="p.295" n="295"/>



in the scenes of their daily professional exploits
they would certainly cause a profound sensation.
For instance, how could the Q.C. cross-examine in
grey dittos and a red necktie? How could <q>my
lord</q> deliver judgment in an old woollen comforter?
How could the ecclesiastic preach in a cap calculated
to capture the taste of a costermonger? But in
Rotten Row everything is acceptable. I believe
Buffalo Bill, when he was last in England, frequently
appeared beneath the trees in his professional
toggery. If he did I am quite sure that his eminence
as a Society lion, and not the unconventionality of
his costume, attracted attention. Were a North
American Indian, of the old-fashioned Cooper novel
sort, to gallop through the Row, he would attract
little or no attention. All that would be said would,
no doubt, be uttered by the eminent artist in black
and white to whom I have already referred.
  <q>Yes,</q> my talented friend would observe, <q>very
nice indeed as a study, but his mocassins are all
wrong. If you wear feathers on your trousers you
should also wear feathers on your boots.</q></p></div2>


           <div2 n="SHORT CUTS TO HEALTH" type="subchapter" id="s197"><head>SHORT CUTS TO HEALTH.</head>

  <p>Now and again you come upon stories of the
marvellous effects of specialities. For instance, there
is one very well known in service circles as a certain

<pb id="p.296" n="296"/>




cure for gout. Several of my soldier and sailor
friends have tried it, and with great success. The
story goes that the members of a certain very distinguished
<q>service</q> club had very many years ago
a reputation for speaking on occasion harshly to the
waiters, and when much irritated making use of such
improper expressions as <q>Dear me!</q> <q>Dash it!</q>
and even (but this, of course, only on the rarest of
rare occasions) <q>Hang it! </q> The lamentable exhibitions of anger were entirely attributable to the prevalence of gout.</p>
  <p>According to the legend, by a sort of miracle it
became known to the members of the club that the
good sisters of a certain convent in foreign parts
supplied for twenty-five francs, a box of powders
that contained 365 packets. By taking one of the
nuns' prescriptions daily for a year a cure was performed, and the patient, from the most irritable
became one of the most amiable of men.</p>
  <p>Such is the story. It is said (and I believe with
truth) that nowadays the members of the service club
in question are so gentle in their manners, that they
serve as a contrast to the comparatively blustering
bishops in a well known literary <foreign lang="FR">cercle</foreign> located in the
near neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>However, lest it may be thought that this specific
for gout amongst the military is invariably infallible,
it is only right to say that I found it not entirely satisfactory


<pb id="p.297" n="297"/>




in one instance. A very old and valued
friend of mine tried it.</p>
  <p><q> Yes,</q> said he, <q> it certainly seemed to be affecting
me. But after I had got through half my box of
powders my doctor stopped the cure, as he said that
the remedy in gout was giving me the yellow
jaundice!</q></p>
  <p>But to be entirely just I must admit that my friend,
although one of the best and smartest soldiers I have
ever met, had only held a commission in the Auxiliary
Forces. To take proper effect the cure for gout
should be tried upon a Major-General at the least
-indeed, the nuns (so I have been told) prefer a
Field-Marshal.</p></div2>

               <div2 n="CALAIS OR CAIRO?" type="subchapter" id="s198"><head>CALAIS OR CAIRO?</head>

  <p>However, it is sometimes possible to carry out
doctor's orders without resorting to the extreme
measures conveyed in the medical commands. For
instance, only the other day I had a proof of the
convenient manner of obeying the spirit rather than
the words of the prescription. A very old and valued
friend of mine is accustomed to compare every now
and again what may be termed our mutual ailments.
As a rule, whoever commences the comparison has
to submit to the other going one better, or rather,
I should say, one worse. If I assert I have a bad
headache my friend not only has a raging pain in the

<pb id="p.298" n="298"/>




forehead, but that pain extends right down the neck.
If he tells me that he believes he has incipient lumbago, I assure him that I am quite certain I am in
the first stage of rapidly-creeping paralysis.</p>
  <p><q>I did not sleep last night,</q> said my friend, a day
or two ago.</p>
  <p><q>Why, I have had chronic insomnia ever since the
middle of March,</q> was my prompt reply, going,
according to the rule of the game, one worse.</p>
  <p><q>The only thing to cure me,</q> continued my comrade in adversity, <q>is a sea voyage to Cairo.</q></p>
  <p><q>I feel convinced I shall never be myself until I
have been to Australia and back on a trading vessel,</q>
I put in again, scoring cleverly.</p>
  <p><q> Quite so,</q> said my friend, <q>but unfortunately I
can only spare half a week.</q></p>
  <p><q> And I the inside hours of a Sunday.</q></p>
  <p>The last statements were not only interesting to
ourselves, but had the additional merit of being
absolutely accurate. So we determined, as the lesser
commanded the greater, we would see what could be
done within the inside hours of a Sunday.</p>
 <p><q>Why not go to Boulogne by the <hi rend="italics">Marguerite</hi>? </q></p>
  <p>But that necessitated very early rising, and my
friend and I came to the conclusion that as we were
both suffering from insomnia we ought not to think
of moving until 9 a.m. I am not sure that we had
any doctor's opinion to support our contention, but

<pb id="p.299" n="299"/>


we had a pious belief that to stay in bed until the
sun was ready to receive was emphatically the right

 <p> <q>Why not go to <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> and back? </q> asked my
friend, as if he were putting a conundrum full of
pleasing possibilities.</p>
  <p><q>Yes,</q> I answered. <q>Why not? As a matter of
fact I believe that the <foreign lang="FR">buffet</foreign> at the station is a most
excellent one. Is not lunch a safe cure for
insomnia ?</q></p>
  <p><q>Unquestionably, if taken  after an appetite
creating sea voyage. And we could avoid the risk
of endangering our health by getting up too early,
as the mail train does not leave Victoria until eleven
o'clock.</q></p></div2>

             <div2 n="A PLEASANT JOURNEY" type="subchapter" id="s199"><head>A PLEASANT JOURNEY.</head>

  <p>This consideration decided us to make the experiment.
So a few minutes before the appointed hour
we appeared on the platform in that light and airy
costume the delight of tourists of the better class.</p>
 <p> <q type="spoken">Shall I get your luggage labelled, sir?</q> asked an
attentive guard.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">We have no luggage,</q> was our triumphant reply.
And, carrying nothing but two thin overcoats and a
couple of genuine Sunday newspapers, we took our
places in a comfortable compartment and started for
<placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>. We devoured the contents of the couple of

<pb id="p.300" n="300"/>



genuine Sunday newspapers with the usual delight.
They were, as is their custom of a Sabbath morn,
replete with excellent matter. Then when we
reached Chatham we laid them aside. Our insomnia
did not permit us to sleep; so we only closed our
eyes and allowed ourselves to drift into unconsciousness.
When we opened our eyes (with a start) we
found ourselves at <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Luggage labelled, sir?</q> asked the guard.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">We have no luggage!</q> we replied with pride.
Fortunately our eminently respectable appearance
disarmed unworthy suspicion, and we were not
arrested as Anarchists.</p>
  <p>We embarked on board the <hi rend="italics">Lord Warden</hi>. We
met several friends who were going on to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>.
They were not so sure of our destination.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">I suppose,</q> said one of them with detective-like
sagacity, <q type="spoken">that you propose crossing the Channel?</q></p>
  <p>As we were seated on lounging chairs on the upper
deck, and the steamboat had already left the <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>
pier, we admitted the soft impeachment.</p>
  <p><q> I wonder how people come to think of such clever
things,</q> I murmured to my comrade. To which
question he languidly replied that he considered the
rival to Sherlock Holmes <q>a stupid ass.</q></p>
  <p>After this I was silent. We spent an hour in
drinking the pure air of the Channel. The sea was

<pb id="p.301" n="301"/>


as smooth as a mill pond, and the breezes were
delightful.</p></div2>

       <div2 n="A COUPLE OF HOURS IN FRANCE" type="subchapter" id="s200"><head>A COUPLE OF HOURS IN FRANCE.</head>

  <p>We arrived. As we walked on shore the rival to
Sherlock Holmes made another discovery. <q>If you
are not going further, I suppose you will stay at
<placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> ? </q></p>
  <p>Again my comrade muttered <q> stupid ass,</q> and led
the way to the <foreign lang="FR">buffet</foreign>.</p>
  <p>I shall never forget the luncheon. It was excellent.
<foreign lang="FR">Poulet roti</foreign> with <foreign lang="FR">pommes sautes</foreign>, some <foreign lang="FR">petits
pois</foreign> and a <foreign lang="FR">langue de boeuf</foreign>, <foreign lang="FR">sauce piquante</foreign>. This,
with a bottle of white <foreign lang="FR">vin ordinaire</foreign>, some black
coffee, and a <foreign lang="FR">chasse</foreign>, came to twelve francs.</p>
  <p><foreign lang="FR"><q>Avez-vous de monnaie pour un sovereign-un
piece de vingt-cinq francs?</q> </foreign>asked my friend, in
that admirable French which in years gone by was
the envy and astonishment of his school-fellows at
Eton.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Certainly, sare,</q> returned the waiter, <q type="spoken">I give you
eleven shillings change. Will you read <hi rend="italic">The Observer,</hi>
<hi rend="italic">The Sunday Times,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>?</q></p>
  <p>We returned to the <hi rend="italics">Lord Warden</hi> in comfort.
We took up our position in two well-situated
arm-chairs. We watched the luggage of the poor
passengers from <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> and Brussels coming down

<pb id="p.302" n="302"/>




the slope with more or less expedition, and more or
less wear and tear to the fabric of the boxes.</p>
  <p>We got back to <placeName key="Dover">Dover</placeName>, after a most delightful
voyage, by about five o'clock. Tea was awaiting us
at the station. We quaffed a cup, and, once more
closing our eyes and resigning ourselves to unconsciousness,
got back to town by a little after seven
o'clock. The next morning I met my comrade's
doctor. He told me how he had directed his patient
to take a sea passage to Egypt.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">But you, dear friend, seem the picture of health,</q>
he exclaimed. <q type="spoken"><hi rend="italics">You</hi> don't want to go to Cairo.</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">No,</q> I replied, <q type="spoken"> I don't, because I have been to
<placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName>.</q></p>
  <p>And with this apparently pointless remark I
brought our interview to an abrupt conclusion-like
this chapter.</p></div2>

<p>I AM told (and I have every reason for believing
that the assertion is true) that a large number of
Londoners never take a holiday. Professional men
have their <q> close time,</q> which mercifully forces them
to desist from  their labour.  For instance, the
barrister, unless he makes himself a slave to vacation
work, gets away in the middle of August, and is not
wanted back in the Royal Palace in the Strand until
the end of October. Then the doctor, prescribing
for himself, takes a clear two months in the dead
season of the year. But the journalist (especially if
he be an editor), like the late Lord <persName key="Tennyson,Alfred">Tennyson</persName>'s
Brook, <q>goes on for ever.</q> A friend of mine, who
some years ago had been following the <q> active duties
of his profession</q> for any number of years, had a
very unpleasant reminder that <q>human nature after
all is human nature.</q> One day he met that eminent

<pb id="p.304" n="304"/>



physician, Dr. Farren Farce, in a railway carriage.
he other occupants of the compartment were a
married couple-a man who seemed to be a confirmed invalid, and his devoted wife. The husband
was feeble to the last degree, with lack-lustre eyes,
and the gait of a nonogenarian who has borne his
years badly. At the station <foreign lang="FR">en route</foreign> the poor fellow
was helped out of the train by his sorrowful and
sympathetic helpmate, and struggled away towards
the exit gate, with the assistance of the ticket collector and a couple of porters.</p>
  <p><q> You should feel a special interest in that group,</q>
said Dr. Farren Farce to my friend, <q>because, my
dear fellow, unless you immediately knock off work
and take a complete holiday you will find yourself
in the same plight within the next fortnight.</q></p>
  <p>And the eminent physician was a true prophet.
My friend did not act upon the medico's advice, and
became absolutely incapacitated for the lightest work
for no less than two years. He found himself without
memory, without energy, without everything. He
was a perfect wreck, and it took twenty-four calendar
months to bring him back to his customary condition. So when Dr. Farren Farce takes me by
the arm, and, calling me <q>dear friend,</q> tells me to
<q> pull up,</q> I invariably do my best to obey his commands. And it really is wonderful how little time
you need to follow the prescription. As I am nothing

<pb id="p.305" n="305"/>



if not practical, I will do my best to show in how
short a space the thing can be done. I will suppose
myself a London journalist at the end of the
nineteenth century, who cannot possibly get away from
town for more than three week-days. I may do
what I please with Sunday and Monday; Tuesday
and Wednesday are entirely at my service; but I
have to be at the office on Thursday. How am I
to get the complete rest the Dr. Farren Farce has
ordered for his <q>dear friend</q> in the first four days
of the week ? We will see.</p></div2>


  <div2 n="A JOURNEY ABROAD.-PARIS FOR CHOICE" type="subchapter" id="s202"><head>A JOURNEY ABROAD.-PARIS FOR CHOICE.</head>

  <p>If you have been very hard pressed, and have not
had leisure to leave your native country for some time,
there is no better place for a complete change than
foreign parts. I think I may say that the golden
rule for the overworked is <q> when in doubt try <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>.</q>
And the regulation (like a similar decree in the game
of whist) will usually resolve into trumps. Yes, there
is no place like the capital of France for the weary
journalist whose ears are deaf to any sound but
<placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> echoes. When a man has become a
burden to himself and a nuisance to his neighbours
he had better go to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>-he will find the journey
there beneficial, and pleasanter than a trip either to
Bath or Coventry. Then there is the way of going:


<pb id="p.306" n="306"/>




the Newhaven-Dieppe route is very pleasant,
especially in the summer; the boats are now always
excellent, and the passage takes only half-a-dozen
hours; but if you are very pressed for time I think
you cannot do better than to trust yourself and your
fortunes (represented by a small Gladstone bag) to
the South Eastern and Chatham and Dover Railways.
If you are single, there is no reason why you should
not travel by night; but if you are to be accompanied
by your wife, you had better make your
journey in the daytime. There is nothing like sunlight
for facing your enemy-and by the foe I do
not mean your better seven-eighths, but the sea.
And at all times you will find the after-effects of
the night travelling rather trying. The shadow of
the <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> lights will cast a gloom over your <foreign lang="FR">dejeuner</foreign>,
and the long journey between <q> the label on Mary's
heart,</q> and the <q> ground surrounding the Tour Eiffel</q>
will spoil the pleasure of the afternoon walk on the
boulevard s, the dinner (say) at Bignon's and the
<foreign lang="FR">fauteuil</foreign> at the Vaudeville. So make up your mind
to a daylight voyage and a good night's rest. You
will not regret your decision, although you may
possibly sigh as you think of the time when packing
at five, eating at six, starting at eight, and <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> in
the dawn of the following morning, were matters of
course.</p></div2>

<pb id="p.307" n="307"/>




  <div2 n="WHAT TO TAKE AND HOW TO TAKE IT" type="subchapter" id="s203"><head>WHAT TO TAKE AND HOW TO TAKE IT.</head>

  <p>I will assume that I, in my character of Dr. Farren
Farce's <q>dear friend,</q> have decided to <q>pop over
to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>.</q> Believing courteously that the presence of
my better seven-eighths, although doubling the expense,
quadruples the pleasure of the journey, I
have taken coupons for two. My first anxiety is
about the luggage. I explain that if I register the
Gladstone bag there will be delay at the <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> terminus, and delay means no <foreign lang="FR">table d'hote</foreign> at the Grand.
For the regulation (which is a trifle stricter than the
laws of the Medes and Persians) declares that no
would-be reveller shall enter the <foreign lang="FR">salle a manger</foreign>
after half-past seven. And as (when I am in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>)
I am nothing if not greedy, this rule is of the utmost
importance. So I take my Gladstone bag, my hatbox, and a roll of coats with me in the carriage.
My bag contains the regulation necessaries, inclusive
of evening clothes for myself, and several <q> dreams
in satin and lace</q> belonging to my better
seven-eighths; the hat-box, besides the go-to-meeting
topper, all that was crowded out of the bag; and
the roll of coats beyond the garments named, all
the things that have been crowded out of the hat-box.
It is, consequently, a relief to me that the
<placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> <foreign lang="FR">douanier</foreign> (a gentleman who, commencing with

<pb id="p.308" n="308"/>



an extremely military cap, suddenly drops into mufti
from his chin downwards) does not order the roll
of coats to be examined. If, instead of marking
the bundle with a <q> 2,</q> he had insisted upon its being
opened, he would have been surprised at the vastness
and variety of its contents. Later on, when I ask
what have become of my collars, my boot-jack, my
slippers, my frock-coat, my writing-packet, my
sponges, my toilette requisites, my white ties, my
reserve of cigars, and my prayer-book, I am told,
and accurately told, that they are all in the bundle.
And here I may hint that as the roll of coats is so
full of good things, it is as well to have it firmly
strapped up before starting. It is distinctly embarrassing
if it comes undone (as I have known it to
do) when it is being conveyed by a youthful mariner
from the train to the boat.</p></div2>


     <div2 n="EN ROUTE BY THE 11 O'CLOCK EXPRESS" type="subchapter" id="s204"><head>EN ROUTE BY THE 11 O'CLOCK EXPRESS.</head>

  <p>Of the journey to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> I may note a few points.
I am travelling on Sunday (by starting at eleven there
is plenty of time for breakfast and church); so I have
my favourite journal, which I can read at my leisure.
During the journey I notice a vast number of other
passengers engaged in the same pleasant occupation.
I heartily confess that during the seven hours and
three-quarters devoted to the journey from London

<pb id="p.309" n="309"/>




to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> I read it all  If your better seven-eighths
does not look at the pages of <hi rend="italics">The Observer</hi>, she
glances at those other leaves-the leaves on the trees.</p>
  <p><q> They are moving! </q> she exclaims, <q>I am sure it
will be rough! </q></p>
  <p>It is just possible that there may be a hurricane
taking place. Castles and farmhouses, to say nothing
of oaks centuries old, may be disappearing before the
force of the elements. But even then it is necessary
to assure the lady <q> that it is quite certain to be calm,
and that the sea will be like a lake.</q> It would be
cruel, it would be unmanly, nay it would be inconvenient to say anything else. Once on board, strongly
recommend the ladies' cabin and disappear yourself
into the smoking-room. Until you reach <placeName key="Calais">Calais</placeName> the
rest had better be silence.</p>
  <p>At the <foreign lang="FR">buffet</foreign> ask for the menu, order your lunch
with promptitude and command a bottle of <foreign lang="FR">Vin
rouge ordinaire</foreign>. The tedious railway journey to the
capital comes to an end at last, and then with luck
you get into your voiture and find yourself in the
courtyard of the Grand Hotel, in time for one of the
best <foreign lang="FR">tables d'hote</foreign> in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>-which is France-which
is the world! Which is London! More or less!</p></div2>

  <div2 n="VIEWS OF LIFE FROM AN EXALTED POSITION" type="subchapter" id="s205"><head>VIEWS OF LIFE FROM AN EXALTED POSITION.</head>
  <p>I have been wise. Knowing that the Fair City
is <foreign lang="FR">en fete</foreign> I have written for a room. I hear that

<pb id="p.310" n="310"/>



scores and hundreds of would-be sojourners have
been turned away. But to me is given a small book
and a key. Then I enter the lift, and ascend to a
dizzy height.  For the moment I feel like <persName key="Louis XVI.">Louis
XVI.</persName> when, described as the son of the saint, he was
invited to <q> <foreign lang="FR">montez au ciel.</foreign></q> But I get no further in
that direction than the <foreign lang="FR">cinquieme etage</foreign>. Later on I
suggest that something lower would suit me equally
well, and I descend. Still, there are worse places in
the world than a room <foreign lang="FR"><q> au cinquieme,</q></foreign> overlooking
the boulevards at the Grand Hotel. Of course it is
economical, and then I fancy you can see (with the aid
of a telescope) down some of the chimneys of the
neighbouring houses. But this is a fancy, and nothing
more.</p>
 <p> I am in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, and everything is fresh and charming. It is Monday, and having had a good night's
rest I am fit for anything. A <q> complete tea</q> (taken
in the residential rival to the summit of the Tour
Eiffel) has made us regardless of the pangs of hunger
until one o'clock, so we determine to see all <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>.
How is it done? Nothing easier. Patronise the omnibuses and tramcars. All we have to do is to climb
up on a vehicle labelled <q> Madeleine-Bastille,</q> and
you are carried to one or the other. Then get on to
a coach bearing the legend <q>Louvre,</q> and you are
taken there. Lastly, you ascend a carriage inscribed
<q>Opera, Place de la Concorde, Ternes,</q> and you are

<pb id="p.311" n="311"/>


conveyed everywhere. If you wish to do the place
thoroughly, seeing all the latest improvements and
new buildings, you can spend hours and hours upon
the omnibuses. Let them take you where they will,
and supposing you have not been in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> for a year
or two, you will find every yard of the ground interesting.</p>
  <p>Of course if you want to go to the Bois (which, by
the way, Zola considered finer than our parks and
gardens!) you can take a voiture, at 2.50 the hour;
ninety minutes will be quite enough of it in the autumn, when the leaves are falling and the lakes look
<q>damp </q> and cheerless. But I cannot recommend a
breakfast at the <hi rend="italics">cafe</hi> either in the wood or the
Champs Elysees.</p></div2>


           <div2 n="ENGLISH ACTORS IN PARIS" type="subchapter" id="s206"><head>ENGLISH ACTORS IN PARIS.</head>

  <p>Of course you have an inclination to visit the
theatres. But just now there is nothing new save the
last play by Sardou, and a rather naughty piece of
magic nonsense. I am in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, and what are they
playing? Why, any number of revivals. And in all
<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> not a single English piece, not a single English
actor! Certainly British histrions are at a discount
just now in the city of Corneille and Moliere!</p>
  <p>The last time that an Anglo-Saxon actor made a
stand in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> was, I fancy, when Sothern went over

<pb id="p.312" n="312"/>



to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> during the Exhibition year of <date value="1867">1867</date>, and
played <hi rend="italics">Lord Dundreary</hi>. It was not a success. I am
not quite sure whether this appearance was prior or
subsequent to the <foreign lang="FR">debut</foreign> of Charles Mathews in
<foreign lang="FR">L'Anglais Timide</foreign>. By the way, I have heard a good
story told about this last-mentioned piece. I fancy it
was originally written by an Englishman (I think
Blanchard Jerrold, son of Douglas), and played in
London, then translated into French, then re-translated back into English under the title of As Cool as
a Cucumber; then re-translated again into French
when Charles Mathews accepted his Parisian engagement. I remember hearing Charles Mathews saying
that his brother actors were utterly surprised at the
way he rehearsed the play. In his days it was the
custom to merely walk through the part, indicating in
the faintest manner the <q> business.</q> The French, on
the contrary, rehearsed everything as if they, had a
critical audience in front of them instead of an empty
auditorium. On <q>the night</q> his fellow actors were
astounded at <q> Charley's</q> success, and I am glad to
say gratified. But I must not talk about the drama in
<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, as I have to get back to work in town.</p></div2>

             <div2 n="BACK AGAIN TO TOWN" type="subchapter" id="s207"><head>BACK AGAIN TO TOWN.</head>

  <p>Tuesday is like unto Monday. I managed to see
the Musee Gravin, but when I proposed to visit the

<pb id="p.313" n="313"/>


Louvre it was suggested to me by an influential
authority <q> that really it was a pity when one was in
<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> to waste time upon things like that.</q>  Not that
the influential authority did not admire art, <q> but art
was long and lasting and Parisian bonnets ever
changing.</q> So the visit to the Louvre was changed
to a visit to the Magasins du Louvre. And I must
confess there was much more novelty about the latter
than the former. Again omnibuses, again <foreign lang="FR">table d'hote</foreign>
breakfasts (four <foreign lang="FR">plats au choix</foreign>) and dinners. Again
new faces, new people, new uniforms, new surroundings, new everything.
  When we returned about the middle of the week,
after two clear days in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, it seemed as if we had
been away for months. My friend, Dr. Farren Farce,
happened to be on the platform. The eminent physician beamed through his benevolent glasses. Then
he smilingly addressed me:</p>
  <p><q>Dear friend! You were right to take my advice.
Now you can go on for another twelvemonth, if need
be, without bad results. Satisfactory, dear friend;
most satisfactory! </q></p>
  <p>And the <q> dear friend </q> had nothing to say to the
contrary.

<p>A LONDONER must preserve his health, and at the
close of the century the doctors admit rivals to the
continental watering-places. Nowadays, it is quite a
common experience to hear Sir William This and Sir
Robert That speaking with respect of Buxton, Tunbridge Wells, and Harrogate; and the autumn is
the pleasantest time for a sojourn at these reviving
watering-places. I have been to most of them and
think I may, after mature consideration, declare my
preference for the half-way town between London
and Hastings. The site of <q>Ye Pantyles</q> is still
fashionable, and in very much the same condition (if
one is able to judge from contemporary prints and
old guide-books) that it was just a century ago; and
furthermore, the death-rate seems as low now as it
was a hundred years since.</p></div2>

       <div2 n="DR. MAYFAIR AND HIS PATIENTS" type="subchapter" id="s209"><head>DR. MAYFAIR AND HIS PATIENTS.</head>

  <p>How did I come to travel to <q>the survival of the
Georges</q>? Why, thanks to <q>doctor's orders,</q> I

<pb id="p.315" n="315"/>



had been sounded and thumped and made to jump on
one leg. Then my medical friend had listened to
my breathing, with the assistance of a stethoscope,
as if he were trying to carry on a conversation with
some distant friend through a slightly damaged
telephone.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">You want change of air,</q> said the doctor, laying
down the stethoscope, <q type="spoken">and rest if you can get it.</q></p>
  <p>I explained that rest was out of the question, but
I might perhaps steal an occasional <q type="spoken">Sunday to
Wednesday morning</q> away from town.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">I suppose,</q> he continued, <q type="spoken">you could not arrange
to take a yachting tour in the Mediterranean? You
could not meet the boat at Marseilles and coast along
Southern Europe, touching at Genoa, Leghorn and
Venice ?</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Well, no,</q> I replied; <q type="spoken">I do not think I could
manage it. You see, that sort of thing cannot be got
through in fifty-six hours.</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Very likely; very likely,</q> admitted the worthy
nineteenth century representative of AEsculapius.
<q type="spoken">Then how about Skye or Switzerland?</q></p>
  <p><q> Both impossible, for the same consideration.</q></p>
  <p><q type="spoken">Well, I suppose we must fall back upon England,</q>
said my medical mentor in a tone of disappointment.
<q type="spoken">If you can't manage to get to the Mediterranean or
Lucerne or even Portree, why you had better go to
Tunbridge Wells.</q></p>

<pb id="p.316" n="316"/>




  <p>So from this I gathered that the Kentish-Sussex
<q type="spoken">watering-place</q> had a kinship (in air) with Switzerland,
the Highlands, and Italy. I am nothing if not
practical, and so I call upon health-seekers to make
a note of this conjecture.</p>
  <p>Then Tunbridge had a further advantage. It was
within easy reach of town and served by two excellent
railway companies. First there was the South
Eastern, which landed you at the foot of Mount
Pleasant (which by the way might be called Mount
Unpleasant when you have to ascend it), close to
<q> favourite residences</q> on Mount Ephraim and in
Calverley Park; and next there was the London,
Brighton and South Coast, which invited you to
descend (a much better phrase than <q> turn you out </q>)
in the neighbourhood of <q>Ye Pantyles.</q> The fares
of these trains were reasonable, and the time-tables
entirely satisfactory. I found I could get to Tunbridge
Wells in little over an hour, and that the
starting fixtures were well selected. What more
could be desired by a Londoner attracted to town by
the magnet of editorial work?</p></div2>


 <div2 n="A SNAIL-WAY GUIDE, BY J. ASHBY STERRY" type="subchapter" id="s210"> <head><q>A SNAIL-WAY GUIDE,</q> BY J. ASHBY STERRY.</head>

 	<p>I have had the advantage of a quiet perusal of the
<q>Snail-Way Guide</q> of my friend Mr. Ashby Sterry,
in which the charms of Tunbridge Wells are duly

<pb id="p.317" n="317"/>





set forth. The <q> Lazy Minstrel</q> delights in descriptions of the Common, <q>Ye Pantyles,</q> and the
magnificent country surrounding High Rocks and
Rusthall Church. To those who admire a series of
charming word-pictures, I confidently recommend
this little work. It is not in the least like an ordinary
guide-book, inasmuch as it comes from the desk of
an accomplished essayist, of whom it may be said
that his pencil and his pen are equally graceful,
equally eloquent, equally fanciful. I have the less
hesitation in recommending my friend's <q> Snail-Way
Guide </q> to the general public, as I have every reason
for believing it is out of print, and that its present
price is about the dozen times the charge made by
the original publishers. So my recommendation
cannot be stigmatised as an advertisement, but
merely accepted as the possible cause of a fruitless
search ending happily at last in the reading-room of
the British Museum. If I am not mistaken, a volume
once costing only a few coppers can now only be
purchased by gold or its equivalent. And if any of
my readers are inclined to possess themselves of the
<q>Snail-way Guide</q> at the increased price, I do not
think they will have any cause to regret the bargain.
The beauties of Tunbridge Wells are painted in
words, and each syllable is worth its weight in
diamonds.</p></div2>

 <div2 n="ADVANTAGES OF THE BEAU OF WATERING-PLACES" type="subchapter" id="s211"><head> ADVANTAGES OF <q>THE BEAU OF WATERING-PLACES.</q></head>


  <p>And what are the chief attractions of this <q> survival
of the eighteenth century?</q> Well, I think I
may say <q>air.</q>   The breezes that are wafted
across the Common at all times are full of
health.  You inhale new life and energy as you
sit in front of an hotel that boldly announces
(on its wall) that it is many hundred feet above
the sea level.  If the weather is boisterous you
can seek the shelter of the valley. Fall to the level
of <q> Ye Pantyles,</q> and you are surrounded on all
sides by hills that have been accustomed for centuries
to set the winds at utter defiance and to treat the
hurricane as a negligible quantity. Even on the
hottest day of August there is a breeze on the Common. Then there are the waters that are healing
medicines. They are full of iron, so are greatly
patronised by those in search of strength or with a
preference for water tasting of ink.</p>
  <p>As to the hotels and boarding-houses I am not
in a position to say much. I stayed once at a capital
hostelrie on Mount Ephraim, and believe there are
other establishments equally good. I may hint, too,
that on Mount Ephraim you can get a charmingly
furnished house for about four or five guineas a week.

	<p>My friend Ashby Sterry was right in making his
guide a <q> Snail-Way</q> specimen. Life in Tunbridge
Wells is quiet to a degree. There is a story that the
gayer of the inhabitants spent their existence in six
months of anticipation of delight and six months in
pleasant recollections around the central event of the
year's story, the visit of a famous conjuror to the
Large Hall. I happened to be staying in the town
when this function came off, and can testify to the
excitement caused by the display of the portraits
of the wonder-worker. Crowds flattened their noses
against the shop windows in which these pleasing
features were displayed.</p>
  <p>Then there is the band daily on <q> Ye Pantyles,</q>
where, for the price of one penny, one can get a
chair with a programme of the music thrown in
free, gratis, and for nothing. The bandmaster is
fond of classical music, and frequently <q>drops into
Handel.</q> When he does, it is not difficult to people
the old promenade with persons of the period-Dr.
Johnson and Boswell, Steele and Addison, Angelica
Kaufmann and Sir Joshua Reynolds; and, of course,
my Lord Lovelace and my Lady Bettie Modish, and

<pb id="p.320" n="320"/>



all the belles from the Mall and the beaux from the
<q>waiters' coffee-houses.</q>  They pace up and down
<q>Ye Pantyles,</q> as you listen with half-closed eyes to
the strains of the band. And here, by the way, why
not reproduce Tunbridge Wells on the stage? What
an excellent <q>scene</q> for a theatrical management
strong in its painting room!</p></div2>

<div2 n="A RECOLLECTION OF THE LATE DAVID JAMES" type="subchapter" id="s213"><head>A RECOLLECTION OF THE LATE DAVID JAMES.</head>

  <p>And this reference to the drama reminds me that
while I was there I assisted at the performance of
<hi rend="italics">Our Boys</hi> at Tunbridge Wells, in the Large Hall, and
had the pleasure of seeing my friend Thomas Thorne
in the character rendered famous by David James.
I little thought when I was marking the differences
between the two readings that I never should look
upon the original again. The first time I met David
James was after the production of <hi rend="italics">Ixion</hi> at the
Royalty. I had just made the acquaintance of the
author of the famous burlesque, and at a dinner at
which I was present, given by Frank Marshall to
Alfred Wigan, Joseph Robins and Burnand, the latter
spoke of the great possibilities of the coming actor.
Mr. David James was cast for a comparatively small
part, but he played it to the entire satisfaction of a
rather exigent author. Mr. Burnand said that from
what he had seen of his acting at rehearsal he was
sure he would be <q>very good.</q> And so he was.

<pb id="p.321" n="321"/>




From his first appearance at the little Royalty he was
a favourite with the Press. He played in several of
Burnand's burlesques (and they were something like
burlesques in those days!), first at Dean Street, Soho,
and then at the Strand. He was always excellent.
When David James and Thomas Thorne were at the
Vaudeville I had a near chance of seeing them in one
of my own pieces; they both read it and said they
both liked it. They sent for me and told me that
they considered it could be cast from the existing
company.</p>
  <p><q type="spoken">And we should be glad to play it at once,</q> said
David James, <q type="spoken">had we not given <persName key="Byron, Henry J.">Byron</persName>  a commission which should be our next production. However, he
is very backward with his work, and the third act is
not yet delivered. If he doesn't hurry up, and we
don't get the act in a fortnight, your piece shall have
the preference.</q></p>
  <p>My friend H. J. <persName key="Byron, Henry J.">Byron</persName> , however, did <q>hurry up</q>
and the third act was duly delivered. The piece to
which it belonged was <hi rend="italics">Our Boys</hi>, which ran without
stopping for five years! My excellent play (I am
afraid it has grown rather old-fashioned) is still
tenderly cherished-on my bookshelves!

Vaudeville Theatre. But if the operation were reversed I am not sure that the experiment would not
be successful. I am not quite sure what is being
played at the old house at this moment. But tired
brains from the play-houses, not only in the Strand
but elsewhere, will find Tunbridge Wells a delightful
restorative. It is quaint and beautiful, old-fashioned
and lovely beyond compare. Above all and before
all, it is the very land of health. Invalids revive like
drooping flowers thirsting for water on the appearance of a summer shower. There are shops of all
sorts and conditions; but during my stay I never
noticed the presence of an establishment belonging
to an undertaker. And this being so, I venture to
raise the appropriate cry of <q>Tunbridge Wells and
its inhabitants for ever!</q></p></div2>

<div2 n="THE PARISIAN PART OF THE LONDON DISTRICT." type="subchapter" id="s215"><head>THE PARISIAN PART OF THE LONDON DISTRICT.</head>

<p>A CHAPTER or two back I had the pleasure of showing
how a trip to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> could be easily managed
within the space of three clear days. It has occurred
to me that I might say a little more, once again
adopting the theory of the journalists that the French
capital is a part of the London district. I will imagine
the travelling over. I have braved the passage
between England and France and have reached the
Gare du Nord after a long and fatiguing railway
journey. It is the early morning, and in the coming
daylight I can see the well-known hoarding that
advertises on the sides of houses the sartorial generosity
of the <foreign lang="FR"><q>bon diable.</q></foreign> Where shall I go? No doubt
I have decided already, and have told the sleepy
coachman of my voiture to make for the <q>Grand.</q>
If I have been ultra wise I shall have written to the
hostelrie in the Boulevards des Capucines and

<pb id="p.324" n="324"/>



commanded my room. It is the safest thing to do. I
know of nothing more mortifying than to be sent
away from the doors of an hotel on the score that
there is no accommodation. You feel rather like my
friend Mr. J. L. Molloy's <q>Vagabond </q>-<q> homeless,
ragged, and tanned.</q> But the vagrant in the song
has this pull over you-he was not encumbered with
luggage, and had not to settle up with a sometimes
insolent and invariably surly coachman at the end of
his peregrinations.</p></div2>


          <div2 n="THE CHOICE OF AN HOTEL" type="subchapter" id="s216"><head>THE CHOICE OF AN HOTEL.</head>

  <p>Say that we have decided to stay at the Grand.
It unquestionably has its advantages. Its courtyard
is certainly a scene of never-ceasing gaiety, and it is
said that you have only to seat yourself outside the
<foreign lang="FR">salon de lecture</foreign> on the terrace to meet <q>all <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>.</q>
Then there is the <foreign lang="FR">table d'hote</foreign> breakfast, which is
patronised not only by MM. les Voyageurs but by the
natives also. If you partake of this meal with your
wife, the course consists of four dishes at choice, to
say nothing of <foreign lang="FR">hors d'oeuvres</foreign>.  From a diversified
<foreign lang="FR">carte du jour</foreign> (including oysters, partridges, mayonnaise
d'homard, chateaubriands, and any number of
other palatable <foreign lang="FR">plats</foreign>) you can, by making a wise selection,
secure a meal worthy of a Catullus. And yet
there are Goths who sometimes, in reply to the

<pb id="p.325" n="325"/>




<foreign lang="FR">garcon</foreign>, announce that for <q>their first dish they will
have boiled eggs, and for the other, eggs and bacon! </q>
Oh, the pity o' it! The pity o' it!</p>
  <p>Then there is the reading-room, with its papers and
its theatrephones. This last is rather an institution.
During the hours of performance you can hear what
is going on at the Opera, the Bouffes, and many other
French theatres. By putting fifty centimes in the slot
you have the privilege of listening for five minutes,
and by inserting a franc the advantage is extended to
twice that length of time. I cannot say that I was
entirely satisfied with my investment. Once I heard
(amidst a whirl) what seemed to me to be the finale of
a first act. Then I distinctly made out the clapping,
and I transferred the tubes to my better seven-eighths,
and she, too, heard the applause. We were greatly
pleased at this triumph of civilisation, but came to the
conclusion that our assistance of the performance resembled not a little the glimpse of the circus riding
obtained by Leech's boy while looking under the
tent's canvas. He could see the <q>'oofs of the 'osses,</q>
and so-from a musical point of view-could we!</p></div2>


    <div2 n="THE HOTEL DU LOUVRE AND ITS RIVALS" type="subchapter" id="s217"><head> THE HOTEL DU LOUVRE AND ITS RIVALS.</head>

  <p>Of course there are other excellent hotels besides
the Grand. There are any number on the Boulevards; along the Rue de Rivoli; in the Rue St.

<pb id="p.326" n="326"/>


Honore. In the days of my youth I used to like the
Grand Hotel du Louvre. It still exists, but its ancient
site is now occupied by the Magasins, the delight of
the ladies and the terror of their remaining <q> eighths.</q>
The other day, when I passed through what used to
be the courtyard, I found it full of all sorts of <q> high
novelties.</q> Here were some feather ruffs, there a
miscellaneous collection of bonnets all ticketed ten
francs a piece, yonder a great bazaar of <q> voyage articles.</q> I could not help sighing when I thought of
the past, and I feel certain that my melancholy would
have become chronic had not my better seven-eighths
cheered me up by wanting to buy a Franco-Russian
fan, an eiderdown quilt, four umbrellas, a trunk, a
dozen and a half of blankets, a few hats, some curtains, a gauzy arrangement for the front of the dress
<q>that could be worn with anything,</q> and a
dining-room table. We did not purchase all these articles,
and those we did I am bound to say we found a
nuisance. I put some of the blankets, two of the umbrellas, and the fan in my bundle of coats, and unfortunately these did not seem to agree with my recently polished evening boots and my partially opened
sponge-bag. But, of course, you cannot expect everything to go like clockwork when travelling. Still, it
must be supposed that a feather fan, representing the
Franco-Russian colours, is not improved by the application of escaped boot polish and liberated Odonto.

<pb id="p.327" n="327"/>




  Leaving the reduced Louvre, we may patronise, if
we please, the increased Hotel de Lille et d'Albion.
Years ago this was quite a small place, and the original
site is now occupied (I fancy) by the Hotel St. James.
In its present form it is not bad, still it is <q> very English.</q> Breakfast is distinctly breakfast, and there is a
strong suggestion of <q> a cut off the joint</q> in the other
meals. Much the same may be said of the Normandie,
and if the Continental is not so popular as the Grand,
it is because it is at the wrong end of the Avenue de
l'Opera.  I have been told by daring tourists that
there are good hostelries on the other side of the
Seine. I cannot speak from experience, but if all I
hear is true, in the Quartier St. Germain there may
still be found representatives of the old <foreign lang="FR">noblesse</foreign> who,
having no houses in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, still put up at the ancient
inns devoted to their class. Here you will find marquises who do not owe their coronets to chocolate
manufactories, and peers of France who can trace their
titles beyond the days of <persName key="Napoleon I.">Napoleon I.</persName></p></div2>

       <div2 n="A NIGHT WITH THE ELECTRIC LIGHT" type="subchapter" id="s218"><head>A NIGHT WITH THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.</head>
  <p>And speaking of hotels, I am reminded that it is
well to discover the secrets of the electric light before
retiring to rest. A friend of mine, weary from much
travel, went to bed leaving the lamp in full blast. At
4 a.m. he woke up, and finding the electric light still
brilliant, attempted to turn it off.  He pushed the

<pb id="p.328" n="328"/>


button at his side without any effect. He repeated
the pressure several times, and then heard a knock at
his door and the sleepy sounds of a human voice.
He was asked what he wanted, and then discovered
to his surprise, that he had been taking infinite trouble
to summon a superfluous waiter! At the Louvre and
many other hotels there is an indiarubber bag attached
by a tube to the electric lights. You squeeze this bag
once, and the chandelier in the centre of the room
blazes, a second pressure transfers the light from the
centre of the room to the bedside, and a third application puts lights out. The matter is very simple
when you know how it is done; but, if you don't, you
may imitate the action of my friend and bring forth
the early waiter-with results. When you do you had
better look out in your conversation book <q> Dialogue
with a would-be murderer,</q> for you will need some of
the replies! If you are a theatre-goer, you will find
most of the old playhouses occupied by, in fact, old
plays; and if you prefer a music-hall, you will see
most of the stars from the mother country once again.
If you are an artist, you will know your Louvre and
your Luxembourg by heart. If you are a musician,
you will find the Opera and Opera Comique scarcely
up to the mark of <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>. And yet, after all,
<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> is delightful. You don't want to go anywhere
or to do anything. The change of scene should be
enough for you.</p></div2>

       <div2 n="FROM ST. PAUL'S TO WHITSTABLE" type="subchapter" id="s220"><head>FROM ST. PAUL'S TO WHITSTABLE.</head>

  <p>I will assume, for the sake of argument, that my
genial and ever courteous friend, Dr. Farren Farce,
has given me a <q> thorough overhauling,</q> and is looking at me through his confidence-inspiring spectacles.</p>
  <p><q>You want change of air, pleasant companions,
and a wholesome diet.</q> I will suppose my esteemed
medical adviser is observing, <q> See that you get them,
dear friend, or I will not answer for the consequences.</q></p>
  <p>After such an (imaginary) decision I have of
course only to obey (supposititious) orders. I am
living in London, and if I have to obtain change of

<pb id="p.330" n="330"/>


air, why not go to Whitstable? I am to indulge in
a wholesome diet; why not eat oysters? I am to
seek pleasant companions; why not leave myself
in the safe hands of a valued friend of mine I will
call Trevelyan ?</p>
  <p>The matter is soon arranged. We (our party is
to consist of five) are to leave St. Paul's by the
excellent train starting shortly after ten, and reaching
Whitstable at about noon. There are faster conveyances than this on the same well-managed line
of the S. E. and C. D., but this particular <q> fixture</q>
suits all our conveniences. It is neither too early
nor too late: just the proper moment for starting
and arriving. We are not disturbed at our breakfast, and can get to Whitstable just in time for
lunch. On our journey down we talk music and
the drama, social topics, and law and police.  We
note the extensive alterations at Bisley, the
site-changing castle at Rochester (which first appears on
our right, then on our left, and ultimately gets behind
us), and the deserted hop-gardens of Kent.  The
day is delightful. Blue sky and warm sun, with just
a tinge of sharpness in the air telling of the approaching autumn. The run down to the coast takes less
than no time, and we have scarcely leisure for a
game of penny nap before we have reached Whitstable.
  Our host is on the platform ready to offer us a

<pb id="p.331" n="331"/>





hearty greeting. We quickly detrain, and are soon
in the cosy little chaises that seem to be as much
natives of the place as the oysters themselves. We
rattle through the old-fashioned little town, passing
the <q> Bear and Key,</q> and quickly reach the Steam
Packet Hotel.</p>
  <p><q>What are you looking for? </q> asks our host
good-naturedly, as he notices that I am searching for
something or other.</p>
  <p><q>The representative of the General Steam Navigation Company,</q> I reply. <q>Does the boat go to
Margate or Ramsgate, or has it stopped running for
the season ?</q></p>
  <p><q> Oh, we have no steamer now,</q> returns my friend.
<q>There used to be a packet that plied between
Whitstable and Gravesend, but that was years ago.
But we still have a hoy, and in the summer there
are worse journeys in the world than a sail from
Bishopsgate to within sight of Herne Bay. The
hoy makes the trip to London once a week, starts
on a Wednesday, and returns on a Sunday.</q></p>
  <p>And then we make our first acquaintance with
the oysters.</p></div2>

       <div2 n="A RECOLLECTION OF THE DOCKS" type="subchapter" id="s221"><head>A RECOLLECTION OF THE DOCKS.</head>

  <p>We have entered a large shed, half of which is
occupied by tanks.   These receptacles are filling
with water supplied by the rising tide.</p>

<pb id="p.332" n="332"/>



  <p><q>This is our waiting-room,</q>says our host; <q>here
come all the oysters after they have been brought to
the shore by the dredgers, and they are ready for
transmission to London.</q></p>
  <p>And as I look down into the depths of the tanks
I am reminded of the temporary resting-place of
the turtles in a noted <q>tavern</q> in the City where
<q>green fat</q> and <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> are the <foreign lang="FR">specialites de la
maison</foreign>.</p>
  <p><q>The last time I went there,</q> I tell my friends
as we walk across the rails on our way to a small
boat on the shingly shore, <q>I had been with a
tasting order to the docks. We had been a pleasant
party-several of the staff of a well-known 'high-class
weekly'-and we none of us had felt the
influence of the fumes-bearing air of the docks in
the least. One of us on his return to the editor
called attention to this interesting fact-that in spite
of tasting several kinds of sherry and port, and
lunching subsequently on turtle, cold roast beef and
champagne, he was as right as right could be. The
consumption and inhaling of a certain, or rather
uncertain amount of alcohol had not affected him
in the least.</q></p>
  <p><q>And what did the editor say ? </q></p>
  <p><q>Well,</q> I reply, <q> our chief took rather a different
view of our colleague's condition, and expressed
his opinion that <soCalled>he was as tipsy as a fly.</soCalled>  But

<pb id="p.333" n="333"/>



then the editor had not been able to join our
party, so we put down his estimate of our friend's
mental and physical stability to 'nasty jealousy.'
Moreover, as the conductor of a 'high-class weekly,'
he was bound to adopt a gloomy view of life and
its pleasures.</q></p>
  <p>And by this time we have reached the shore and
entered the boat that is to take us to the dredger in
the offing.</p></div2>


       <div2 n="A RECOLLECTION OF THE DOCKS" type="subchapter" id="s222"><head>OYSTERS IN CHARMING VARIETY.</head>

  <p>I frankly confess that I am more of a landsman
than a sailor, so when I see a large cutter making
for us and apparently desirous of running us down
I am rather alarmed. However, there is really no
cause for fear, for the coming vessel is to be our
home for the next four hours; it is making for us
because it wishes to take us aboard. We clamber
up the sides of our new boat, and start for the
oyster-beds.</p>
  <p>And now that we are really on the ocean I begin
to realise the pleasures of the situation. Our boat,
although rough and unornamental, is scrupulously
clean. We are seated on comfortable deck-chairs
and watching lazily the preparations for luncheon.
A cloth as white as snow is spread before us, and
two of the crew are busily cutting slices of brown

<pb id="p.334" n="334"/>



bread and butter and opening bottles of stout and
sauterne.</p>
  <p><q>Do you ever use steam power?</q> I ask as we pass
a perfect fleet of vessels like our own.</p>
  <p><q>No,</q> says our host; <q>it would not be possible.
You see we move sideways. The wind takes us
forward, and we are held back by the dredges. We
cover a considerable amount of submerged ground.
Had we steam the dredges would be pulled along
in single file instead of extended order, as they say
in the service.</q></p>
  <p>As a captain of militia (the solitary distinction
of which I am really proud) I understand my host's
meaning and explain the matter to my companions.</p>
  <p>And now we have our first taste of the treasures
of the vasty deep. One of the dredges has been
drawn up and its shears-like nets opened.  Out
tumble a number of oysters with two or three five-fingers
and a few cockles. The brown bread and
butter, the sauterne, and last but not least, a plate
of <q>seconds</q> are handed round.</p>
  <p><q>Delicious!</q> I exclaim, as I devour a bivalve with
gusto, <q>delicious!</q></p>
  <p>I notice that my friend Trevelyan is like Brer
Rabbit, <q>saying nothing and lying low.</q> But the
others are eating with the same satisfaction that I
am displaying myself. I am rather horrified when

<pb id="p.335" n="335"/>



one of the crew, finding that there are three or four
oysters over, throws them into the sea.</p>
 <p><q>Oh, what waste!</q> I exclaim.</p>
  <p><q> There are plenty more where those come from,</q>
replies our host with a smile. <q> Now, these are worth,
at the sea shore, about fifteen pence a dozen. In
London, however, they are half-a-crown a dozen,
or (when mixed with a few natives) four-and-six.</q></p>
  <p><q> Can you not do without the middleman?</q> I
ask, struck with the enormous difference between
the wholesale price and the retail price.</p>
  <p><q> It has often been suggested and no doubt some
day will come to pass.</q></p>
  <p>And now I understand why Brer Rabbit Trevelyan
has been <q>lying low and saying nothing.</q>  Fresh
oysters have been brought on board and opened.
If the first were delicious, these are supremely delightful. They have a magnificent flavour.</p>
  <p><q>Yes,</q> says our host, <q>you are now tasting
genuine Whitstable natives.  We call these, in
honour of our dear and beautiful Danish lady (that
was the title we gave her more than twenty years
ago, and she still deserves it), the Princess of Wales.</q></p>
  <p>We loyally devour a couple of dozen apiece.
Then we pass over another part of the beds, and
fresh oysters are produced. They are larger than
the others, but of the same splendid flavour.</p>
  <p><q> These have been ten years in their shells,</q> explains


<pb id="p.336" n="336"/>



our host, <q>and are not to be got except by
favour. They are not to be bought-they are not
in the market.</q></p>
  <p>As I dispose of two or three splendid specimens,
I understand more and more clearly why Brer Rabbit
Trevelyan had refused to have anything to do with
<q> seconds.</q></p></div2>


  <div2 n="ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF BIVALVES" type="subchapter" id="s223"><head>ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF BIVALVES.</head>

  <p>We had started at noon, and now the hands of
our watches are nearing four. We are miles and
miles away from the shore, and can see on our
right the town of Herne Bay and a distant view of
the Reculvers. In our rear is Whitstable, with its
shipbuilding yards and miniature residential castle.
Our keen sea-air-created appetites are beginning to
be appeased. It is the time for conversation.</p>
  <p><q> Those last oysters were ten years in their shells,</q>
I surmise.  <q>Dear me!    How long does it take
before an oyster reaches maturity-is sufficiently
grown to be eaten ? </q></p>
  <p><q>From four to five years,</q> replies our host.</p>
<p><q> There are three stages. The first is the appearance of the oyster about the size of a pin's head,
then he grows slightly bigger and is the size of a
small pea, then he gets to the dimensions of a
farthing. He has then to be picked off the native

<pb id="p.337" n="337"/>





shell and thrown back into the sea to grow up on his
own account.</q></p>
  <p><q>Are there good and bad years for oysters ?</q></p>
  <p><q>Why, certainly. An expert can almost tell an
oyster's age from the flavour, as a connoisseur knows
a wine's vintage by the bouquet. There have been
only three grand years during the present century-
one in the twenties, one in <date value="1848">1848</date>, and one in <date value="1893">1893</date>.
The year <date value="1899">1899</date> is also memorable.</q></p>
  <p>I am comforted at this piece of intelligence, considering the sinister rumours that have recently been
flying about.</p>
  <p><q> Did the oysters like the dry and fine weather
of the past summer? </q></p>
  <p><q>They revelled in it. They have to be looked
after carefully. Some oysters cannot stand the cold,
so we take them up by the million and carry them
south. We have winter quarters for them off Portsmouth. Then when they are stronger we fetch them
back and put them in their other beds at Whitstable.</q></p>
 <p><q>Do you feed them?</q></p>
  <p><q> Certainly not; they feed themselves. But there
is something peculiar about the waters in these parts.
We import large numbers of foreigners and lay them
down. But whatever be their nationality on their
arrival they soon adopt the flavour of the true Whitstable native. And in this connection let me advise
you never to try to feed an oyster. Some people

<pb id="p.338" n="338"/>



put bran into the water. A big mistake. Keep a
wet cloth at the top of the barrel and drain them
daily.</q></p>
  <p>Then we pass a boat that seems to be at the
farthest end of the oyster beds.</p>
  <p><q> Our police,</q> says our host. <q>The crew come to
shore once a week to get provisions. The rest of
the time they are on the look-out for trespassers.
A number of unscrupulous luggers have to be
warned off.   As you know, our oyster-beds are
strictly preserved.</q></p>
  <p>And now the sun is setting, and we are going home.
We hear anecdotes about the five-fingers-how these
pests of the ocean cling round oysters and clean them
out. The process takes years to accomplish, but
they manage the feat at last.</p>
  <p><q>We get tons of five-fingers. We sell them for
manure,</q> says our host, who has been showing us
the suckers of these <foreign lang="LA">octopi</foreign> in miniature. In calling
them octopi I beg to be allowed to forget my Latin,
and the number of the creatures' feet.</p>
 <p> We talk oyster-shop as we drift along until one
of us asks if Wright, the low comedian, did not die
at Herne Bay ?</p>
  <p><q>No,</q> returns another of us, who is better informed; <q>you are thinking of Margate. The poor fellow lost his wits before his life-he died hopelessly insane.</q></p></div2>

<div2 n="A MEMORY OF WRIGHT, THE LOW COMEDIAN" type="subchapter" id="s224"><head>A MEMORY OF WRIGHT, THE LOW COMEDIAN.</head>

  <p>I tell my friends that I can just remember Wright
when Paul Bedford was his foil and <q> partner.</q> When
Wright disappeared and my friend Mr. J. L. Toole
took his place, Paul Bedford acted in a similar
capacity to the new low comedian.</p>
  <p><q>Wright and Paul Bedford had a good time of it
in the <hi rend="italics">Green Bushes</hi>,</q> I observe, <q>when it was produced at the old Adelphi. Madame Celeste was of
course the heroine, and Miss Woolgar, subsequently
Mrs. Alfred Mellon, the Irish girl, and Billington (I
think) O'Connor. But I know nothing of the rest of
the cast. It was written, of course, by John Baldwin
Buckstone.</q></p>
  <p><q>Yes,</q> says one of us, <q>he was stock author at
the Adelphi when you were a boy. But later on
he shared the honours of the proud position with
Charles Selby, who wrote <hi rend="italics">The Poor Strollers</hi>, in
which Webster, Billington, Wright, Madame Celeste,
and he himself appeared. That was the play in
which poor Wright told Billington after a long and
noble tirade to be less energetic in his gestures, as
his cheap coat was not made with a view to standing
the storm and stress of emotional oratory! </q></p>
  <p>And with pleasant recollections of the past and

<pb id="p.340" n="340"/>




genial chat about things in general and nothing in
particular we reach the shore.</p></div2>

       <div2 n="THE WAY THE THING IS DONE" type="subchapter" id="s225"><head><q>THE WAY THE THING IS DONE.</q></head>

  <p>I recall the pleasantest of pleasant little dinners
in which our host and his amiable family take a
prominent part.  Then comes the journey home,
enlivened by a game of skill in which an intimate
knowledge of spelling is assumed. And then later
still the train reaches the Victoria Station, and we
prepare to part.</p>
  <p><q> If any of your medical friends were to see you
now,</q> says one of us, as we clasp hands, <q>they would
declare that you look 50 per cent. better than you
did this morning.</q></p>
  <p>Quite true, I did look better. Nay, more, I felt
better. So I would counsel all Londoners to follow
my example.    Go to Whitstable at the earliest
opportunity, and spend the whole day on a boat
eating the choicest oysters. You will find the experience absolutely delightful. And so easy to carry
out! All that is requisite is the necessary invitation!</p></div2>

<p>AFTER the House is up for the summer recess the
platforms of the various London termini are crowded
with young gentlemen in high silk hats and Eton
jackets. These <q>fathers of the coming men</q> are
usually in the best of spirits, as they are returning
home for the holidays. If they are met by mothers
and sisters they are not above bestowing embraces
upon their near relatives, but if they happen to be
travelling <foreign lang="FR">en garcon</foreign> their dignity is tremendous.
They give directions to the porters and cabmen
with perfect <foreign lang="FR">sangfroid</foreign>, and emphasise their commands with the most munificent tips. They know
that the time for garnering pocket money has passed,
and that at home they will find coffers open for the
replenishment of empty purses. So the boys depart
for their parents' houses amidst the smiles and blessings of sympathetic railway officials and the town


<pb id="p.342" n="342"/>



bred jehus.  But before reaching the platforms
most of these lads have been either taking part in
or assisting at entertainments of a more or less
dramatic character.  During the past week the
collegians of Stoneyhurst have been performing an
operetta, those of Edgbaston a Latin play, and
those of St. Augustine's a drama in three acts. Only
the other day Harrow had its Speech Day, when
limitless amusement was afforded by the croaking
of frogs in full evening dress; and Eton commemorated George the Third's birthday with the
usual procession of boats and selection of recitations.

   <div2 n="AMATEUR ACTING AT THE UNIVERSITIES" type="subchapter" id="s227"><head>AMATEUR ACTING AT THE UNIVERSITIES.</head>

   <p>I am afraid that I may get into trouble if I suggest
that the far-famed <q>A.D.C.</q> at Cambridge can be
counted in the number of juvenile histrionics. I am
not forgetful of that capital cut in <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi>, by the late
Charles Keene, which told us that Oxford and Cambridge <q>men</q> considered the Eton and Harrow
cricket match as <q>the inter-University contest in
miniature.</q> Still the <q> A.D.C.</q> in my mind, and very
likely in the minds of many others, is primarily
connected with the school rather than the University.</p>

<pb id="p.343" n="343"/>



<p>Mr. F. C. Burnand, its founder, had been immensely
fond of theatricals when at Eton, and I believe while
at that historical seat of learning managed to get a
farce played at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. The
renowned editor of <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> was the first member to
write an original piece for presentation at the
<q>A.D.C.,</q> as another contributor to the <hi rend="italics">London
Charivari</hi>, Mr. R. C. Lehmann, has been the last.
Only a short while ago <q> Jupiter, LL.D.</q> was
delighting Town and Gown at Cambridge to the great
satisfaction of the Cantabs in general and resident
dons in particular. Those who have not read Mr.
Burnand's <q>Recollections of the Cambridge A.D.C.</q>
should get the book at once and study it.  The
volume is full of amusing stories, and serves as a
record of the members of the famous society to the
date of publication. The history of the <q>A.D.C.</q>
is traced from the early days when Mr. Burnand
thought of calling the late Mr. Maddison Morton's
celebrated farce Box <foreign lang="GREEK">Kai</foreign> Cox (to give it a Greek
flavour for the readier acceptance of the Vice Chancellor) to the time when H.R.H. the Prince of Wales
was present at the club's jubilee. It would be a
good thing if the eminent author would consent to
issue a new edition of his admirable work, bringing
his <q> Recollections </q> up to date. Much has happened
since the days when <q> Charlie Hall</q> was the best
of stage managers, and <q> C. R. Carrington </q> the most

<pb id="p.344" n="344"/>



amusing of burlesquers. Only the other day I saw
these talented members of the best of clubs standing
in front of their president at the state opening of
the Tower Bridge. One of the two was Recorder
of London, and the other Lord Chamberlain. But
the A.D.C. has not only been a stepping-stone to
the Bench and the Senate, but also to the run of
the professional boards. A glance at the theatrical
programmes a few weeks before the London dramatic
season had come to an abrupt conclusion would have
revealed a number of names well known on the banks
of the Cam. To select a couple out of a dozen, I
may mention Messrs. Brookfield and Elliott. Oxford
has not been quite so famous in histrionics as the
sister university. For some time there was a club
called <q>The Shooting Stars,</q> but it ultimately
vanished (like its namesakes) into space. However,
recently, thanks amongst other causes to the efforts
of Mr. Henry Irving the younger, the Oxford Amateur
Dramatic Club has obtained considerable popularity.
But it will take a long while before any society
attains the success of the A.D.C.   <q> Burnand's
Creation</q> was never more prosperous.   May its
future be as pleasant as its present and its past.</p></div2>

<div2 n="THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE POWERS THAT ARE" type="subchapter" id="s228"><head>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE POWERS THAT ARE.</head>
  <p>To come to the entertainments of a scholastic
<q>breaking up.</q> The powers that are have a very

<pb id="p.345" n="345"/>




heavy responsibility. They should realise that in
their hands are at least three hours of valuable time.
A father must be very hard-hearted if he refuses
(without really valid excuse) to be present at the
performances of one of his own sons. Paterfamilias
gets an earnest request from Primus or Secundus,
or possibly Tertius, begging him to assist at his
<q>breaking up.</q> Materfamilias has not only already
consented but settled the costume she proposes to
wear on the auspicious occasion. The female influence (filially instigated) is exercised, and Paterfamilias determines to run down. This often occurs,
and consequently the powers that are have at their
mercy a number of anxious and busy men. They
should treat these men kindly.  They should do
their best to make the entertainment for those men
as little tedious as possible. It is their duty.</p>
  <p>I speak feelingly, for I have myself been at times
induced to assist at <q>breaking-ups.</q> Not very long
ago I was persuaded to travel over a hundred miles
to be present at an amateur performance in which
a young hopeful in whom I take the deepest possible
interest sustained a part. I arrived rather late, and
was met at the door of the temporary theatre by
my juvenile entertainer in full costume.</p>
  <p><q>What! are you not wanted on the stage?</q> I
asked.</p>

<pb id="p.346" n="346"/>



  <p><q>Oh dear no, not for hours. I don't appear until
the second act.</q></p>
  <p><q>And what do you do then? </q></p>
  <p><q>I appear as a waiter.</q></p>
  <p><q>Have you much to say?</q> I queried.</p>
  <p><q>Well, no,</q> was the reply. <q>Not much, at least
not very much. I answer <quote>'Yes, sir,'</quote> twice, and then
go out! </q></p>
  <p>And I had made the journey to see this! However, it is only just to add that the waiter, when
played, was quite a success. Nothing could have
been better than the <q> go out.</q>
</p></div2>

   <div2 n="THE NECESSITY OF CAREFUL REHEARSAL" type="subchapter" id="s229"><head>THE NECESSITY OF CAREFUL REHEARSAL.</head>

   <p>And the attention I expended upon watching the
progress of this small part made me consider the
question of rehearsals in general and rehearsals of
school theatricals in particular. It is some years
since I rehearsed a piece of my own, and possibly
matters may have mended of late. But in the fairly
far away <q>long ago,</q> actors and actresses having
"got their words and their crossings," allowed
matters to drift until the hour of performance. It
was assumed that <q>everything would be right at
night.</q>  The result of this system was this-the
premier, when the Press and the critical public were
present, became nothing more nor less than a dress

<pb id="p.347" n="347"/>





rehearsal. Naturally, a new piece was heavily handicapped by the unpreparedness of all concerned.
Until about the fourth representation it was imperfectly  performed.  These  things are better
managed in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>. On the Continent a play is most
carefully rehearsed.  All the actors and actresses
(principals included) play at rehearsal exactly as
they intend to play at night. As related when
Charles Mathews took <hi rend="italics">Cool as a Cucumber</hi> to
the French capital in the translated form of <hi rend="italics">L'Anglais
Timide</hi>, he was surprised to find that a rehearsal
was played with as much care as a public representation. As I have said the French were equally
astonished to see the great comedian walking
through his part as if he had just received his
scrip and had never seen his companions before.
However, in the case of Charles Mathews the
younger it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> all right at night.  But the fact
should not be accepted as the foundation for a precedent by amateurs.</p></div2>

         <div2 n="DR. LIDDEL AT WESTMINSTER" type="subchapter" id="s230"><head>DR. LIDDEL AT <placeName key="Westminster">WESTMINSTER</placeName>.</head>

  <p>When Dr. Liddel was headmaster at St. Peter's
College he was in the habit of superintending the
rehearsals of the Westminster Play. A story is told
against him that when one of his pupils had to
simulate intoxication, he proposed that the amateur
should <q> suggest drunkenness without losing dignity.</q></p>

<pb id="p.348" n="348"/>



   <p><q>You are a Roman,</q> Dr. Liddel is reported to
have observed, <q>and a Roman never forgets his
position, even when enslaved by the too potent
contents of the wine cup.</q></p>
  <p>In those distant days there used, I believe, to be a
beverage called <q>dog's nose</q> behind the scenes at
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and the would-be reveller drank deeply
-too deeply-of this stimulant to keep up his
courage. As a consequence, when he appeared in
the drunken scene the performance was remarkably
realistic, but scarcely redolent of <q>classical dignity.</q>
So the story goes.  No doubt the tale properly
belongs to the collection of Benjamin Trovato.</p>
 <p> An amateur actor, who still adorns the boards-
but now on rare occasions-was accustomed to take
his directions from Dr. Liddel with adequate respect,
and then play his part at night after the model of
the late Mr. Wright and the present Mr. Toole.
My friend the waiter the other day gave a particularly
original rendering of his part.</p>
  <p><q> Did you do <hi rend="italics">that</hi> at rehearsal?</q> I asked, referring
to one of his <q>points.</q></p>
  <p><quote> " Oh, dear no," </quote>was the reply, <q>I kept it for the
performance.</q></p>
   <p>It was rather a dangerous expedient, but on the
occasion to which I refer success attended the experiment. It was one of those rare instances where
the end justified the means.</p></div2>

               <div2 n="FOR THE DEFENCE" type="subchapter" id="s231"><head>FOR THE DEFENCE.</head>

  <p>A school entertainment should not be too long. If
the boys must recite, let them confine themselves to
less than a hundred lines. If a piece is selected for
performance, a farce in a single scene is frequently
more effective than a comedy in five acts. Costume
plays are better than dramas of the day. A lad
feels less shy if he is <q>dressed up,</q> and it is easier
to accept feeble acting if it is supposed to suggest
the manners and customs of the <q>long ago.</q> If a
play has no female characters so much the better,
as, in spite of classical precedents, a lad appearing
as a lady is never entirely satisfactory. And in this
connection I may observe that pieces have been
written with a view to excluding the softer (or should
I say harder?) sex. It is better for the powers that
are to secure such a play rather than to trust to their
editing of <q>Hamlet</q> with a view to the exclusion
of Gertrude and Ophelia.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, perhaps the best reason for the
continuance of school representations may be found
in the following dialogue, which took place between
myself and my young friend only a day or so ago:-</p>
 <p> <q>Did you enjoy yourself in front? </q> asked the lad.</p>
 <p><q>Oh, immensely.</q></p>
  <p><q>And so did we behind the curtain. I wouldn't

<pb id="p.350" n="350"/>



have missed it for worlds. And I am so glad you
saw it.</q></p>
  <p>And in this assurance I found ample compensation
for disturbance.</p>
  <p>Let me hope that my readers, lured away from
more serious matters by my <q>gossip,</q> will be able
to say the like of my Sketches of London at the End
of the Century.</p>
