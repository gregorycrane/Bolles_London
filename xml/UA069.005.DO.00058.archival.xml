<div1 type="preface" n="Preface" id="front003"><head>Preface.</head>

<p>Long ago, when I was a boy at a private tutors near Edmonton, the only book in which I could find any interest or amusement in the scanty library of the house was Charles Knight's <title>London,</title> and the pleasure derived from it led to my spending every sixpence I could save, and every holiday on which I could get leave, in seeing some of the places it described. </p>
<p>London is much changed since that time; but the solitary expeditions I then made through its historic sights, so inexpressibly delightful at the time, laid a foundation for the work of the last <num value="2">two</num> years, of which these volumes are the result.. They aim at nothing original, indeed any <num value="1">one</num> who attempts a work of the kind must, to borrow the language of the author of <title>Eothen,</title> be <quote>subjected to the immutable law which compels a man with a pen in his hand to be uttering now and then some sentiment not his own, as though, like the French peasant under the old <foreign lang="FR">r&#x00E9;gime</foreign>, he were bound to perform a certain amount of work on the public highways.</quote> But, when I was wishing to know something about London <pb id="p.viii" n="viii"/> myself, in spite of the multiplicity of works upon the subject, I felt the want of having things brought together in the order in which they occur, of <num value="1">one</num> recollection being interlaced with another in a way which might help me to remember it, and this is what I have tried to do for others.</p>
<p>In these <num value="2">two</num> volumes I believe that all the objects of interest in London are described consecutively, as they may be visited in excursions, taking <placeName key="bart,Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> as a centre.  The <num value="1">first</num> volume is chiefly devoted to the City, the <num value="2">second</num> to the West End and <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</p>
<p>I have followed the plan adopted in my books on Italy, of introducing quotations from other and better authors, where they apply to my subject; and, while endeavouring to make <title>Walks in London</title> something more interesting than a Guide-book, I have tried, especially in <placeName key="cruch,Westminster abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName> and the Picture Galleries, to give such details as may suggest new lines of inquiry to those who care to linger and investigate.</p>
<p>The Histories of London, and the Histories of especial points connected with London, are too numerous to mention. They are all to be found in the admirable Library at the <placeName key="cruch,Guildhall">Guildhall</placeName>, which is the greatest advantage to a local antiquarian, and leaves little to be desired except a better Catalogue. Of the various works by which I have benefited in my own rambles through London, I should mention with marked gratitude the many volumes of Mr. John Timbs, especially his <title>Curiosities of London,</title> enriched by <title><num value="60">Sixty</num> Years' Personal Recollections,</title> and the admirable articles <pb id="p.ix" n="ix"/> on the old houses and churches of London which, for many years, have from time to time appeared in <title>The Builder.</title>
</p>
 <p>Some of the chapters in <title>Walks in London </title> have been already published, in a condensed form, in <title>Good Words</title>
for <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>. The illustrations, with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> exceptions, are from my own sketches taken on the spot, and carefully transferred to wood by the skill of Mr. T. Sulman.</p>
   <p>I shall gladly and gratefully receive any corrections of errors found in my work by those who follow in my footsteps.</p>

 <div1 type="abstract" n="Introductory" id="front004"><head>Introductory.</head>   <p> <quote>Sir, the happiness of London is not to be conceived but by those who have been in it. I will venture to say there is more learning and science within the circumference of <num value="10">ten</num> miles from where we sit than in all the rest of the kingdom.</quote> Such was the dictum of Dr. Johnson when he was seated with Boswell in the Mitre Tavern near <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName>, and how many thousands of people before and since have felt the same cat-like attachment as the old philosopher to the vast town of multitudinous life and ever-changing aspects?   As Cowper says-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Where has Pleasure such a field,</l>
<l>So rich, so thronged, so drained, so well supplied,</l>
<l>As London-opulent, enlarged, and still</l>
<l>Increasing London.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Macaulay had the reputation of having walked through every street in London, but if we consider the ever-growing size of the town we cannot believe that anyone else will ever do so: for more people live in London already than in the whole of Denmark or Switzerland, more than twice as many as in Saxony or Norway, and nearly as many as in  Scotland. And, if we trust to old prophecies. London has <pb id="p.xiii" n="xiii"/> still to be doubled in circumference, for Mother Shipton says that the day will come when Highgate Hill shall be in the middle of the town. Few indeed are the Londoners who see more than a small circuit around their homes, the main arteries of mercantile life, and some of the principal sights. It is very easy to live with eyes open, but it is more usual, and a great deal more fashionable, to live with eyes shut. Scarcely any man in what is usually called <quote>society</quote> has the slightest idea of what there is to be seen in his own great metropolis, because he never looks, or still more perhaps, because he never inquires, and the architectural and historical treasures of the City are almost as unknown to the West End as the buried cities of Bashan or the lost tombs of Etruria. Strangers also, especially foreigners, who come perhaps with the very object of seeing London, are inclined to judge it by its general aspects, and do not stay long enough to find out its more hidden resources. They never find out that the London of <placeName key="bart,Brook Street">Brook Street</placeName> and <placeName key="bart,Grosvenor Street">Grosvenor Street</placeName>, still more the odious London of Tyburnia, Belgravia, and South Kensington, is as different to the London of our great-grandfathers as modernised Paris is to the oldest town in Brittany, and dwellers in the West End do not know that they might experience almost the refreshment and tonic of going abroad in the transition from straight streets and featureless houses to the crooked thoroughfares half-an-hour off, where every street has a reminiscence, and every turn is a picture.   There is a passage in Heinrich Heine which says, <quote>You may send a philosopher to London, but by no means a poet.   The bare earnestness of everything, the colossal sameness, the machine-like movement, oppresses the imagination and <pb id="p.xv" n="xv"/> rends the heart in twain.</quote> But those who know London well will think that Heine must have stayed at an hotel in <placeName key="cruch,Wimpole street">Wimpole Street</placeName>, and that his researches can never have taken him much beyond <placeName key="bart,Oxford Street">Oxford Street</placeName> and its surroundings; and that a poet might find plenty of inspiration, if he would do what is so easy, and break the ice of custom, and see London as it really is--in its strange varieties of society, in its lights and shadows of working life, in its endless old buildings which must ever have a hold on the inmost sympathies of those who look upon them, and who, while learning the story they tell of many generations, seem to realise that they are <quote>in the presence of their fame and feel their influence.</quote>
</p><p>An artist, after a time, will find London more interesting than any other place, for nowhere are there such atmospheric effects on fine days, and nowhere is the enormous power of blue more felt in the picture; while the soot, which puts all the stones into mourning, makes everything look old. The detractors of the charms of London always lay their strongest emphasis upon its fogs-</p>
 <p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>More like a distillation of mud than anything else; the ghost of mud,--the spiritualised medium of departed mud, through which the dead citizens of London probably tread, in the Hades whither they are translated.</quote><bibl>-Hawthorne. <title>Note-books</title>.</bibl></cit></quote>
But if the fogs are not too thick an artist will find an additional charm in them, and will remember with pleasure the beautiful effects upon the river, when only the grand features remain, and the ignominious details are blotted out; or when <quote>the eternal mist around <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName> is turned to a glittering haze.</quote> In fact, if the capitals of Europe are considered, London is <num value="1">one</num> of the most picturesque--far <pb id="p.xvi" n="xvi"/> more so than Paris or Vienna; incomparably more so than St. Petersburg, Berlin, Dresden, Munich, Brussels, or Madrid.</p>
<p>No town in Europe is better supplied with greenery than London: even in the City almost every street has its tree. And pity often is ill bestowed upon Londoners by dwellers in the country, for the fact is all the best attributes of the country are to be found in the town. The squares of the West End, with their high railings, and ill-kept gardens, are certainly ugly enough, but the parks are full of beauty, and there are walks in Kensington Gardens which in early spring present a maze of loveliness. Lately too, since window gardening has become the fashion, each house has its boxes of radiant flowers, enlivening the dusty stonework or smoke-blackened bricks, and seeming all the more cheerful from their contrast. Through the markets too all that is best in country produce flows into the town: the strawberries, the cherries, the vegetables, are always finer there than at the places where they are grown.   Milton, who changed his house oftener than anyone else, and knew more parts of the metropolis intimately, thus apostrophizes it-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Oh city, founded by Dardanian hands,</l>
<l>Whose towering front the circling realms commands,</l>
<l>Too blest abode! no loveliness we see,</l>
<l>In all the earth, but it abounds in thee.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>There is a certain class of minds, and a large <num value="1">one</num>, which stagnates in the country, and which finds the most luxurious stimulant in the ceaseless variety of London, where there is always so much to be seen and so much to be heard, and these make so much to be thought of. </p><pb id="p.xvii" n="xvii"/>
<p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>I have passed all my days in London, until I have formed as many and as intense local attachments, as any of you mountaineers can have done with dead nature. The lighted shops of <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> and <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>; the innumerable trades, tradesmen, and customers, coaches, waggons, playhouses; all the bustle and wickedness round about Covent Garden; the watchmen, drunken scenes, rattles;--life awake, if you awake, at all hours of the night; the impossibility of being dull in <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>; the crowds, the very dirt and mud, the sun shining upon houses and pavements, the print-shops, the old book-stalls, parsons cheapening books, coffee-houses, steams of soups from kitchens, the pantomimes-London itself a pantomime and a masquerade-all these things work themselves into my mind, and feed me without a power of satiating me. The wonder of these sights impels me into night-walks about her crowded streets, and I often shed tears in the motley Strand from fulness of joy at so much life. ...   I consider the clouds above me but as a roof beautifully painted, but unable to satisfy the mind; and at last, like the pictures of the apartment of a connoisseur, unable to afford him any longer a pleasure. So fading upon me, from disuse, have been the beauties of Nature, as they have been confinedly called; so ever fresh, and green, and warm, are all the inventions of men, and assemblies of men in this great city.</quote><bibl>Charles Lamb to Wordsworth, <dateStruct value="1800-01-30"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg="30">30</day>, <year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>.</bibl></cit></quote></p>

<p>Many derivations are given for the name London. Some derive it from Lhwn-dinas, the <quote>City in the Wood;</quote> others from Llongdinas, the <quote>City of Ships;</quote> others from   Llyndhn, the <quote>Hill Fortress by the Lake.</quote> Geoffrey of Monmouth says that Brute <quote>builded this citie</quote> about A.C. <dateStruct value="1008--"><year reg="1008">1008</year></dateStruct>. From   the   time   at which it is reported   to   have   been founded by Brute, says Brayley, <quote>even fable itself is silent in regard to its history, until the century immediately preceding the Roman invasion.</quote> <note><title>Londiniana</title>.</note>   Then King Lud is said to have encircled it with walls, and adorned it <quote>with fayre buildings and towers.</quote> The remains found certainly prove the existence of a British city on the site before the Londinium, or Colonia Augusta, spoken of by Tacitus and <pb id="p.xviii" n="xviii"/> Ammianus Marcellinus, which must have been founded by the Roman expedition under Aulus Plautius in A.D. <dateStruct value="43"><year reg="43">43</year></dateStruct>. Tacitus mentions that it was already the great <quote>mart of trade and commerce</quote> and the <quote>chief residence of merchants,</quote> when the revolt of the Iceni occurred under Boadicea in A.D. <dateStruct value="61"><year reg="61">61</year></dateStruct>, in which it was laid waste with fire and sword. It had however risen from its ashes in the time of Severus (A.D. <dateStruct value="193"><year reg="193">193</year></dateStruct>-<num value="211">211</num>), when Tacitus describes it as <quote>illustrious for the vast number of merchants who resorted to it, for its extensive commerce, and for the abundance of every kind of commodity which it could supply.</quote> <note><title>Londiniana</title>.</note>
</p>
<p>Stow says that the walls of London were built by Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, <quote>about the year of Christ <num value="306">306</num>,</quote> at any rate there is little doubt that they were erected in the <num value="4">fourth</num> century. They were rather more than <num value="2">two</num> miles in circumference, defended by towers, and marked at the principal points by the great gates, <placeName key="bart,Aldgate">Aldgate</placeName>, Bishopsgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, and Ludgate. The best fragments of the old wall remaining are to be seen opposite Sion College, and in the churchyard of St. Giles, Cripplegate   there is also a fragment in St. <placeName key="cruch,Martin's court">Martin's Court</placeName> on <placeName key="bart,Ludgate Hill">Ludgate Hill</placeName>. Quantities of Roman antiquities, tessellated pavements, urns, vases, &amp;c., have been found from time to time within this circuit, especially in digging the foundations of the Goldsmiths' Hall, and of the Hall of Commerce in <placeName key="bart,Threadneedle Street">Threadneedle Street</placeName>. For a long time these remains were carelessly kept or not kept at all, but latterly some of them have been collected in the admirable little museum under the <placeName key="cruch,Guildhall">Guildhall</placeName>. Several Roman cemeteries have been discovered, <num value="1">one</num> of them by <pb id="p.xix" n="xix"/>  Sir Christopher Wren when he was laying the foundation of the new   <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>.   All the excavations show   that modern London is at least <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet higher than the  London of the Romans, which has been buried by the same inexplicable process which entombed the Roman Forum, and covered many of its temples with earth up to the capitals of the columns.</p>
<p>Very little is known of London in Saxon times except that <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</placeName> was founded by Ethelbert, in A.D. <dateStruct value="610"><year reg="610">610</year></dateStruct>, in the time of King Sebert.   Bede, who mentions this, describes London as an <quote>emporium   of many nations who arrived thither by land and sea.</quote> London was the stronghold of the Danes, but was successfully besieged by Alfred, and Athelstan had a palace here. His successor Ethelred the Unready was driven out again by the Danes under  Sweyn.   On the death of Sweyn, Ethelred returned, and his son Edmund Ironside was the <num value="1">first</num> monarch crowned in the capital.   London grew   greatly in importance under  Edward the Confessor, who built the Palace and Abbey of  <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and it made a resistance to the Conqueror which was for some time effectual, though, on the submission of the clergy, he was presented with the keys of the  City and crowned at the Confessor's tomb. He immediately tried to conciliate the citizens, by granting them the charter, which, written in the Saxon language, on a strip of vellum, is still preserved amongst the City archives.</p>
<p> <quote>William the King greeteth William the Bishop and Godfrey the Portreve, and all the burgesses within London, both French and English. And I declare that I grant you all to be law-worthy as ye were in King Edward's days. And I will that every child be his father's heir after his father's days. And I will not suffer that any man do you wrong. . God preserve you.</quote> <pb id="p.xx" n="xx"/></p>
<p>The chief events in the after story of London, its insurrections, its pageants, its martyrdoms, its conspiracies, its pestilences, its Great Fire, its religious agitations, its political excitements, are all noticed in describing those parts of the town with which they are especially connected.</p>
<p>   Fuller says that London <quote>is the <num value="2">second</num> city in Christendome for greatnesse, and the <num value="1">first</num> for good government.</quote> Its chief officer under the Saxons was called the Portreeve. After the Conquest the French word Maire, from Major, was introduced. We <num value="1">first</num> hear of a <hi rend="italics">Mayor</hi> of London in the reign of Henry II. His necessary qualifications are, that he shall be free of <num value="1">one</num> of the City Companies, have served as Sheriff, and be an Alderman at the time of his election.<note>Londiniana.</note>   The name of <hi rend="italics">Alderman</hi> is derived from the title of a Saxon noble, <hi rend="italics">eald</hi> meaning old, <hi rend="italics">ealder</hi> elder.   It is applied to the chief officer of a ward or guild and each Alderman of London takes his name from a ward. The  <rs type="Subject">City Companies</rs> or Merchant Guilds, though branches of the Corporation, have each a distinct government and peculiar liberties and immunities granted in special charters. Each Company has a Master and other officers, and separate <hi rend="italics">Halls</hi> for their business or banquets. The oldest of the Companies is the Weavers, with a charter of i <num value="164">164</num>. Then come the Parish Clerks, instituted in <dateStruct value="1232--"><year reg="1232">1232</year></dateStruct>, and the Saddlers, in <dateStruct value="1280--"><year reg="1280">1280</year></dateStruct>. The Bakers, Goldsmiths, Skinners, Grocers, Carpenters, and Fishmongers, all date from   the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century. There are <num value="91">ninety-one</num> Companies, but of these <num value="12">twelve</num> are the most important, viz.- </p><pb id="p.xxi" n="xxi"/>

  <p>In the <num value="2">second</num> year of Elizabeth the pictorial map of Ralph Aggas was published, which shows how little in those days London had increased beyond its early boundaries. Outside <placeName key="bart,Aldgate">Aldgate</placeName>, Bishopsgate, and Cripplegate, all was still complete country. <quote>The Spital Fyeld</quote> (Spitalfields) and <quote>Finsburie Fyeld</quote> were archery grounds: <placeName key="bart,Moorfields">Moorfields</placeName> was a marsh. St. Giles, Cripplegate, was the church of a little hamlet beyond the walls. Farther west a few houses in <quote>Little Britanne</quote> and <placeName key="bart,Cock Lane">Cock Lane</placeName> clustered around the open space of <quote>Schmyt Fyeld,</quote> black with the fires of recent martyrdoms. A slender thread of humble dwellings straggled along the road which led by Holbourne Bridge across the Fleet to St. Andrew's Church and Ely Place, but ceased altogether after <quote>Holbourne Hill</quote> till the road reached the desolate village and leper-hospital of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. A wide expanse of open pasture-land, only broken by Drury House and the Convent Garden of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, extended southwards from <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName> to <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName>, where the houses of the great nobles lined the passage of the sovereign from the City to the small royal city and great palace of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. From   <placeName key="bart,Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</placeName> and the <placeName key="bart,Haymarket">Haymarket</placeName> were hedge-girt roads leading into a solitude, and there was scarcely any house westwards except the Hospital of St. James, recently turned into a palace.</p>
<p>After the time of Elizabeth, London began to grow <pb id="p.xxii" n="xxii"/> rapidly, though Elizabeth herself and her immediate successors, dreading the power of such multitudes in the neighbourhood of the Court, did all they could to check it. In <dateStruct value="1580-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1580">1580</year></dateStruct>, all persons were prohibited from building houses within <num value="3">three</num> miles of any of the City gates, and, in <dateStruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></dateStruct>, a proclamation was made for <quote>restraining the increase of buildings,</quote> and the <quote>voyding of inmates</quote> in the cities of London and <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and for <num value="3">three</num> miles round. But in spite of this, in spite of the Plague which destroyed <num value="68596">68,596</num> people, and the Fire which destroyed <num value="13200">13,200</num> houses, the great city continued to grow. Latterly it has increased so rapidly westwards, that it is impossible to define the limits of the town. It has been travelling west more or less ever since the time of the Plantagenets;--from the City to <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName>, and to Canonbury and Clerkenwell; then, under the Stuart kings, to the more northern parts of the parish of St. Clement Danes and to <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>: then, under William III. and Anne, to Bloomsbury and Soho: under the early Georges, to the Portland and Portman estates, then to the Grosvenor estates, and lastly to South Kensington. By its later increase the town has enormously increased the wealth of <num value="9">nine</num> peers, to whom the greater portion of the soil upon which it has been built belongs-i.e. the Dukes of Portland, Bedford, and   <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>; the Marquises   of Exeter, Salisbury, Northampton, and the Marquis Camden; the Earl Craven and Lord Portman. No <num value="1">one</num> can tell where the West End will be next year. It is always moving into the country and never arriving there. Generally Fashion <quote>is only gentility moving away from vulgarity and afraid of being overtaken by it,</quote> but in this case it is also a perpetual flight before the smoke, which still always drives <pb id="p.xxiii" n="xxiii"/> westwards, so that when the atmosphere is thickest in Brompton, the sky is often blue and the air pure in <placeName key="cruch,Ratcliff highway">Ratcliff Highway</placeName>.</p>
<p>In all the changes of generations of men and manners in London, the truth of the proverb, <quote>Birds of a feather flock together,</quote> has been attested by the way in which the members of the same nationalities and those who have followed the same occupations have inhabited the same district.   Thus, French live in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="bart,Leicester Square">Leicester Square</placeName> and Soho, Italians in <placeName key="bart,Hatton Garden">Hatton Garden</placeName>, and Germans in the east of London. Thus, Lawyers live in <placeName key="cruch,Lincoln's inn">Lincoln's Inn</placeName> and the Temple; Surgeons and Dentists in <placeName key="bart,George Street">George Street</placeName> and <placeName key="cruch,Burlington street">Burlington Street</placeName>; Doctors in <placeName key="bart,Harley Street">Harley Street</placeName>; and retired Indians in <placeName key="bart,Cavendish Square">Cavendish Square</placeName> and <placeName key="bart,Portman Square">Portman Square</placeName>, with their adjoining streets, which have obtained the name of Little Bengal.   Thus, too, you would go to look for Booksellers in <placeName key="bart,Paternoster Row">Paternoster Row</placeName>, Clockmakers: in Clerkenwell, Butchers in Newgate and Smithfield, Furniture Dealers in <placeName key="bart,Tottenham Court Road">Tottenham Court Road</placeName>, Hatmakers in <placeName key="cruch,Southwark">Southwark</placeName>, Tanners and Leather-dressers in <placeName key="cruch,Bermondsey">Bermondsey</placeName>, Bird and Bird-cage sellers near the <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials, Statuaries in the <placeName key="bart,Euston Road">Euston Road</placeName>, and Artists at <placeName key="bart,The Boltons">the Boltons</placeName>.</p>
<p>The poorest parts of London also have always been its eastern and north-eastern parishes, and the district about Soho and St. Giles-in-the-Fields. So much has been said and written of the appearance of poverty and crime which these streets present, that those who visit them will be surprised to find at least outward decency and a tolerably thriving population; though of course the words of Cowley are true-</p> <pb id="p.xxiv" n="xxiv"/><p>

</p><p>The great landmarks are the same in London now that they were in the time of the Plantagenets: the Tower is still the great fortress; <placeName key="bart,London Bridge">London Bridge</placeName> is still the great causeway for traffic across the river; <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName> and <placeName key="cruch,Westminster abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName> are still the great churches; and <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Palace is only transferred from the sovereign to the legislature. The City still shows by its hills-Ludgate Hill, <placeName key="bart,Cornhill">Cornhill</placeName>, and Tower Hill-why it was chosen as the early capital.   <num value="1">One</num> feature however of old London is annihilated-all the smaller brooks or rivers which fed the Thames are buried and lost to view. The Eye Bourne, the Old Bourne, and the Wall Brook, though they still burrow beneath the town, seem to have left nothing but their names. Even the Fleet, of which there are so many unflattering descriptions in the poets of the last century, is entirely arched over, and it is difficult to believe that there can ever have been a time when Londoners saw <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> ships at once sailing up to <placeName key="bart,Holborn">Holborn</placeName>Bridge, or still more that they can have gone up as high as Baggnigge Wells Road, where the discovery of an anchor seems to testify to their presence. Where the aspect is entirely changed the former character of London sites is often pleasantly recorded for us in the names of the streets. <quote><placeName key="bart,Hatton Garden">Hatton Garden</placeName>,</quote>  <quote><placeName key="bart,Baldwin's Gardens">Baldwin's Gardens</placeName>,</quote> and <quote><placeName key="bart,Whetstone Park">Whetstone Park</placeName></quote> keep up a reminiscence of the rural nature of a now crowded district as late as the time of the Stuarts, though <pb id="p.xxv" n="xxv"/> with <quote><placeName key="bart,Lincoln's Inn Fields">Lincoln's Inn Fields</placeName>,</quote> and <quote>Great and Little Turnstile,</quote> they have a satirical effect as applied to the places which now belong to them.

<p>Few would re-echo Malcolm's exclamation, <quote>Thank God, old London was burnt,</quote> even if it were quite true, which it is not. The Fire destroyed the greater part of London, but gave so much work to the builders that the small portion unburnt remained comparatively untouched till the tide of fashion had flowed too far westwards to make any systematic rebuilding worth while. It is over the <hi rend="italics">City</hi> of  London, as the oldest part of the town, that its chief interest still hovers. Those who go there in search of its treasures will be stunned on week-days by the tourbillon of its movement, and the constant eddies at all the great crossings in the whirlpool of its business life, such as no other town in Europe can show. But this also has its charms, and no <num value="1">one</num> has seen London properly who has not watched the excited crowds at the Stock Exchange, threaded the labyrinth of the Bank, wondered at the intricate arrangements of the Post Office, attended a Charity Children's service at <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>, beheld the Lord Mayor drive by in his coach; stood amid the wigged lawyers and whirling pigeons of the <placeName key="cruch,Guildhall">Guildhall</placeName>; and struggled through <placeName key="bart,Cheapside">Cheapside</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Cornhill">Cornhill</placeName>, and <placeName key="bart,Great Tower Street">Great Tower Street</placeName> with the full tide of a weekday.</p>
<p>But no <num value="1">one</num> can see the City properly who does not walk in it, and.no <num value="1">one</num> can walk in it comfortably except on a <pb id="p.xxvi" n="xxvi"/> Sunday.   On that day it is thoroughly enjoyable. The great chimneys have ceased smoking, the sky is blue, the trees look green, but that which is most remarkable is, the streets are empty. What becomes of all the people it is impossible to imagine; there are not only no carriages, there are scarcely any foot-passengers: <num value="1">one</num> may saunter along the pavement with no chance of being jostled, and walk down the middle of the street without any fear of being run over. Then alone can the external features of the City be studied, and there is a great charm in the oddity of having it all to <num value="1">one</num>'s self, as well as in the quietude. Then we see how, even in the district which was devastated by the Fire, several important fragments escaped, and how the portion which was unburnt is filled with precious memorials of an earlier time.   Scarcely less interesting also, and, though not always beautiful, of a character exceedingly unusual in England, are the numerous buildings erected immediately after the Fire in the reign of Charles II. The treasures which we have to look for are often very obscure --a sculptured gateway, a panelled room, a storm-beaten tower, or an incised stone-and in themselves might scarcely be worth a tour of inspection; but in a city where so many millions of inhabitants have lived and passed away, where so many great events of the world's history have occurred, there is scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of these long-lived remnants which has not some strange story to tell in which it bears the character of the only existing witness. The surroundings, too, are generally picturesque, and only those who study them and dwell upon them can realise the interest of the desolate tombs in the City churches, the loveliness of the plane-trees in their fresh spring green rising amid the smoky <pb id="p.xxvii" n="xxvii"/> houses in those breathing spaces left by the Fire in the old City churchyards where the churches were never rebuilt, or the soft effects of aerial perspective from the wharfs of the Thames or amid the many-masted shipping in the still reaches of <quote><placeName key="cruch,the Pool">the Pool</placeName>,</quote> where the great White Tower of the Conqueror still frowns at the beautiful church built in honour of a poor ferry-woman,</p><p><num value="17">One hundred and seven</num> churches were destroyed in the Fire, and only <num value="22">twenty-two</num> were preserved. Of these many have since been pulled down, and there are now only <num value="13">thirteen</num> churches in existence which date before the time of Charles II. Those which were built immediately after the Fire; however, are scarcely less interesting, for though Wren had more work than he could possibly attend to properly, he never forgot that the greatest acquirement of architecture is the art of <hi rend="italics">interesting</hi>, and the inexhaustible power of his imagination displayed in his parish churches is not less astonishing than his genius evinced at <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>. He built <num value="53">fifty-three</num> churches in London, mostly classic; in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>, as St. Mary Aldermary and St. Alban, <placeName key="cruch,Wood street">Wood Street</placeName>, he has attempted Gothic, and in these he has failed. Almost all the exteriors depend for ornament upon their towers, which are seldom well seen individually on account of their confined positions, but which are admirable in combination. The best is undoubtedly that of Bow Church; then St. Magnus, St. Bride, St. Vedast, and St. Martin deserve attention. The saints to whom the old City churches are dedicated are generally the old English saints honoured before the Reformation, whose comparative popularity may be gathered from the number of buildings placed under the protection of each. Thus there were <num value="4">four</num> churches <pb id="p.xxviii" n="xxviii"/> dedicated to St. Botolph, <num value="4">four</num> to St. Benet, <num value="3">three</num> to St. Leonard, <num value="3">three</num> to St. Dunstan, and <num value="2">two</num> to St. Giles, while St. Ethelburga, St. Etheldreda, St. Alban, St. Vedast, St. Swithin, St. Edmund, and St. Bridget, had each their single church. <num value="12">Twelve</num> of the City churches have been wantonly destroyed in our own time, and, though perhaps not beautiful in themselves, the thinning of the forest of towers and steeples, which was such a characteristic of ancient London, is greatly to be deplored. The interiors of the churches derive their chief interest from their monuments, but they are also often rich in Renaissance carvings and ironwork. They almost always have high pews, in which those who wish to attend the service may share the feelings of the little girl who, when taken to church for the <num value="1">first</num> time, complained that she had been shut up in a closet, and made to sit upon a shelf.</p>
<p>Interesting specimens of domestic architecture before the Fire are to be found in the neighbourhood of Smithfield, in Aldersgate, Bishopsgate, and their surroundings. Crosby Hall and Sir Paul Pindar's House in the City; the Water Gate of York House; and Holland House in Kensington, are the most remarkable examples which come within the limits of our excursions.</p>
<p>When the new London--arose after the Fire, the persistence of the citizens who jealously clung to their old landmarks caused the configuration of the former city to be observed, to the destruction of the grand designs of renovation proposed by Evelyn and Wren, but to the preservation of many old associations, and the rescuing of much historic interest from oblivion. The domestic buildings which were then erected are no less interesting than the churches, <pb id="p.xxix" n="xxix"/> including as they do many of the noble old Halls of the City Companies, and private houses built by Wren. With the landing of William   III. the Dutch style of regular windows and flat-topped uniform   brick fronts was introduced, which gradually deteriorated from the comfortable quaint houses of Anne's time with the carved wooden porches which may be seen in <placeName key="bart,Queen Anne's Gate">Queen Anne's Gate</placeName>, to the hideous monotony of <placeName key="cruch,Wimpole street">Wimpole Street</placeName> and <placeName key="bart,Baker Street">Baker Street</placeName>. Under the brothers Adam   and their followers there was a brief revival of good taste, and all their works are deserving of study-masterly alike in proportion and in delicacy of detail.   In fact, though the buildings of the British Classical revival were often cold and formal, they were never bad.</p>
<p>Some people maintain that Art is dead in England, others that it lives and grows daily. Certainly street architecture appeared to be in a hopeless condition, featureless, colourless, almost formless, till a few years ago, but, since then, there has been an unexpected resurrection. <placeName key="cruch,Dorchester house">Dorchester House</placeName> is a noble example of the Florentine style, really grandiose and imposing, and the admirable work of Norman Shaw at Lowther Lodge seems to have given an impulse to brick and terra-cotta decoration, which has been capitally followed out in several new houses in <placeName key="bart,Cheapside">Cheapside</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Oxford Street">Oxford Street</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Bond Street">Bond Street</placeName>, and <placeName key="bart,South Audley Street">South Audley Street</placeName>, and which is the beginning of a school of architecture for the reign of Victoria, as distinctive as that of Inigo Jones and Wren was for the time of the Stuarts. The more English architects study   the brick cities of Northern Italy and learn that the best results are brought about by the simplest means, and that the greatest charm of a street <pb id="p.xxx" n="xxx"/> is its irregularity, the more beautiful and picturesque will our London become.</p>
<p>Besides the glorious collection in its <placeName key="cruch,National gallery">National Gallery</placeName>,  London possesses many magnificent pictures in the great houses of its nobles, though few of these are shown to the public with the liberality displayed in continental cities. In the West End, however, people are more worth seeing than pictures, and foreigners and Americans will find endless sources of amusement in Rotten Row--in the Exhibitions-and in a lev&#x00E9;e at St. James's.</p>

<p>The Thames is still the greatest highway in London, formerly it was the only highway; for even the best streets were comparatively mere bye-ways, where the men rode upon horseback, and the ladies were carried in horse litters. It is a proof of the constant use of the river even in the time of Charles II., that Pepys makes a point of mentioning in his <title>Diary</title> whenever he went to a place <hi rend="italics">by land</hi>. The Watermen then used to keep time with their oars to songs, with the chorus-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Heave and how, rumbelow,</l></quote>
 like the gondoliers at Venice. Howell, writing in <dateStruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></dateStruct>, says that the river Thames has not her fellow <quote>if regard be <pb id="p.xxxii" n="xxxii"/> had to those forests of masts that are perpetually upon her; the variety of smaller wooden bottoms playing up and down; the stately palaces that are built upon both sides of her banks so thick; which made divers foreign ambassadors affirm that the most glorious sight, take land and water together, was to come upon a high tide from Gravesend, and shoot the bridge to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</quote> It is a proof of the little need there was to provide for any except water traffic, that except <placeName key="bart,London Bridge">London Bridge</placeName> there was no bridge over the river in London until <placeName key="bart,Westminster Bridge">Westminster Bridge</placeName> was built in the middle of the last century. <hi rend="italics">All</hi> the existing bridges date from   the present century.   Hackney coaches were not invented till the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, and these excited the utmost fury in the minds of the Watermen, who had hitherto had the monopoly of all means of public locomotion. Taylor, the Water Poet, who died in <dateStruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></dateStruct>, writes-
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">After a mask or a play at the Court, even the very earth quakes and trembles, the casements shatter, tatter, and clatter, and such a confused noise is made, so that a man can neither sleep, speak, hear, write, or eat his dinner or supper quiet for them.</quote>

</p><p>The <num value="1">first</num> Hackney Coach stand, which existed till <dateStruct value="1853"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>, was established in front of <placeName key="cruch,St. Mary-le-strand">St. Mary-le-Strand</placeName> by Captain Baily in <dateStruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></dateStruct>, in which year also Strafford's Letters relate that <quote>sometimes there are <num value="20">twenty</num> of them together, which disperse up and down,</quote> and that <quote>they and others are to be had everywhere as Watermen are to be had at the waterside.</quote> In the same year the Watermen complained vehemently to the king that the hackney coaches were <quote>not confined to going north and south, but that their plying and carrying of people east and west, to and fro, in the streets and places abutting upon the river doth utterly <pb id="p.xxxiii" n="xxxiii"/> ruinate your petitioners.</quote> In <dateStruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></dateStruct> the hackney-coaches were limited.   In <dateStruct value="1636-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1636">1636</year></dateStruct> the coachmen petitioned to be made into a corporation, so that <num value="100">one hundred</num> might have coaches and pay the king a <num value="100">hundred</num> a year for the right. This number gradually increased, but has only been unlimited since <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>.
</p><p>In their early existence hackney-coaches had not only he Watermen to contend with.   Prince Charles and the  Duke of Buckingham   had brought back with them   from  Spain several Sedan chairs, and, though these at <num value="1">first</num> excited the utmost contempt, people <quote>loathing that men should be brought to as servile a condition as horses,</quote> their comparative safety on such rugged pavements as the streets were afflicted with in those days soon made them popular, and they continued to be the fashion for a century and a half  They were not, however, without their disadvantages.  Swift describes the   position of a London dandy in a shower-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Box'd in a chair the beau impatient sits,</l>
<l>While spouts run clattering o&#x00AB;er the roof by fits;</l>
<l>And ever and anon with frightful din</l>
<l>The leather sounds ;--he trembles from within.</l></quote>

</p><p>The discomforts of the streets, however, then made all means of locomotion unpleasant: thus Gay says-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Let others in the jolting coach confide,</l>
<l>Or in the leaky boat the Thames divide,</l>
<l>Or, box'd within the chair, contemn the street,</l>
<l>And trust their safety to another's feet:</l>
<l>Still let me walk.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Not only are the pavements improved, and the streets lighted by gas, but we have now every facility of transport. <pb id="p.xxxiv" n="xxxiv"/> Cabs are unlimited, and Hansom-cabs, so named from their inventor. Omnibuses, only introduced from Paris in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, now run in every direction, and transport those who are not above using them, for immense distances and very small fares. More expensive, and more disagreeable, but still very convenient for those who are in a hurry, is the underground Metropolitan Railway, which makes a circle round London from <placeName key="bart,Cannon Street">Cannon Street</placeName> (the <quote><placeName key="cruch,Mansion house">Mansion House</placeName></quote> ) to <placeName key="bart,Aldgate">Aldgate</placeName>, with stations at all the principal points upon the way.</p>
<p>A pleasant way of learning <num value="1">one</num>'s London, as of seeing Rome, is to follow some consecutive guiding thread, such as the life of a particular person, and seeing what it shows us. The life of Milton, for example, would lead from his birthplace in <placeName key="bart,Bread Street">Bread Street</placeName> and his school at <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>, to the sites of his houses in <placeName key="cruch,St. Bride's church">St. Bride's</placeName> Churchyard, <placeName key="bart,Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Spring Gardens">Spring Gardens</placeName>, <placeName key="cruch,Scotland yard">Scotland Yard</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Petty France">Petty France</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Bartholomew Close">Bartholomew Close</placeName>, and <placeName key="cruch,Jewin street">Jewin Street</placeName>, and so by the place of his death in Bunhill Fields to his grave at <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName>, Cripplegate.</p>
<p>No <num value="1">one</num> can consider the subject without regretting that no official care-taker is appointed   for the historical memorials of London, without whose consent the house of Milton in <placeName key="bart,Petty France">Petty France</placeName> could not have been swept away, and whose influence might be exerted to save at least the picturesque tower of the church which commemorates his baptism, with Dryden's inscription; who might have interposed to save the Tabard Inn, and have prevented the unnecessary destruction of St. Antholin's Tower: who, when a time-honoured burial-ground is turned into a recreation-ground, might suggest that, as in France, advantage <pb id="p.xxxv" n="xxxv"/> should be taken of all the sinuosities and irregularities which gave the place its picturesqueness, instead of levelling them, and overlaying them with yellow gravel and imitation rockwork, ruthlessly tearing up tombstones from the graves to which they belong, and planting paltry flowers and stunted evergreens in their place, as in the historic though now ruined burial-ground of <placeName key="cruch,St. Pancras">St. Pancras</placeName>.   <quote lang="FR">Les Monuments sont les crampons qui unissent une gen&#x00E9;ration &#x00E0; une autre; conservez ce qu'ont vu vos p&#x00E8;res,</quote> is well said by Joubert in his <title>Pens&#x00E9;es</title>.</p>
<p>Dwellers in the West End never cease to regret the need of the street scavengers, who in even the smaller towns of France and Germany would be employed daily to gather up and carry away the endless litter of orange-peel and paper which is allowed to lie neglected for months, hopelessly vulgarising the grass and flowers of London parks and squares,--a small but contemptible disgrace to our city, which is much commented upon by foreigners.</p>
<p>Another point which greatly requires a competent and well informed supervision is the nomenclature of the streets. Almost all the older blocks of houses have possessed an inmate or seen an event they might commemorate, and new streets are usually built on land connected with something which might give them a name; so that it is simply contemptible that there should be <num value="95">95</num> streets in London called King; <num value="99">99</num> Queen; <num value="78">78</num> Princes; <num value="009">009</num> George; <num value="119">119</num> John; <num value="91">91</num> Charles; <num value="87">87</num> James; <num value="58">58</num> Thomas; <num value="47">47</num> Henry; <num value="54">54</num> Alfred; <num value="88">88</num> William; <num value="57">57</num> Elizabeth; <num value="91">91</num> Church; <num value="69">69</num> Chapel; <num value="129">129</num> Union; <num value="166">166</num> New; go North and South; <num value="50">50</num> East and West; <num value="127">127</num> York; <num value="87">87</num> Gloucester; <num value="56">56</num> Cambridge; <num value="76">76</num> Brunswick; <num value="70">70</num> Devonshire; <num value="60">60</num> Norfolk; <num value="50">50</num> Richmond, &amp;c. <pb id="p.xxxvi" n="xxxvi"/></p>
<p>The Artist in London will find much less difficulty than he anticipates in sketching in the streets, as people are generally too busy to stop to look at him. But, if accustomed to the facilities and liberality met with in Continental cities, he will be quite wearied out with the petty obstacles thrown in his way by every <num value="1">one</num> who can make an obstacle to throw. From the Benchers of the Temple to the humblest churchwarden, each official demands to the utmost, orders signed and countersigned, so that no jot of the little meed of homage to their individual self-importance can by any possibility be overlooked.</p>
<p>There are many who, amid the fatigues of society, might find the utmost refreshment of mind and body in mornings spent amid the tombs at <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>; the pictures of the City Companies, the Learned Societies or the great houses of the West End; but most of all in rambles through the ancient bye-ways of the City. There are many more, especially young men, for whom time in London hangs very heavy, and to whom the perpetual lounge in the Park must end by becoming wearisome and monotonous, and for these a new mine of interest and pleasure is only waiting to be worked. If they will take even the Walks indicated in these volumes, they can scarcely fail to end them by agreeing with Dr. Johnson that <quote>he who is tired of London is tired of existence.</quote> To them especially the author would say, in the words of Shakspeare--

</p><p>In <dateStruct value="1266--"><year reg="1266">1266</year></dateStruct> a village on this site was spoken of as Cherringe, where William of Radnor, Bishop of Landaff, asked permission of Henry III. to take up his abode in a hermitage during   his visits to London.      This earlier mention of the name unfortunateley   renders it impossible to derive it, as has been often done, from <foreign lang="FR">La Ch&#x00E8;re Reine</foreign>, Eleanor, wife of Edward I.,   <quote lang="LA">mulier pia, modesta, misericors, Anglicorum omnium amatrix</quote> to whom her husband erected here the last of the <num value="9">nine</num> crosses which marked the resting-places of the beloved corpse in <dateStruct value="1291--"><year reg="1291">1291</year></dateStruct> on its way from Lincoln to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.      More probably the name is derived from the Saxon word Charan, to turn, both the road and river making a bend here. The other crosses in memory of Eleanor were at Lincoln, Northampton, Stoney <placeName key="cruch,Stratford">Stratford</placeName>, Woburn, Dunstable, St. Albans, Waltham, and Cheap; and <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> of these only those of Northampton and Waltham remain. That of Charing was the most magnificent of all: it was designed by Richard and Roger de Coverdale, with figures by Alexander of Abingdon.   The modern cross erected in front of <placeName key="bart,Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> Railway Station is intended as a reproduction of it.   The old cross was pulled down in <dateStruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></dateStruct> by the Puritans, amid great lamentations from the opposite party.

<p>The site of the cross was the spot chosen in <dateStruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></dateStruct> for the execution of the Regicides.

It is the work of <hi rend="italic">Hubert Le Sueur</hi>, and was originally ordered by the Lord Treasurer Weston for his <figure id="Fig.001" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.033.DO01.00001"><head>At Charing Cross</head></figure>gardens  at Roehampton.   Walpole narrates that it was sold by the Parliament to <num value="1">one</num> John Rivet, a brazier, living at the Dial near <placeName key="bart,Holborn">Holborn</placeName> Conduit, with strict orders to break it to pieces.   Instead of doing this he concealed it in the vaults under the Church of St. Paul, Covent Garden, and making some brass handles for knives, and producing them as fragments of the statue, realised a large sum <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> by their sale, as well to royalists who bought them from love of the king, as to rebels who saw in them a mark of their triumph. At the Restoration the statue was mounted upon its present beautiful pedestal, which is the work of <hi rend="italic">Joshua Marshall</hi>, Master Mason   to the Crown, and which, till recently, was always wreathed with oak on the <dateStruct value="-05-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, the anniversary   of the Restoration.     The metal round the fore-foot of the horse bears the inscription <quote lang="LA">HVBER(T) LE SVEVR (FE)CIT. <dateStruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></dateStruct>:</quote>   On the erection of the statue, Waller wrote the lines-

</p><p>The most interesting approach to the City of London is by that which leads to it from   Charing Cross--the great highway of <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName>, <quote>down which the tide of labour flows daily to the City,</quote> <note id="n.5.2">Blanchard Jerrold.</note> and where Charles Lamb says that he <quote>often shed tears for fulness of joy at such multitude of life.</quote> To us, when we think of it, <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> is only a vast thoroughfare crowded with traffic, and the place whither we go to find Exeter Hall, or the <placeName key="cruch,Adelphi">Adelphi</placeName> or Gaiety theatres, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> as our taste may guide us. But the name which the street still bears will remind us of its position, following the <hi rend="italics">strand</hi>, the shore, of the Thames. This was the <num value="1">first</num> cause of its popularity, and of its becoming for <num value="300">three hundred</num> years what the Corso is to Rome, and the Via Nuova to Genoa, a street of palaces. The rise of these palaces was very gradual. As late as the reign of Edward II. (<dateStruct value="1315--"><year reg="1315">1315</year></dateStruct>) a petition was presented complaining that the road from <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName> to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> was so infamously bad that it was ruinous to the feet both of men and horses, and moreover that it was overgrown with thickets and bushes. In the time of Edward III. the rapid watercourses which crossed that road and fell into the Thames were traversed by bridges, of which there were <num value="3">three</num> between <placeName key="bart,Charing Cross">Charing Cross</placeName> and <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName>. Of <num value="2">two</num> of these bridges the names are still preserved to us in the names of <num value="2">two</num> existing streets- Ivy <placeName key="bart,Bridge Lane">Bridge Lane</placeName> and Strand <placeName key="bart,Bridge Lane">Bridge Lane</placeName>; the <num value="3">third</num> bridge has itself been seen by many living persons. It was discovered in <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>, buried deep beneath the soil near <placeName key="cruch,St. Clement's church">St. Clement's Church</placeName>, and was laid bare during the formation of some new sewers. In the reign of Henry VIII. <quote>the road of <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> was still described as full of pits and sloughs, very perilous and noisome.</quote> But <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> was the highway from the royal palace at <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> to the royal palace on the Fleet, and so became popular with the aristocracy. Gradually great houses had sprung up along its course, the earliest being Essex House, <placeName key="cruch,Durham house">Durham House</placeName>, and the Palace of the Bishops of Norwich, afterwards called York House; though even in Elizabeth's time the succession was rather <num value="1">one</num> of country palaces than of town residences, for all the great houses looked into fields upon the north, <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> and on the south had large and pleasant gardens sloping towards the river.
</p><p>Till the Great Fire drove the impulse of building westwards and the open ground of <placeName key="bart,Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> and its neighbourhood was built upon, <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> was scarcely a street in its present sense; but it was already crowded as a thoroughfare. Even in <dateStruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></dateStruct> George Wither, the Puritan Poet, in his <title>Britain's Remembrancer,</title> speaks of-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l><placeName key="bart,The Strand">The Strand</placeName>, that goodly throw-fare betweene</l>
<l>The Court and City: and where I have scene</l>
<l>Well-nigh a million passing in <num value="1">one</num> day.</l></quote>
 It was in <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> that (<dateStruct value="1660-05-29"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="29">29</day>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></dateStruct>) Evelyn <quote>stood and beheld and blessed God</quote> for the triumphal entry of Charles II.
</p><p>As the houses closed in <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago and <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> became a regular street, it was enlivened by every house and shop having its own sign, which long took the place of the numbers now attached to them. Chaucer and Shakspeare when in London would have been directed to at the sign of the Dog, or the Golden Unicorn, or the <num value="3">Three</num> Crowns, or whatever the emblem of the house might be at which they were residing. The signs were all swept away in the reign of George III., both because they had then acquired so great a size, and projected so far over the street, and because on a windy day they were blown to and fro with horrible creaking and groaning, and were often torn off and thrown down, killing the foot-passengers in their fall. Many old London signs are preserved in the City Museum of the <placeName key="cruch,Guildhall">Guildhall</placeName>, and are very curious. The persons who lived in the houses so distinguished were frequently <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> surnamed from their signs. Thus the famous Thomas h Becket was in his youth called <quote>Thomas of the Snipe,</quote> from the emblem of the house where he was born.
</p><p><num value="1">One</num> only of the great Strand palaces has survived entire to our own time. We have all of us seen and mourned over <placeName key="cruch,Northumberland house">Northumberland House</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest Jacobean buildings in England, and the most picturesque feature of London. The original design was by Jansen, but it was altered by Inigo Jones, and from the plans of the latter the house was begun (in <dateStruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></dateStruct>) by Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, who was ridiculed for building so large a residence in the then country village of Charing. He bequeathed it to his nephew, the Earl of Suffolk, who was the builder of Audley End, and who finished the garden side of the house. It was then called Suffolk House, but changed its name (in <dateStruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></dateStruct>) when Elizabeth, daughter of the <num value="2">second</num> Earl of Suffolk, married Algernon Percy, <num value="10">tenth</num> Earl of Northumberland. On his death it passed to his daughter, Lady Elizabeth Percy, who was twice a widow and <num value="3">three</num> times a wife before she was <num value="17">seventeen</num>. Her <num value="3">third</num> husband was Charles Seymour, commonly called the proud Duke of Somerset, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the chief figures in the pageants and politics of <num value="6">six</num> reigns, having supported the chief mourner at the funeral of Charles II., and carried the orb at the coronation of George II.   It was this Duke who never allowed his daughters to sit down in his presence, even when they were nursing him for days and weeks together, in his <num value="87">eighty-seventh</num> year at <placeName key="cruch,Northumberland house">Northumberland House</placeName>, and who omitted <num value="1">one</num> of his daughters in his will because he caught her involuntarily napping by his bedside. In his last years his punctiliousness so little decreased that when <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> his <num value="2">second</num> wife, Lady Charlotte Finch, once ventured to pat him playfully on the shoulder, he turned round upon her with, <quote>Madam, my <num value="1">first</num> wife was a Percy, and she would never have taken such a liberty.</quote> It was a son of this proud Duke who was created Earl of Northumberland, with remainder to his only daughter, who married Sir Hugh Smithson, created Duke of Northumberland in <dateStruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></dateStruct>. Added to, and altered at different periods, the greater part of the house, though charming as a residence, was architecturally unimportant. But when it was partially rebuilt, the original features of <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> front had always been preserved-and as we saw its beautiful gateway, so with the exception of a few additional ornaments, Inigo Jones designed it. The balustrade was originally formed by an inscription in capital letters, as at Audley End and Temple Newsam, and it is recorded that the fall of <num value="1">one</num> of these letters killed a spectator as the funeral of Anne of Denmark was passing. High above the porch stood for a <num value="125">hundred and twenty-five</num> years a leaden lion, the crest of the Percies (now removed to Syon House); and it was a favourite question, which few could answer right, which way the familiar animal's tail pointed. Of all the barbarous and ridiculous injuries by which London has been wantonly mutilated within the last few years, the destruction of <placeName key="cruch,Northumberland house">Northumberland House</placeName> has been the greatest. The removal of some ugly houses on the west, and the sacrifice of a corner of the garden, might have given a better turn to the street now called <placeName key="bart,Northumberland Avenue">Northumberland Avenue</placeName>, and have saved the finest great historical house in London, <quote>commenced by a Howard, continued by a Percy, and completed by a Seymour</quote> --the house in which the restoration of the <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> monarchy was successfully planned in <dateStruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></dateStruct> in the secret conferences of General Monk.
</p><p>It is just beyond the now melancholy site of <placeName key="cruch,Northumberland house">Northumberland House</placeName> that we enter upon what is still called <quote><placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName>.</quote> If we could linger, as we might in the early morning, when there would be no great traffic to hinder us, we should see that, even now, the great street is far from unpicturesque. Its houses, projecting, receding, still ornamented here and there with bow-windows, sometimes with a little sculpture or pargetting work, present a very broken outline to the sky; and, at the end, in the blue haze which is so beautiful on a fine day in London, rises the Flemish-looking steeple of St. Mary le Strand with the light streaming through its open pillars.
</p><p><placeName key="bart,The Strand">The Strand</placeName> palaces are gone now.   In Italian cities, which love their reminiscences and guard them, their sites would be marked by inscribed tablets let into the later houses.   This is not the way with Englishmen; yet, even in England, they have their own commemoration, and in <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName> the old houses and the old residents have their record in the names of the adjoining streets on either side the way.   Gay, calling upon his friend Fortescue to walk west with him from <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName>, thus alludes to them:--
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Come, Fortescue, sincere, experienced friend,</l>

</p><p>We must turn to the right, immediately beyond the station, to visit the remnants of the famous palace known as York House.

He in his turn lived here as Chancellor, and was greatly attached to the place; for when the Duke <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> of Lennox wished him to sell his interest in it, he answered, <quote>For this you will pardon me, York House is the house where my father died, and where I <num value="1">first</num> breathed, and there   I will yield my last breath, please God and the king.</quote>

Peter the Great lived in the upper part of this house when he was in England, and used to spend his evenings here with Lord Caermarthen, drinking hot brandy with pepper in it; and here also Dickens, who lived here for some time himself, makes his David Copperfield reside in <quote>a singularly desirable, compact set of chambers, forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman.</quote> The house on the other side the way, upon which the windows of this old house looked out, was occupied by Samuel Pepys.

It was not till <dateStruct value="1621"><year reg="1621">1621</year></dateStruct> that the houses around the square were built from designs of Inigo Jones, but then, and long afterwards, the market continued to be held under the shade of what Stow calls <quote>a grotto of trees,</quote> hanging over the wall of the grounds of Bedford House (now commemorated in <placeName key="bart,Bedford Street">Bedford Street</placeName>), which bounded Covent Garden on the south. Many allusions in the works of the poets of Charles II.'s time show that this, which Sydney Smith calls <quote>the amorous and herbivorous parish of Covent Garden,</quote> was then <num value="1">one</num> of the most fashionable quarters of London--in fact, that it was the <placeName key="bart,Belgrave Square">Belgrave Square</placeName> of the Stuarts, and it will always be classic ground from its association with the authors and wits of the last century. When Bedford House was pulled down in <dateStruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></dateStruct>, the market gradually, by the increasing traffic, became pushed into the middle of the area, and finally has usurped the whole, though a print by Sutton Nichols shows that as late as <num value="8100">8100</num> it only consisted of a few sheds.
</p><p>The north and east sides of the market are still occupied by the arcade, <num value="1">first</num> called <quote>the Portico Walk,</quote> but which has long borne the quaint name of <hi rend="italics">Piazza</hi>, an open corridor like those which line the streets of Italian towns. It is common-place enough   now   with ugly   plastered columns, but when originally built by Inigo Jones, was highly picturesque, with its carved grey stone pillars relieved upon a red brick front. There is an odd evidence of the popularity of the piazza in the time of Charles II., James II., and William III., in the fact that <quote>piazza</quote> was <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> chosen as the favourite name for the foundling children of the parish. The registers abound in such names as Peter Piazza, Mary Piazza, and Paul Piazza. It was the custom in those days to lay all foundling children at the doors of the unfortunate Bishop of Durham, and leave them there. In the last century the square was used for the football matches, which are described by Gay:--
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Where Covent Garden's famous temple stands,</l>

     <p>When St. Martin-in-the-Felds became too small for its parishioners, Francis, <num value="5">fifth</num> Earl of Bedford, to whom all this neighbourhood belonged, desired Inigo Jones to build him a chapel in Covent Garden, but said that he would not go to any expense about it--in short, that it must be little better than a barn. <quote>Then it shall be the handsomest barn in England,</quote> said Inigo Jones, and he built <rs type="subject"><placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>, Covent Garden</rs> (always interesting as the <num value="1">first</num> important Protestant church raised in England), which exactly fulfils his promise. Bare, uncouth, and featureless in its general forms, it nevertheless becomes really picturesque from the noble play of light and shade caused by its boldly projecting roof, and the deeply receding portico behind its <num value="2">two</num> pillars. The most serious defect is that this portico leads to nothing, for, in order to have the altar to the east, the entrance is at the side, and the altar behind the portico. The interior is a miserable, featureless parallelogram.

</p><p>On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, its especial market-days, Covent Garden should be visited.

In this churchyard, and on the ground now occupied by all the neighbouring courts and warehouses, once stood the famous <rs type="subject">Savoy Palace</rs>. Having been built by Peter, brother of Archbishop Boniface, and uncle of Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III., when he came over on a visit to his niece, it became a centre for all the princes, ecclesiastics, and artists who flowed into London in consequence of her marriage. He bequeathed it to the monks of Montjoy at Havering at the Bower, from whom it was bought by Queen Eleanor for her <num value="2">second</num> son Edmund, Earl of Lancaster. It continued in the hands of his descendants, and, after the battle of Poitiers, in <dateStruct value="1356--"><year reg="1356">1356</year></dateStruct>, became the residence of the captive King John of France. John was set free in <dateStruct value="1360-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1360">1360</year></dateStruct>, but being unable to fulfil the conditions of his release, and unwilling to cede to his captor the Black Prince in chivalry and honour, voluntarily returned, and being again assigned a residence in the Savoy, died there <dateStruct value="1364-04-9"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="9">9</day>, <year reg="1364">1364</year></dateStruct>, at which, says Froissart, <quote>the King, Queen, and princes of the blood, and all the nobles of England, were exceedingly concerned, from the great love and affection King John had shown them since the conclusion of peace.</quote> </p><pb id="p.30" n="30"/>
   <p>While the Savoy was the London residence of John of Gaunt, the poet Chaucer was married here to Philippa de Ruet, a lady in the household of Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster, and sister of Catherine Swyneford, who became the Duke's <num value="2">second</num> wife. In <dateStruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></dateStruct> <quote>the Duke of Lancaster's house of the Savoy, to the which,</quote> says Stow, <quote>there was none in the realme to be compared in beauty and statelinesse,</quote> was pillaged and burnt by the rebels under Wat Tyler, to punish the Duke for the protection he had afforded to the followers of Wickliffe. <num value="32">Thirty-two</num> of the assailants lingered so long drinking up the sweet wine in the cellars, that they were walled in, and <quote>were heard crying and calling <num value="7">seven</num> daies after, but none came to helpe them out till they were dead.</quote> Hardyng's Chronicle commemorates the flight of John of Gaunt from the Savoy :--

</p><p>The Savoy was never restored as a palace, but Henry VII. rebuilt it as a hospital in honour of John the Baptist, and endowed it by his will. The hospital was suppressed by Edward VI., but refounded by Mary, and only finally dissolved in the reign of Elizabeth.

</p><p>Soon after the Restoration the Conference of the Savoy <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> was held here for the revision of the Liturgy so as to meet the feelings of the Nonconformists, in which <num value="12">twelve</num> bishops of the Church of England met an equal number of Nonconformists in discussion.

      <p>The remains of the Savoy palace were all swept away when <placeName key="bart,Waterloo Bridge">Waterloo Bridge</placeName> was built. Originally dedicated to St. John the Baptist, it was called <rs type="Subject">St. Mary le Savoy</rs>, because it served as a church for the parish of St. Mary le Strand. The church was the chapel, not of the palace, but of Henry VII.'s hospital. There is a tradition that <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> the Liturgy restored by Elizabeth was <num value="1">first</num> read in this chapel in the vernacular tongue. It is of Perpendicular architecture (<dateStruct value="1505--"><year reg="1505">1505</year></dateStruct>), with a quaint low belfry like those of many small churches in Northumberland.   The interior was entirely destroyed by fire in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and was for the <num value="2">second</num> time renewed by the munificence of the Queen as Duchess of Lancaster.   It has a rich coloured roof, and resembles a college chapel; but the tombs which formerly made it so interesting perished in the flames. Only <num value="1">one</num> small figure from Lady Dalhousie's monument is preserved, and the brass of Gavin Douglas, the Bishop of Dunkeld, son of Archibald Bell the Cat, Earl of Angus, who is represented   in <title>Marmion</title> as celebrating the wedding of De Wilton and Clare :

But long before it was finished (<dateStruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></dateStruct>) the Protector had been beheaded on <placeName key="bart,Tower Hill">Tower Hill</placeName>, and his house was bestowed upon the Princess Elizabeth.

      <p>Beyond the east wing of <placeName key="cruch,Somerset house">Somerset House</placeName>, occupied by <placeName key="cruch,King's college">King's College</placeName> and school, runs the narrow alley called <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="cruch,Strand lane">Strand Lane</placeName></rs>, which formerly ended at the landing-place, called Strand Bridge, where we read in the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> that Addison <quote>landed with <num value="10">ten</num> sail of apricot-boats.</quote> On the left of the winding paved lane a sign directs us to the <rs type="Subject">Old Roman Spring Bath</rs>, and in this quiet corner we find <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable relics of Roman London--a vaulted room containing, enclosed in brick-work and masonry, apparently Roman, a beautiful bath of crystal water, <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet long, <num value="6">six</num> feet broad, and <num value="4">four</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches deep.   It is believed that the wonderfully cold, clear water comes from the miraculous well of St. Clement, which gave a name to the neighbouring <placeName key="cruch,Holywell street">Holywell Street</placeName>, and was once greatly resorted to for its cures. A <num value="2">second</num> bath, in the same building, still used, and with chalybeate properties, is shown as having been constructed by Elizabeth's Earl of Essex, when he was residing hard by in Essex House.   It is said that it was in a house in this neighbourhood that Guy Fawkes and his comrades took the oath of secrecy and received the sacrament before attempting to carry out the Gunpowder Plot. <pb id="p.38" n="38"/></p> 
     <p>Here, in the midst of the street, rises the <rs type="Subject">Church of <placeName key="cruch,St. Mary-le-strand">St. Mary-le-Strand</placeName></rs>, which is of interest as being the <num value="1">first</num> of the <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches whose erection was ordained in Queen Anne's reign, the original <placeName key="cruch,St. Mary's church">St. Mary's</placeName> having been destroyed by the Protector Somerset when he was building <placeName key="cruch,Somerset house">Somerset House</placeName>, which covers its site. Gibbs was the architect of the present church, but its steeple, so beautiful in spite of having the fault of appearing to stand upon the roof of the church, was not part of the original design. The church was to have been towerless, but a stately column <num value="250">250</num> feet high (<hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>. <num value="105">105</num> feet higher than the Nelson column in <placeName key="bart,Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</placeName>) was to have riser. beside it, crowned by a statue of Queen Anne. But the Queen died before the plan was carried out, and flattery being no longer necessary, the church had its steeple. It occupies the site of the famous May-pole, <num value="134">one hundred and thirty-four</num> feet high, which was destroyed in the Commonwealth as <quote>a last remnant of vile heathenism, an idol of the people.</quote> It was re-erected with great pomp under Charles II., by Clarges, the <placeName key="bart,Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> farrier, to commemorate the good fortune of his daughter in becoming a duchess by having married General Monk when he was a private gentleman. The tract called <title>The Citie's Loyaltie Displayed</title> relates how it was set up by seamen under the command of James, Duke of York, Lord High Admiral, no landsmen being able to raise it, and how, as it rose, <quote>the little children did much rejoice, and ancient people did clap their hands, saying golden days began to appear.</quote> Gathered around the last May-pole on this spot, <num value="4000">four thousand</num>   London   school-children   sang a hymn as Queen Anne passed in triumphant procession to <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> take part in the public thanksgiving at <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName> for the Peace of Utrecht. The May-pole was finally removed in <dateStruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></dateStruct>, and, being given to Sir Isaac Newton, was set up in Sir Richard Child's park at Wanstead in Essex, where it was used for raising a telescope. The London May-pole was long commemorated in May-pole Lane, the old name of <placeName key="cruch,Newcastle street">Newcastle Street</placeName>.

 The <rs type="subject">Church of St. Clement Danes</rs> was erected in <dateStruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></dateStruct> by Edward Pierce, under the superintendence of Wren. In the old church, from its vicinity to Exeter House, were buried John Booth, Bishop of Exeter (<dateStruct value="1478--"><year reg="1478">1478</year></dateStruct>), and his brother, Sir William, who died in the same year; and John Arundell, Bishop of Exeter (<dateStruct value="1503--"><year reg="1503">1503</year></dateStruct>).   Here also was a monument to the <num value="1">first</num> wife of Dr. John Donne, the poet-dean of <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>, who preached in the church soon after her death on the words, <quote>Lo, I am the man that hath seen affliction.</quote> And <quote>indeed his very words and looks testified him to be truly such a man.</quote> It was this wife whose spirit he saw twice pass through his room at Paris, bearing the dead child to which she was then giving birth. Like all Wren's parish churches, the existing building depends entirely upon its <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> steeple, which is built in several stories, for its reputation. Its bells chime merrily, even to a proverb-
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Oranges and lemons,</l>
<l>Say the bells of <placeName key="cruch,St. Clement's church">St. Clement's</placeName>;</l></quote>
but the chimes can also play the Old Hundredth Psalm and other tunes.   Here Dr. Johnson sate in church, <quote>repeating,</quote> as Boswell says, <quote>the responses in the Litany with tremulous energy,</quote> and here in his <num value="75">seventy-fifth</num> year (<dateStruct value="1784"><year reg="1784">1784</year></dateStruct>) he returned public thanks for a recovery from dangerous illness. A brass plate now appropriately marks the pew (No. <num value="18">18</num>) in the north gallery whither the old man, who was so vehement in discussion and fierce in argument on week-days, never failed to come humbly on Sundays, to seek, in his own words, <quote>how to purify and fortify his soul, and hold real communion with the Highest.</quote> It was in this church that, on October ii, <dateStruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></dateStruct>, Sir Thomas Grosvenor was married to Miss Mary Davies, the humble heiress of the farm now occupied by <placeName key="bart,Grosvenor Square">Grosvenor Square</placeName> and its surroundings, which have brought such enormous wealth to his family. In the vestry house is a painting executed for the church as an altar-piece, by Kent the landscape gardener, intended to represent a choir of angels playing in chorus. In <dateStruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></dateStruct> an order was issued by Bishop Gibson for its removal on account of its being supposed to contain surreptitious portraits of the Pretender's wife and children. It was removed to a neighbouring tavern--the Crown and Anchor-celebrated for the meetings of <quote>the Whittington Club.</quote> Here it was parodied in an engraving by Hogarth, with a comic description which caused intense amusement at the time. After some years it was restored to the parish, but not to the church. </p><pb id="p.43" n="43"/>
<p>Of the strange name, St. Clement Danes, various explanations are given. Stow tells how the body of Harold, the illegitimate son of King Canute, buried at <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> after a reign of <num value="3">three</num> years, was exhumed by his successor, the legitimate Hardicanute, and thrown ignominiously into the Thames, and how a fisherman, seeing it floating upon the river, took it up and buried it reverently on this spot. This is the more picturesque story; but perhaps that of Strype is more likely, who says that when Alfred expelled the remnant of the Danish nation in <dateStruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>, those who had married English wives were still permitted to live here, whence the name-St. Clement Danes.</p> 
   <p>The <quote>fair fountain,</quote> formerly called <placeName key="cruch,St. Clement's church">St. Clement's</placeName> Well, after becoming a pump, was finally destroyed in <dateStruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></dateStruct>, but is commemorated in <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="cruch,Clement's inn">Clement's Inn</placeName></rs>-to the left, at the entrance of <placeName key="cruch,Wych street">Wych Street</placeName>, now an Inn of Court dependent on the Temple, but originally intended for the use of patients coming to the miraculous waters of the well. Shakespeare introduces it in his <hi rend="italics">Henry IV</hi>. as the home of <quote>Master Shallow.</quote> We should walk through its quiet red-brick courts, by the quaint chapel, where an anchor commemorates the martyrdom of the sainted Pope Clement, who was tied to an anchor and thrown into the sea. Hence, through a brick archway, we have a pleasant glimpse of trees and flowers, and enter a garden square, in the centre of which, in front of <quote>the Garden House,</quote> a picturesque relic of Queen Anne's time, is a curious kneeling figure of a Moor supporting a sun-dial, brought from Italy by Holles, Lord Clare. At the time when these examples of <quote>God's image carved in ebony</quote> were popular in ancient gardens.<note id="n.43.1">There are similar figures at Knowsley, and at Arley in Cheshire</note> a clever <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> squib upon its owners was once found attached to the Moor of <placeName key="cruch,Clement's inn">Clement's Inn</placeName>:

      <p>We now come to <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="bart,Essex Street">Essex Street</placeName></rs>, where Dr. King in his Anecdotes of his own Time describes his presentation to Prince Charles Edward in <dateStruct value="1750-09--"><month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1750">1750</year></dateStruct>, at the house <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> of lady Primrose. It was the Prince's only visit to London, and he was only there <num value="5">five</num> days. The same Lady Primrose (daughter of Drelincourt, Dean of Armagh, and widow of Hugh, <num value="3">3rd</num> Viscount Primrose) gave a home in <dateStruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></dateStruct> to Flora Macdonald after her release by the government. <placeName key="bart,Essex Street">Essex Street</placeName> occupies the site of Exeter House, which was built by Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter.   Here he was besieged by the people when he was holding London for Edward II., and, having fled to take sanctuary at <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>, was beheaded, and brought back to be buried under a dust-heap by his own gateway. After the Reformation, Exeter House was inhabited by the   Earl of Leicester, and then by Elizabeth's latest favourite, the Earl of Essex (whose Countess was the widow   of Sir Philip Sidney), when the name was changed to Essex House.   It was here that the handsome earl tried to rouse the people against Sir R. Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, and other reigning court favourites whom he believed to have been the cause of his losing his ascendancy over the Queen. Here he was blockaded, cannon being pointed at Essex House from the roofs of the neighbouring houses and the tower of St. Clement Danes, and hence, having surrendered, he was taken away to the Tower, where he was beheaded. It is to Essex House that Spenser alludes, after describing the Temple, in the Prothalamion:--
<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Next whereunto there standes a stately place,</l>

<p>Just within <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName> we may turn aside into the repose of the <num value="1">first</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> Inns of Court (Middle  Temple, Inner Temple, <placeName key="cruch,Lincoln's inn">Lincoln's Inn</placeName>, and <placeName key="cruch,Gray's inn">Gray's Inn</placeName>), which Ben Jonson calls <quote>the noblest nurseries of humanity and liberty in the kingdom.</quote> Here, beside the bustle of  <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, yet utterly removed from it, are the groups of ancient buildings described by Spenser :--
                              <quote rend="blockquote"><l part="F">those bricky towers,</l>
<l>The which on Thames' broad aged back doe ride,</l>
<l>Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,</l>
<l>There whilom wont the Temple knights to bide,</l>
<l>Till they decayed through pride.</l></quote>
  The earliest residence of the Knights Templar was in  <placeName key="bart,Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, but they removed hither in <dateStruct value="1184--"><year reg="1184">1184</year></dateStruct>.   After their suppression in <dateStruct value="1313--"><year reg="1313">1313</year></dateStruct> Edward I. gave the property to Aymer de Valence. At his death it passed into the hands of the  Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, but was leased to the  Inns of Court, so called because their inhabitants, who were students of the law, belonged to <quote>the King's Court.</quote> It is interesting to notice how many of the peculiar terms used by the Templars seem to have descended with the <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> place to their legal successors. Thus the serjeants-at-law represent the <foreign lang="LA">fratres servientes</foreign>--<foreign lang="FR">fr&#x00E8;res serjens</foreign> of the Templars; and the title of Knight reappears in that of the Judges.   The waiters were, and are still, called panniers, from the <foreign lang="LA">panarii</foreign>, bread-bearers, of the Templars; and the scullions are still called wash-pots. The register of the Temple is full of such entries as <quote>On <dateStruct value="-03-28"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="28">28th</day></dateStruct> died William Brown, wash-pot of the Temple.</quote>
</p><p>Before the Temple was leased by the lawyers, the laws were taught in hostels--<foreign lang="LA">hospitia curis</foreign>, of which there were a great number in the metropolis, especially in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="bart,Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, but afterwards the Inns of Court and Chancery increased in prosperity till they formed what Stow describes as <quote>a whole university of students, practisers or pleaders, and judges of the laws of this realm, not living on common stipends, as in the other universities it is for the most part done, but of their owne private maintenance.</quote> The name of <hi rend="italics">Hostel</hi> was continued in that of <hi rend="italics">Inn</hi>.   Butler, playing on the latter, speaks of
                                         <quote rend="blockquote"><l part="F">the hostess</l>
<l>Of the Inns of Court and Chancery-Justice.</l></quote>

</p><p>The prosperity of the lawyers, however, was not without its reverses, and such was their unpopularity at the time of Jack Cade's rebellion that they were chosen as his <num value="1">first</num> victims.   Thus, in Shakespeare's <title>Henry VI</title>. (Pt. I. Act iv. sc. a), Dick, the Butcher of Ashford, is introduced as saying, <quote>The <num value="1">first</num> thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers;</quote> to which Cade replies, <quote>Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled over, should undo a man?</quote> And in scene <num value="7">7</num> Cade <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> says, <quote>Now go some and pull down the Savoy; others to the Inns of Court; down with them all!</quote>
</p><p>In the end, Jack Cade really did the lawyers no harm, but their houses were pulled down in the invasion of Wat Tyler, and their books burnt in <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>. Nevertheless the Inns of the Temple continued to increase in importance till the reign of Mary I., when the young lawyers had become such notorious fops that it was actually necessary to pass an Act of Parliament to restrain them. Henceforth they were not to wear beards of more than <num value="3">three</num> weeks' growth upon pain of a fine of <measure key="40s." type="currency"><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>; and they must restrain their passion for Spanish cloaks, swords, bucklers, rapiers, gowns, hats, or daggers at their girdles.   Only Knights and Benchers might luxuriate in doublets or hose of bright colours, except scarlet or crimson; and they were forbidden to wear velvet caps, scarf-wings to their gowns, white jerkins, buskins, velvet shoes, double shirt-cuffs, or feathers and ribbons in their caps.
</p><p>The Temple was not finally conferred upon the lawyers till the time of James I., who declared in <num value="1">one</num> of his speeches in the Star Chamber that <quote>there were only <num value="3">three</num> classes of people who had any right to settle in London--the courtiers, the citizens, and the gentlemen of the Inns of Court.</quote> The division into <num value="2">two</num> Halls dates from the time of Henry VI., when the number of students who frequented the Temple <num value="1">first</num> made it necessary, and the <num value="2">two</num> Halls have ever since maintained a distinct individuality. Though their gateways rise almost side by side on the right of <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, and their courts and passages join, the utmost distinction exists in the minds of the inmates.
</p><p>Before any student can be admitted to either of the <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> Societies of the Inns of Court, he must obtain the certificate of <num value="2">two</num> barristers, and in the case of the Middle Temple that of a bencher, to show he is <quote lang="LA">aptus, habilis, et idoneus moribus et scientia.</quote> On his admission, he has the use of the library, may claim a seat in the church or chapel of the Inn, and can have his name set down for chambers.   He must then keep <hi rend="italics">commons</hi>, by dining in hall for <num value="12">twelve</num> terms, of which there are <num value="4">four</num> in each year. Before keeping terms, he must also deposit <measure key="100l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="100">100</num></measure>   with the treasurer, to be returned, without interest, when he is called to the Bar.
</p><p>No student can be <hi rend="italics">called</hi> till he. is of <num value="3">three</num> years' standing, and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years of age: after he is called, he becomes
<hi rend="italics">a Barrister</hi>. The call is made by the <hi rend="italics">Benchers</hi>, the governing body of seniors, chosen for their <quote>honest behaviour and good disposition,</quote> and <quote>such as from their experience are of best note and ability to serve the kingdom.</quote>
</p><p>Lectures are given at each of the Inns, which are open to all its students; examinations take place and scholarships are awarded: but a man may be called to the Bar who has not attended lectures or passed examinations, though <hi rend="italics">keeping commons</hi> by dining in hall is an indispensable qualification.
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>The Inns of Court are interesting to others besides lawyers, for they are the last working institutions in the nature of the old trade guilds.

      <p>A dull red-brick <hi rend="italics">Gate-way</hi>, by Wren (<dateStruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></dateStruct>), forms the entrance to <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="bart,Middle Temple Lane">Middle Temple Lane</placeName></rs>. The site was formerly occupied by a gate decorated with the arms of Cardinal  Wolsey, which was erected by Sir Amias Paulet while he was the cardinal's prisoner in the other Temple Gate-house, in the hope of appeasing his displeasure.</p> 
       <p>The <num value="2">second</num> <hi rend="italics">Gate-house</hi> belonging to the <rs type="Subject">Inner Temple</rs>
was once surmounted by gables and annexed to very picturesque buildings of great extent. Only a fragment of the ornamental portion remains, adorned with the feathers of Henry, Prince of Wales. A hairdresser of lively imagination has set up an inscription declaring it to have been the palace of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey, but it was really built in the time of James I., when it was the office for the Duchy of Cornwall. Afterwards it became <quote>Nando's,</quote> a coffee-house, where the foundation of Lord Thurlow's fortunes was laid. Some lawyers overheard him here arguing cleverly about some famous cause, and the next day he received his <num value="1">first</num> important brief. The sides of this gate are adorned with the arms of the Inner Temple, as that of the Middle Temple is with the lamb bearing the banner of Innocence and the red cross, which was the original badge of the Templars. Here the shields bear a horse, now representing Pegasus, with the motto, <quote lang="LA">Volat ad astera virtus,</quote> but when this emblem was originally chosen it was a horse with <num value="2">two</num> men upon it, the <num value="2">two</num> men on <num value="1">one</num> horse being intended to indicate the poverty of the Templars. The men gradually became worn from the shield, and when it was restored they were <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> mistaken for wings; hence the winged horse.   A   wit once wrote here:--
<quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="stanza"><l>As by the Templars' hold you go,</l>
<l>The horse and lamb display'd</l>
<l>In emblematic figures show</l>

 But very soon another inscription appeared from another witty hand:--

</p><p><placeName key="bart,The Lane">The Lane</placeName> and its surrounding streets have a peculiar legal traffic of their own, and abound in wig makers, strongbox makers, and law stationers and booksellers.   In former times when the Inns of Court were more like colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and when the students which belonged to them lived together within their walls, dined together, and shared the same exercises and amusements, the Inns of Court always had Inns of Chancery annexed to them. These were houses where the younger students underwent a course of preparation for the greater freedom of the colleges of the Inns of Court, to which, says Jeaffreson, in his <title>Book about Lawyers,</title> they bore much the same position as Eton bears towards <placeName key="cruch,King's college">King's College</placeName> at Cambridge, or Winchester to New College at Oxford.   Now the Inns of Chancery are comparative <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> solitudes: readers of Dickens will recollect the vivid descriptions of Symond's Inn in <title>Bleak House.</title>
</p> 
       <p>On the right of <placeName key="bart,Chancery Lane">Chancery Lane</placeName>, behind St. Dunstan's  Church, are the dark brick courts of <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="bart,Serjeants Inn">Serjeants' inn</placeName></rs>, originally intended only for judges and the serjeants-at-law   who derive their name from the <foreign lang="LA">Fratres Servientes</foreign> of the Knights  Templars. The serjeants still address each other as brothers.  The degree of Serjeant is the highest attainable in the faculty of law, and indispensable for a seat on the judicial bench. The buildings were sold in <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>, and the little Hall  (<num value="38">38</num> ft. by <num value="21">21</num>) and Chapel (<num value="31">31</num> ft. by <num value="20">20</num>)-both with richly stained windows--will probably ere long be pulled down.</p> 
     <p>The courts of <placeName key="bart,Serjeants Inn">Serjeants' Inn</placeName> join those of the earliest foundation of those Inns of Chancery which we have been describing, <rs type="Subject">Cifford's Inn</rs>   (entered   from   <placeName key="bart,Fetter Lane">Fetter Lane</placeName>), which is so called because the land on which it stands was devised in the reign of Edward II. (<dateStruct value="1310--"><year reg="1310">1310</year></dateStruct>) to <quote>our beloved and faithful Robert de Clifford.</quote> It was in the hall of <placeName key="cruch,Clifford's inn">Clifford's Inn</placeName> that Sir Matthew Hale and <num value="17">seventeen</num> other judges sate after the Great Fire to adjudicate upon the perplexed claims of landlords and tenants in the destroyed houses--a task which they accomplished so much to the satisfaction of every <num value="1">one</num> concerned that their portraits are all preserved in <placeName key="cruch,Guildhall">Guildhall</placeName> in honour of patient justice.</p> 
    <p>Farther down <placeName key="bart,Chancery Lane">Chancery Lane</placeName>, on the same side, is an old dingy courtyard containing the <rs type="Subject">Rolls Court</rs> and <hi rend="italics">Chapel.</hi>
The latter was originally built in the time of Henry III., but rebuilt by Inigo Jones in <dateStruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></dateStruct>, when Dr. Donne preached the consecration sermon. Bishop Atterbury and Bishop Butler were Preachers at the Rolls, and also Bishop Burnet, who was dismissed on account of the offence given <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> to King and Court, by his preaching a sermon here on the text, <quote>Save me from the lion's mouth; thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</quote>
</p><p>It is little known that within the walls of this ugly chapel is <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest pieces of sculpture which England possesses, a tomb which may be compared for beauty with the famous monuments of Francesco Albergati at Bologna, <figure id="Fig.010" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.033.DO01.00010"><head>The Torregiano Tomb, Rolls Chapel</head></figure> and of Bernardo Guigni in the Badia at Florence. The visitor will at once be struck by the contrast of the tomb of Dr. John Young, Master of the Rolls in the time of Henry VIII., with the usual types of English monuments. The aged Master reposes in the most sublime serenity of death upon a sarcophagus, shaped like a Florentine <quote>bridechest,</quote> within a circular arch, on the back of which the <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> half figure of the Saviour rises in low relief between <num value="2">two</num> cherubim. In the panel of the pedestal beneath is the inscription and the date MDXVI. The whole is the work of the immortal <hi rend="italics">Torregiano</hi>, who was the sculptor of Henry VII.'s tomb, and words would fail to give an idea of the infinite repose which he has here given to the venerable features of the dead.   Another stately monument on the same side of--the chapel commemorates Lord Bruce of Kinloss (<dateStruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></dateStruct>), who was sent to open a secret correspondence with Cecil, under the pretence of congratulating Elizabeth on the failure of the revolt under Lord Essex, and who was afterwards rewarded by James I. with the Mastership of the Rolls.   In front kneel his <num value="4">four</num> children.   The eldest son, in armour, was the Lord Bruce of Kinloss who was killed in a duel with Sir Edward Sackville. On the opposite side of the altar is the tomb of Sir Richard Allington, of Horseheath (<dateStruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></dateStruct>): he kneels with his wife at an altar on which their <num value="3">three</num> daughters are represented. Amongst other Masters buried here are Sir John Strange, of whom Pennant gives the gunning epitaph-

  <p>In passing the site of <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName> we are in the City of London.   It separates the City from the Shire, in allusion to which <quote><placeName key="cruch,Shire lane">Shire Lane</placeName></quote> (destroyed by the New Law Courts) was the nearest artery on its north-western side. We enter <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName></rs>, which; like Fleet Market and Fleet Ditch, takes its name from the once rapid and clear, but now fearfully polluted river Fleet, which has its source far away in the breezy heights of Hampstead, and flows through the valley where <placeName key="bart,Farringdon Street">Farringdon Street</placeName> now is, in which it once turned the mills which are still commemorated in <placeName key="bart,Turnmill Street">Turnmill Street</placeName>. Originally (r <num value="2">2</num> <num value="8">8</num>) it was called the <quote>River of Wells,</quote> being fed by the clear springs now known as Sadler's Wells, <placeName key="cruch,Bagnigge wells">Bagnigge Wells</placeName>, and the Clerks' Well or Clerkenwell, and it was navigable for a short distance. The river was ruined as the town extended westwards. Ben Jonson graphically describes in verse the horrors to which the increasing traffic had subjected the still open Fleet in his day, and Gay, Swift, and Pope also denounce them; but in <dateStruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></dateStruct> the stream   was arched over, and since then has sunk to the level of being recognised <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> as the most important sewer--the Cloaca Maxima-of London.
</p><p>Having always been considered as the chief approach to the City, <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> is especially connected with its ancient pageants. All the Coronation processions passed through it, on their way from the Tower to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>: but perhaps the most extraordinary sight it ever witnessed was in <dateStruct value="1448--"><year reg="1448">1448</year></dateStruct>, when Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester, aunt of King Henry VI., was forced to walk bare-headed through it to <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName> with a lighted taper in her hand, in penance for having made a wax figure of the young king and melted it before a slow fire, praying that his life might melt with the wax.</p> 
    <p>Just within the site of <placeName key="cruch,Temple bar">Temple Bar</placeName>, on the right of the street, is <rs type="Subject">Child's Bank</rs>, which deserves notice as the oldest Banking house in England, still kept where Francis Child, an industrious apprentice of Charles I.'s time, married the rich daughter of his master, William Wheeler the goldsmith, and founded the great banking family. Here <quote>at the sign of the Marygold</quote> --the quaint old emblem of the expanded flower with the motto <quote lang="FR">Ainsi mon ame,</quote> which still adorns the banking-office and still appears in the water-mark of the bank-cheques-Charles II. kept his great account and Nell Gwynne her small <num value="1">one</num>, not to speak of Prince Rupert, Pepys, Dryden, and many others.

 The members of this club all had their portraits painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller for Jacob Tonson, their secretary, and the half-size then chosen by the artist has always since caused the term <quote>Kit Kat</quote> to be applied to that form of portrait.

</p><p>As we pass the angle of <placeName key="bart,Chancery Lane">Chancery Lane</placeName> we must recollect that the gentle Izaak Walton lived as a hosier and shirtmaker in the corner house from <dateStruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></dateStruct>, and that, just beyond, in the bow-windowed house which is still standing (No. <num value="184">184</num>, <num value="185">185</num>), lived the poet Drayton. In a house close by, now demolished, Abraham   Cowley was born in I <num value="68">68</num>, being the son of a grocer, and studied, as a child, the large copy of Spenser's <title>Faery Queen </title> which lay on his mother's window-sill, till he became, as he himself narrates- <quote>irrecoverably a poet.</quote></p> 
      <p>The chief feature of <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> as seen on entering it, is the <rs type="Subject">Church of St. Dunstan in the West</rs>, built by <hi rend="italics">Shaw</hi>, <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, on the site of the church in which the great Lord Strafford was baptized.

 It was here that Baxter was preaching when there arose an out-cry that the building was falling. He was silent for a moment, and then said solemnly, <quote>We are in God's service, to prepare ourselves that we may be fearless at the great noise of the dissolving world, when the heavens shall <pb id="p.107" n="107"/> pass away, and the elements melt with fervent heat.</quote> <note id="n.107.1">Bates's <title>Funeral Sermon for Baxter.</title></note>   In the middle of the last century the church became well known from   the lectures of William Romaine, author of
<title>The Life, the Walk, and the Triumph of Faith.</title> When he preached, the crowds were so great as entirely to block up the street. The opposition of the rector, who placed all possible hindrances in his way, and prevented his having more than a single- candle, which he held in his hand during his sermon, only secured for him the firmer support of the people.</p> 
      <p>Over the side entrance towards the street is a <rs type="Subject">Statue of  Queen Elizabeth</rs> holding the orb and sceptre, which is of much interest as having survived the Great Fire of London, when the building in which it stood was consumed, and as <num value="1">one</num> of the few existing relics of the old city gates, for it formerly adorned the west front of Ludgate, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> ancient entrances to the city.</p>

     <p><num value="1">One</num> of the streets which open upon the right of <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> still bears the name of <rs type="Subject">Whitefriars</rs>, which it derives from the convent of the Brotherhood of the Virgin of Mount Carmel, founded   by Sir Richard   Grey in <dateStruct value="1241--"><year reg="1241">1241</year></dateStruct>.<note id="n.114.1">It contained the tombs of Sir Robert Knolles, the builder of Rochester Bridge, celebrated in the French wars (<dateStruct value="1407--"><year reg="1407">1407</year></dateStruct>); of Robert Mascall, Bishop of Hereford, who built the choir and steeple (<dateStruct value="1416--"><year reg="1416">1416</year></dateStruct>); of William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury and King of Man, killed in a tournament at Windsor (<dateStruct value="1343--"><year reg="1343">1343</year></dateStruct>); and of Stephen Patrington, Confessor of Henry IV. and Bishop of St. David's and Chichester (<dateStruct value="1417--"><year reg="1417">1417</year></dateStruct>). King Henry VIII. gave the chapter-house of Whitefriars to his physician, Dr. Butts, the enemy of Cranmer.</note>     The establishment of <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest Theatres in London in the monastic hall of Whitefriars was probably due to the fact of its being a sanctuary beyond the jurisdiction of the Mayor and Corporation, who   then and ever since have opposed theatrical performances within the City. The <num value="1">first</num> playhouse was at Blackfriars, and Whitefriars followed in <dateStruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></dateStruct>.   After the Dissolution, this   district retained   the privilege of sanctuary, and thus it became the refuge for troops of bad characters of every description. It obtained the name of Alsatia, a name which is <num value="1">first</num> found in Shadwell's Play, <title>The Squire of Alsatia,</title> and   to which Sir Walter Scott has imparted especial interest through <quote>The <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> Fortunes of Nigel.</quote> In the reign of James I., almost as much sensation was created here by a singular crime in high life, as in Paris by the murder of the Duchesse de Praslin in our own   time. Young Lord Sanquhar had his eye put out while taking lessons in fencing from John Turner, the famous fencing-master of the day. Being afterwards in France, the young King Henry IV., after inquiring kindly about his accident, said condolingly but jokingly, and <quote>does the man who did it still live?</quote> From   that time it became a monomania with Lord Sanquhar to compass the   death   of the unfortunate Turner, though <num value="2">two</num> years elapsed before he was able to accomplish it-<num value="2">two</num> years in which he dogged his unconscious victim like a shadow, and eventually had him shot by <num value="2">two</num> hired assassins at a tavern which he frequented in Whitefriars. The deputy murderers were arrested, and then Lord Sanquhar surrendered to the mercy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, but he was sentenced to death, and was hung before the entrance of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Hall.</p> 
     <p>Bordering on Alsatia is <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="bart,Salisbury Court">Salisbury Court</placeName></rs>, marking the site of the town-house of the Bishops of Salisbury.

Dryden describes it as <quote>like Nero's palace, shining all with gold.</quote> It faced the river and had a <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> landing-place for those who came by water, and a quaint front resting on open arches. Pepys was a great admirer of the performances at The Duke's Theatre.   Here he saw <title>The Bondsman </title>- <quote>an excellent play and well done,</quote> and here he reports that while he was watching Sir W.

It was founded, like <placeName key="cruch,Christ's hospital">Christ's Hospital</placeName>, by King Edward VI., under the <num value="1">first</num> flush of emotion caused by a sermon on Christian charity which he had heard from   Bishop Ridley, who urged that there was <quote>a wide empty house of the King's Majesty, called <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName>, that would wonderfully well serve to lodge Christ in,</quote> and it was used as a refuge for deserted children, long known as <quote><placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName> Boys.</quote> Gradually, from a Reformatory, it became a prison, and the horrors of the <placeName key="cruch,new Bridewell">New Bridewell</placeName> Prison are described by Ward in <title>The London Spy.</title>   The prisoners, both men and women, used to be flogged on the naked back, and the stripes only ceased when the president, who sat with a hammer in his hand, let it fall upon the block before him. <quote>Oh, good Sir Robert, knock; pray, Sir Robert, knock!</quote> became afterwards often a cry of reproach against those who had been imprisoned in <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName>.

It was a difficult task, but the clergyman was equal to the occasion. He wound up a commonplace discourse upon mortality by saying- <quote>I am desired by the will of the deceased to mention her, and to say nothing but what is <hi rend="italics">well</hi> of her. All that I shall say therefore is this--that she was born well, lived well, and died well; for she was born a Creswell, she lived in Clerkenwell, and she died in <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName>.</quote> <note id="n.117.1">In the court-room of the prison hung a huge picture of Edward VI. granting a charter for the endowment of <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName> to the mayor. It was attributed to Holbein, but could not be his, for the simple reason that it represented an event which occurred <num value="10">ten</num> years after his death,</note>
    The prison was, as we have said, founded upon the old place of <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName>, which, in its turn, had occupied the site of the tower of Montfiquet, built by a Norman follower of the Conqueror. The palace embraced courts, cloisters, and gardens, and close against the walls ran the Fleet. It was to this <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName> Palace that Henry VIII., after he had been captivated by Anne Boleyn, summoned the Members of Council, the Lords of the Court, and the Mayor and Aldermen, and communicated to them   that scruples had <quote>long tormented his mind with regard to his marriage with Katherine of Arragon.</quote> Shakspeare makes the   whole <num value="3">third</num> act of his <hi rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>. pass in the palace at <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName>, which is historically correct.   It was there that the unhappy   Katherine   received   Wolsey   and   Campeggio, <quote>having a skein of red silke about her neck, being at work with her maidens.</quote> <note id="n.117.2">Cavendish.</note></p> 
     <p>The name of <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName> comes from   <placeName key="cruch,St. Bride's church">St. Bride's</placeName> or St. Bridget's Well, a holy spring with supposed miraculous <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> powers like that of St. Clement, which we have already noticed in <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName>. The well here, of which Milton certainly drank, has shared the fate of all the other famous wells of London, and has become a pump. <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="cruch,St. Bride's church">St. Bride's Church</placeName></rs> was rebuilt by Wren after the Fire, and its steeple is <num value="1">one</num> of those on which he bestowed particular pains, though it is often not unjustly compared to the slides of a telescope drawn out. It stands effectively at the end of a little entry at the foot of <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, but it should be remembered that, owing to its having been twice struck by lightning, it is somewhat shorn of the lofty proportions which were originally given to it by the great architect (<num value="226">226</num> ft. instead of <num value="234">234</num>). Its bells, put up in <dateStruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></dateStruct>, are dear to the Londoner's soul. Wynkin de Worde, the famous printer, who rose under the patronage of the mother of Henry VII., and published no less than <num value="400">400</num> works, was buried in the old church, which also contained the graves of the poets Sackville (<dateStruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></dateStruct>) and Lovelace (<dateStruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></dateStruct>), and of Sir Richard Baker (<dateStruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></dateStruct>), who died in the <placeName key="cruch,Fleet prison">Fleet prison</placeName>, author of the very untrustworthy <title>Chronicle of the Kings of England,</title> beloved by Sir Roger de Coverley. In the existing building are monuments to Samuel Richardson (<dateStruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></dateStruct>), who is buried here with his wife and family, and to John Nichols, the historian of Leicestershire. John Cardmaker, who suffered for his faith in Smithfield, <dateStruct value="1553-05-30"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="30">30</day>, <year reg="1553">1553</year></dateStruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, was vicar of this church.
</p><p>Here, in the churchyard of St. Bride, still a quiet and retired spot, John Milton came to lodge in <dateStruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></dateStruct> in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Russell a tailor; here he wrote his treatises <quote>Of Reformation,</quote>  <quote>Of Practical Episcopacy,</quote> and others; and here he instructed, and very often whipped, his sister's <pb id="p.119" n="119"/> <num value="2">two</num> boys. <quote>Here,</quote> says Aubrey, <quote>his <num value="1">first</num> wife, Mrs. Mary Powell, a royalist, having been brought up and lived where there was a great deal of company, merriment, and dancing, when she came to live with her husband at Mr. Russell's, found it very solitary; no company came to her, and oftentimes she heard his nephews beaten and cry.</quote> Her parents also, reports Milton's nephew Phillips, <quote>began to repent them   of having matched the eldest daughter of the family to a person so contrary to them in opinion, and thought that it would be a blot on their escutcheon.</quote> At length the poor young wife found married life <quote>so irksome to her, that she went away to her parents at Forest Hill.</quote> This visit was indefinitely prolonged, and the poet's letters remained unanswered.   He sent a messenger to bring her back, who was scornfully dismissed; but after a time Mrs. Milton's jealousy was excited by the belief that the poet was paying attentions to the   beautiful Miss Davis, and she entreated for a reconciliation of her own accord, an event which had a happy result for the Powell family as they were able to take refuge in the house of their republican son-in-law, when the royalist cause became desperate. The poet's royalist wife Mary died in <dateStruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></dateStruct>, leaving her husband, who was then becoming blind, with <num value="3">three</num> little daughters, of whom the eldest was only <num value="6">six</num> years old.
</p><p>It was in defence of this house in <placeName key="cruch,St. Bride's church">St. Bride's</placeName> Churchyard that, on the advance of Prince Rupert's troops after the Battle of Edgehill, Milton wrote his sonnet:

</p><p><placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName> was not the only prison which was waiting on the outskirts of Alsatia for its frequenters. The great prison of the <hi rend="italics">Fleet</hi> was only demolished in <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>, having been <num value="1">first</num> used for those who were condemned by the Star Chamber. It is an evidence of the size of the river Fleet in old days, difficult as it is to believe possible now, that the prisoners used to be brought from <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName> by water, and landed at a gate upon the Fleet like the Traitor's Gate upon the Thames at the Tower.   It was here that poor old Bishop Hooper was imprisoned (<dateStruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></dateStruct>) before he was sent to be burnt at Gloucester, his bed being <quote>a little pad of straw, with a rotten covering,</quote> and here, to use his own words, he <quote>moaned, called, and cried for help</quote> in his desperate sickness, but the Warden charged that none of his men should help him, saying, <quote>Let him   alone, it were a good riddance of him.</quote> Here Prynne was imprisoned for a denunciation of actresses, which was supposed to reflect upon Queen Henrietta Maria, who had lately been <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> indulging in private theatricals at <placeName key="cruch,Somerset house">Somerset House</placeName>, was condemned to pay a fine of <measure key="10000l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, to be burned in the forehead, slit in the nose, and to have his ears cut off. Hence, <num value="6">six</num> years later, for reprinting <num value="1">one</num> of Prynne's books, <quote>free-born John Lilburne</quote> was whipped to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and   then brought back to be imprisoned, till he   was triumphantly   released   by   the Long   Parliament.     The cruelties which were discovered to have been practised in the Fleet led, in <dateStruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></dateStruct>, to the trial of its gaoler, Bambridge, for murder, when horrors were disclosed   which appalled all who heard of them.   Bambidge was found to have frequently beguiled unwary and innocent persons to the prison gate-house, and then seized and manacled them   without any authority whatever, and kept them there until he had extorted a ransom.   In several cases the prisoners were tortured, in others they were left for so many days without food that they died from inanition, in others Bambidge having ordered his men to stab them with their bayonets, they perished from   festered wounds.   Hogarth <num value="1">first</num> rose to celebrity by his picture of the <placeName key="cruch,Fleet prison">Fleet Prison</placeName> Committee. Horace Walpole describes it:
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">The scene is the committee. On the table are the instruments of torture. A prisoner in rags, half-starved, appears before them. The poor man has a good countenance, that adds to the interest. On the other hand is the inhuman gaoler. It is the very figure that Salvator Rosa would have drawn for Iago in the moment of detection. Villainy, fear, and conscience are mixed in yellow and livid on his countenance. His lips are contracted by tremor, his face advances as eager to lie, his legs step back as thinking to make his escape. <num value="1">One</num> hand is thrust precipitately into his bosom, the fingers of the other are catching uncertainly at his button-holes. If this was a portrait, it is the most striking that ever was drawn; if it was not, it is still finer.</quote>
 <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> The formation of the Fleet Committee found a more lasting eulogium in the lines in Thomson's <title>Winter.</title>

</p><p>The precincts of the prison were long celebrated for the notorious <quote>Fleet Marriages,</quote> which were performed, without license or publication of banns, by a set of vicious clergymen confined in the prison for debt, and therefore free from   fear of the fine of <measure key="100l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="100">100</num></measure> usually inflicted on clergymen convicted of solemnising clandestine marriages.

Pennant, walking past the Fleet in his youth, was often tempted with the question, <quote>Sir, will you be pleased to walk in and be married?</quote> In the curious poem called
<title>The Humours of the Fleet </title> we read-

  <p>We have now arrived where, black and grand, <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</placeName></rs> occupies the platform on the top of the hill. Sublimely grandiose in its general outlines, it has a peculiar sooty dignity all its own, which, externally, raises it immeasurably above the fresh modern-looking <placeName key="cruch,St. Peter's church">St. Peter's</placeName> at Rome. As G. A. Sala says, in <num value="1">one</num> of his capital papers, it is really the better for <quote>all the incense which all the chimneys since the time of Wren have offered at its shrine, and are still flinging up every day from their foul and grimy censers.</quote> Here and there only is the original grey of the stone seen through the overlying blackness, which in early spring is intensified by the green grass and trees of the churchyard which surrounds the eastern part of the building. When you are near it, the mighty dome is lost, but you have always an inward all-pervading impression of its existence, as you have seen it a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times rising in dark majesty over the city; or as, lighted up by the sun, it is sometimes visible from the river, when all minor objects are obliterated in mist. And, apart from the dome, the noble proportions of every pillar and cornice of the great church cannot fail to strike those who linger to look at them, while even the <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> soot-begrimed   garlands, which would be offensive were they clean, have here an indescribable stateliness.

     <p>That the west front of the cathedral does not exactly face <placeName key="bart,Ludgate Hill">Ludgate Hill</placeName> is due to the fact that too many houses were already built to allow of it, the commissioners for reconstructing the city having made their plans before anything was decided   about the new   cathedral.

It must, however, be conceded that the railing was <num value="1">first</num> put up in opposition to the wish of Wren, who objected to its height as concealing the base of the cathedral and the western flight of steps; and that its destruction was chiefly due to the wish of Dean Milman, who abused it as a <quote>heavy, clumsy, misplaced fence.</quote>

</p><p>The <hi rend="italics">Interior</hi> of <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName> is not without a grandeur of its own, but in detail it is bare, cold, and uninteresting, though Wren intended to have lined the dome with mosaics, and to have placed a grand baldacchino in the choir. Though a comparison with <placeName key="cruch,St. Peter's church">St. Peter's</placeName> inevitably forces itself upon those who are familiar with the great Roman basilica, there can scarcely be a greater contrast than between the <num value="2">two</num> buildings. There, all is blazing with precious marbles; here, there is no colour except from the poor glass of the eastern windows, or where a tattered banner waves above a hero's monument.   In the blue depths of the <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> misty dome, the London fog loves to linger, and hides the remains of some feeble frescoes by Thornhill, Hogarth's father-in-law. In <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>, as in <placeName key="cruch,St. Peter's church">St. Peter's</placeName>, the statues on the monuments destroy the natural proportion of the arches by their monstrous size, but they have seldom any beauty or grace to excuse them.

are thinly attended, and, from the nave, it seems as if the knot of worshippers near the choir were lost in the immensity, and the peals of the organ and the voices of the choristers were vibrating through an arcaded solitude. In <dateStruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></dateStruct>, Dr. Newton, as Dean of <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's cathedral">St. Paul's</placeName>, conceded to the wish of Sir Joshua Reynolds, then President of the Academy, that the unsightly blank spaces on the walls of the cathedral should be filled with works by academicians. Sir Joshua himself promised the Nativity, West the Delivery of the Law by Moses.   Barry, Dance, Cipriani, and Angelica Kaufmann were selected by the Academy for the other works. But when Dr. Terrick, then Bishop of London, heard of the intention, he peremptorily refused his consent. -- <quote>Whilst I live and have the power,</quote> he wrote to Bishop Newton, <quote>I will never suffer the doors of the Metropolitan Church to be opened to Popery.</quote> It was then proposed only to put up the works of West and Reynolds-the Foundation of the Law and Gospel-over the doors of the north and south aisles, but the concession was absolutely refused, and the cathedral was left in its bareness.<note id="n.139.2">See Leslie and <placeName key="cruch,Taylor's">Taylor's</placeName> <title>Life of Sir J.

The aged Duke lies, like a Scaliger of Verona, deeply sleeping upon a lofty bronze sarcophagus. Around the base are the names of his victories. At the sides of the canopy, which is supported by noble pillars of the best period of the Renaissance, are grand figures in bronze, of  Courage suppressing Cowardice, and Virtue suppressing  Vice.   The whole was to have been surmounted, like the great tomb of Can Grande, by an equestrian statue; but this was opposed by Dean Milman, and the artist, the greatest sculptor of our time, was snatched away before his <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> work was completed, and before England had awaked to realise that it possessed a worthy follower of Michael Angelo.

I would see the dome, instead of brooding like a dead weight over the area below, expanding and elevating the soul towards Heaven. I would see the sullen white of the roof, the arches, the cornices, the capitals, and the walls, broken and relieved by gilding, as we find it by experience the most lasting, as well as the most appropriate decoration.

</p><p><quote>The <num value="2">two</num> naval officers (Westcott and Burgess) are naked, which destroys historic probability; it cannot be a representation of what happened, for no British warriors go naked into battle, or wear sandals or Asiatic mantles.

Having offended alike the lovers of poetry and the lovers of truth, Banks next gave offence to certain grave divines, who noted that the small line of drapery which droops over the shoulder as far as the middle of Captain Burgess,

like the drapery of the young witch of the poet. Banks added a hand-breadth to it with no little reluctance. When churchmen declared themselves satisfied, the ladies thought they might venture to draw near-but the flutter of fans and the averting of faces was prodigious.  That Victory, a modest and well-draped dame, should approach an undrest dying man, and crown him with laurel, might be endured--but how a well-dressed young lady could think of presenting a sword to a naked gentleman went far beyond all their notions of propriety.</quote>

Nobles vied with each other in giving hospitality to those strangers. The Mayor and Aldermen were required (this was at a later period) to provide sweet and convenient lodgings, for them, with fire, candles, and all other necessaries. Excepting the king and his retinue, who had a covered gallery, the congregation, even the Mayor and Aldermen, stood in the open air.
</p><p>Paul's Cross was not only the great scene for the display of <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> eloquence by distinguished preachers; it was that of many public acts, some relating to ecclesiastical affairs, some of mingled cast, some simply political.

The foundation of <placeName key="cruch,Christ's hospital">Christ's Hospital</placeName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the last acts of Edward VI., who died <num value="10">ten</num> days after.

The buildings, which had belonged to the Grey Friars, and which were set apart for this purpose, had been given to the City of London by Henry VIII. at the Dissolution.
</p><p>The monastery of Grey Friars, which was <num value="1">one</num> of the most important religious houses in London, was founded by the <num value="1">first</num> Franciscans who came over to England in the reign of  Henry III.

It became a favourite burial-place of the queens of England, as well as <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> the usual place of interment for the foreign attendants of the Plantagenet Queens Consort.

Near her was laid Isabel, Countess of Bedford, the eldest and favourite daughter of Edward III., who was separated from her husband Ingelram de Coucy by the wars between France and England. Other tombs were those of Baron Fitzwarren and his wife Isabel, sometime Queen of Man; Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice of England, executed at Tyburn, <dateStruct value="1308--"><year reg="1308">1308</year></dateStruct>; Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, beheaded <dateStruct value="1329--"><year reg="1329">1329</year></dateStruct>; John Philpot, Lord Mayor, <dateStruct value="1384--"><year reg="1384">1384</year></dateStruct>; Sir Nicholas Brember, Lord Mayor, <dateStruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></dateStruct>; John, Duc de Bourbon, taken prisoner at Agincourt, who died after a captivity of eighteen years, <dateStruct value="1433--"><year reg="1433">1433</year></dateStruct>; and Thomas Burdett, <dateStruct value="1477--"><year reg="1477">1477</year></dateStruct>, who was beheaded for having too vigorously lamented over a favourite buck of his, which had been killed by Edward IV.

Dickens describes its miseries in his picture of Smithfield in <title>Oliver Twist</title>--
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">It was market morning, the ground was covered nearly ankle-deep with filth and mire, and a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary ones as could be <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; and tied up to posts by the gutter-side were long lines of oxen, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> deep. Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a dense mass. The whistling of drovers, the barking of dogs, the bellowing and plunging of beasts, the bleating of sheep, and grunting and squeaking of pigs; the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides, the ringing of bells, and the roar of voices that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping, and yelling, the hideous and discordant din that resounded from every corner of the market, and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng, rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confused the senses.</quote>

</p><p>The market for living animals in Smithfield was abolished in <dateStruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct>, when the new   Meat-Market was built.

</p><p>In the open space now   occupied by the market tournaments were formerly held.   Edward III., forgetting his good queen Philippa, shocked London by parading her maid Alice Pierce as his mistress, as <quote>the Lady of the Sun,</quote> at a   public tournament in   Smithfield   in <dateStruct value="1374--"><year reg="1374">1374</year></dateStruct>.

</p><p>Of the long line of sufferers for the Protestant faith, generally on the question of transubstantiation, in the reign of Henry VIII., perhaps the   most remarkable was Sir William Askew's beautiful daughter Anne, whom Wriothesley, the Lord Chancellor, tortured with his own hands, and who lost the use of her feet by her extreme sufferings upon the rack to make her disclose the name of those court ladies of Queen Katherine Parr who shared her opinions. The account in   Foxe   of   her death   is   too   pictorial to omit.
   <quote rend="blockquote"><p>The day of her execution (<dateStruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></dateStruct>) being appointed, this good woman was brought into Smithfield in a chair, because she could not go on her feet, by means of her great torments. When she was brought unto the stake, she was tied by the middle with a chain, that held up her body. When all things were thus prepared to the fire, Dr. Shaxton,<note id="n.177.1">The renegade Bishop of Salisbury.</note> who was then appointed to preach, began his sermon. Anne Askew, hearing and answering again unto him, when he said well, confirmed the same; when he said amiss,  <quote> There,</quote>  said she,  <quote> he misseth, and speaketh without the book.</quote>
</p><p>The sermon being finished, the martyrs, standing there tied at <num value="3">three</num> several stakes ready to their martyrdom, began their prayers.  The multitude and concourse of the people was exceeding; the place <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> where they stood being railed about to keep out the press. Upon the bench under St. Bartholomew's Church sate Wriothesley, chancellor of England; the old Duke of Norfolk, the old Earl of Bedford, the Lord Mayor, with divers others. Before the fire should be set unto them, <num value="1">one</num> of the bench, hearing that they had gunpowder about them, and being alarmed lest the faggots, by strength of the gunpowder, would come flying about their ears, began to be afraid; but the Earl of Bedford, declaring unto him how the gunpowder was not laid under the faggots, but only about their bodies, to rid them out of their pain; which having vent, there was no danger to them of the faggots, so diminished that fear.
</p><p>Then Wriothesley, lord chancellor, sent to Anne Askew letters, offering her the king's pardon if she would recant; who, refusing once to look upon them, made this answer again, that she came not thither to deny her Lord and Master. Then were the letters likewise offered to the others, who, in like manner, following the constancy of the woman, denied not only to receive them, but also to look upon them. Whereupon the Lord Mayor, commanding fire to be put unto them, cried with a loud voice, <foreign lang="LA">Fiat Justitia!</foreign>
</p><p>And thus the good Anne Askew, with these blessed martyrs, being troubled so many manner of ways, and having passed through so many torments, now ended the long course of her agonies, being compassed in with flames of fire.</p></quote>
</p><p>With the reign of Mary, who was educated in cruelty by her husband Philip, the executions for religion became <num value="10">ten</num> times more frequent than before. The martyr-procession was heralded (<dateStruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></dateStruct>) by John Rogers, Vicar of St. Sepulchre's, who had been converted to the Protestant faith at Antwerp by conversations with William Tyndall and Miles Coverdale.

<p>Rogers was offered a pardon if. he would revoke his expressions   about transubstantiation, but he   answered, <quote>That which I have preached will I seal with my blood; at the day of Judgement it will be known whether I am   a heretic,</quote> and, being bound to the stake, washed his hands in the flame, as <num value="1">one</num> feeling no hurt, and so died bravely in sight of his own church-tower. <quote>He was,</quote> says Foxe, <quote>the proto-martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time, that gave the <num value="1">first</num> adventure upon the fire.</quote>
</p><p>To those who study the story of the executions in Smithfield it will be striking, how, in the midst of a Catholic population, the English feeling of injustice towards the victims, and indignation at the cruelty of their persecutors, especially against Bonner, Bishop of London, always made the spectators sympathize with the sufferers, and only fear lest they should be induced by terror to recant at the last.  Thus, when John Cardmaker, Prebendary of Wells, was brought to Smithfield (<dateStruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></dateStruct>) with John Warne an upholsterer of <placeName key="cruch,Walbrook">Walbrook</placeName>-
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">The people were in a marvellous dump and sadness thinking that Cardmaker would recant at the burning of Warne.

The people seeing this so suddenly done, contrary to their fearful expectation, as men delivered out of a great doubt, cried out with joy, saying, <quote> God be praised <num value="1">1</num> the Lord strengthen thee, Cardmaker; the Lord Jesus receive thy spirit!</quote>  </quote>
</p><p>Amongst the most remarkable of the after sufferers was John Bradford, who died embracing the stake and comforting his fellow sufferer; and John Philpot, Archdeacon of <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> Winchester, who knelt, like St. Andrew, at <num value="1">first</num> sight of his stake.
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">And when he was come to the place of suffering, he kissed the stake, and said,  <quote> Shall I disdain to suffer at this stake, seeing my Redeemer did not refuse to suffer a most vile death upon the cross for me?</quote>  And then with an obedient heart full meekly he said the <num value="106">106</num>th, the <num value="107">107</num>th, and the <num value="108">108</num>th Psalms. . . .

   <quote rend="blockquote"><p>The death-day of the founder is still kept solemnly by the Cistercians. In their chapel, where assemble the boys of the school, and the fourscore old men of the hospital, the founder's tomb stands--a huge edifice, emblazoned with heraldic decorations and clumsy carved allegories. There is an old hall, a beautiful specimen of the architecture of James's time. An old hall P Many old halls, old staircases, old passages, old chambers decorated with old portraits, walking in the midst of which we walk, as it were, in the early <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century.

Before marching from the oration-hall to chapel, the stewards of the day's dinner, according to old-fashioned rite, have wands put into their hands, walk to church at the head of the procession, and sit there in places of honour. The boys are already in their seats, with smug fresh faces, and shining white collars; the old black-gowned pensioners are on their benches, the chapel is lighted, and the founder's tomb, with its grotesque carvings, monsters, heraldries, darkles and shines with the most wonderful shadows and lights. There he lies, Fundator Noster, in his ruff and gown, awaiting the Great Examination Day. We oldsters, be we ever so old, become boys again as we look at that familiar old tomb, and think how the seats are altered since we were here, and how the doctor--not the present doctor, the doctor of <hi rend="italics">our</hi> time-used to sit yonder, and his awful eye used to frighten us shuddering boys, on whom it lighted; and how the boy next us <hi rend="italics">would</hi> kick our shins during service time, and how the monitor would cane us afterwards because our shins were kicked.

(<dateStruct value="1100--"><year reg="1100">1100</year></dateStruct>) by a baron named Jordan Briset and Muriel his wife, and was consecrated in <dateStruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></dateStruct> by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (buried in the Temple Church), who here urged Henry to undertake a crusade, and fell into a great rage on his refusal. John knighted Alexander of Scotland here, and Edward I. came hither to spend his honeymoon with Eleanor. This early Priory was so large that, when it was burnt by the rebels under Wat Tyler, the conflagration lasted <num value="7">seven</num> days. All the other houses of the knights in London were destroyed by the insurgents at the same time, and the prior, Sir Robert Hales, was beheaded, in revenge for his having advised the king (Richard II.) to make no terms with the commons. The Priory, however, was soon rebuilt, and Henry IV. and V. frequently stayed there, and it was there that-finding how ill it would be received by the people of England-Richard III. gave a public denial to the rumours of his intended marriage with his niece Elizabeth of York. The Order of St. John was suppressed by Henry VIII. on pretext that the knights denied his supremacy, <num value="2">two</num> of those who opposed him being beheaded, and a <num value="3">third</num> hung and quartered. But the Priory still continued to be the resort of royalty, and Mary resided here frequently during the reign of Edward VI., and rode hence to pay state visits to her brother, attended by a great troop of Catholic ladies and gentlemen. The buildings of the Priory perished for the most part when they were blown up by the Protector Somerset, who intended to use them in building his palace in <placeName key="bart,The Strand">the Strand</placeName>.</p>

The accounts which he gave of the marvellous powers of his friend Garrick inspired Cave with a desire to see him act, and in the old room, which is now the dining-hall of the tavern, Garrick is said <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> to have made his debut before a select audience in Fielding's

 <hi rend="italics">audition</hi>. It was supposed that the spirit of a young lady poisoned by a lover to whom   she had bequeathed her <figure id="Fig.029" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.033.DO01.00029"><head>Crypt of St. John's, Clerkenwell.</head></figure>property, came to visit, invisibly, but with very mysterious noises, a girl named Parsons who lived in <placeName key="bart,Cock Lane">Cock Lane</placeName>  (between Smithfield and <placeName key="bart,Holborn">Holborn</placeName>) and was daughter to the clerk of St. Sepulchre's Church.   Horace Walpole went to see the victim, with the Duke of York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke, and Lord Hertford, but after waiting till half-past <num value="1">one</num> in the morning in a suffocating room with <num value="50">fifty</num> people crowded into it, he was told that <pb id="p.205" n="205"/> the ghost would not come that night till <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning, <quote>when,</quote> says Walpole, <quote>there were only prentices and old women.</quote> At length, the ghost having promised, by an affirmative knock, that she would attend any <num value="1">one</num> of her visitors in the vaults of <placeName key="cruch,St. John's church">St. John's Church</placeName>, and there knock upon her coffin, an investigation was made, of which Dr. Johnson, who was present, has left a description:--
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">About <num value="10">ten</num> at night, the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl, supposed to be disturbed by a spirit, had with proper caution been put to bed by several ladies. They sate rather more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went down-stairs, where they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied in the strongest terms any knowledge or belief of fraud. While they were inquiring and deliberating, they were summoned into the girl's chamber by some ladies who were near her bed, and who had heard knocks and scratches. When the gentlemen entered, the girl declared that she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back, when the spirit was very solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance, by impression on the hand or body of any present, or any other agency; but no evidence of any preternatural power was exhibited. The spirit was then very seriously advertised that the person to whom the promise was made of striking the coffin was then about to visit the vault, and that the performance of the promise   was them claimed. The company at <num value="1">one</num> o'clock went into the church, and the gentleman to whom the promise was made went with another into the vault. The spirit was solemnly required to perform its promise, but nothing more than silence ensued; the person supposed to be accused by the spirit then went down with several others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return they examined the girl, but could draw no confession from her. Between <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> she desired and was permitted to go home with her father. It is therefore the opinion of the whole assembly that the child has some art of making or counterfeiting a particular noise, and that there is no agency of any higher cause.</quote>
</p><p>The failure of the investigation led to the discovery that the father of the girl who was the supposed   object of spiritual visitation had arranged the plot in order to frighten the man accused of murder into remitting a loan which he <pb id="p.206" n="206"/> had received from him whilst he was lodging in his house. Parsons was imprisoned for a year, and placed <num value="3">three</num> times in the pillory, where, however, instead of maltreating him, the London mob raised a subscription in his favour. The account of the nocturnal expedition of Dr. Johnson and his friends to the crypt caused great amusement; which was enhanced by the appearance of Churchill's poem   of <title>The Ghost.</title>

The account which Stow gives of the after-adventures of the head is too curious to omit.
</p><p> <quote>After the Battle of Flodden, the body of King James being found, was enclosed in lead, and conveyed from thence to London, and so to the monastery of Shene in Surrey where it remained for a time, in what order I am not certain; but since the dissolution of that house in the reign of Edward IV., Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, being lodged and keeping house there, I have been shown the same body so lapped in lead, close to the head and body, thrown into a waste room amongst the old timber, lead, and other nibble.   Since which time, workmen there, <pb id="p.229" n="229"/> for their foolish pleasure, hewed off his head; and Lancelot Young, master-glazier to her Majesty, feeling a sweet savour to come from thence, and seeing the same dried from all moisture, and yet the form remaining, with the hair of the head, and the beard red, brought it to London, to his house in <placeName key="cruch,Wood street">Wood Street</placeName>, where for a time he kept it for its sweetness, but in the end caused the sexton of that church to bury it amongst other bones taken out of their charnel,</quote> --<hi rend="italics">Stow</hi>, p. <num value="112">112</num>.

     <p>The <num value="1">first</num> <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="cruch,Royal Exchange">Royal Exchange</placeName></rs> was built by Sir Thomas Gresham, the great merchant-prince of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. Under Edward VI. and Mary he had been employed as a confidential agent in obtaining subsidies from great foreign merchants, and under Elizabeth took advantage of his increasing favour to enforce the benefit of obtaining loans from wealthy Englishmen rather than foreigners. Treated with the utmost confidence by Elizabeth, he was made <quote>Sir Thomas</quote> when employed as ambassador to the Duchess of Parma. He continued to keep his shop in <placeName key="bart,Lombard Street">Lombard Street</placeName>, distinguished by the sign of the grasshopper, the Gresham crest, but in the country lived with great magnificence at Mayfield in Sussex (previously a palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury), and at Osterley in Middlesex. He died of an apoplectic fit as he was walking from his house in <placeName key="bart,Bishopsgate Street">Bishopsgate Street</placeName> to the Exchange, <dateStruct value="1579-11-21"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg="21">21</day>, <year reg="1579">1579</year></dateStruct>
</p><p>The idea of the Exchange originated with Sir Richard Gresham, father of Sir Thomas, who wished to see English merchants as well lodged as those whom   he had been accustomed to see in the magnificent Bourse at Antwerp. And how much something of the kind was needed in London we learn from Stow, who says, <quote>The merchants and tradesmen, as well English as strangers, did for their general making of bargains, contracts and commerce, usually meet twice a day.   But these meetings were unpleasant and troublesome, by reason of walking and talking in an open narrow street . . . being there constrained either to endure all extremes of weather, viz. heat or cold, snow or rain; or else to shelter themselves in shops.</quote>
</p><p>The <num value="1">first</num> Exchange, therefore, was built as much as <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> possible on the plan of that at Antwerp. A Flemish architect, Henryke, was appointed, and all the materials were brought from Flanders, much to the disgust of English masons and bricklayers. The result was that the Exchange, which was opened by Elizabeth in <dateStruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></dateStruct>, was foreign-looking to the last degree. It was an immense cloistered court, with a corridor filled with shops running above its arcades, called a <quote>pawn,</quote> from the German word <quote>bahn</quote> --a way. In front rose an immense column surmounted by the grasshopper of the Greshams. Over the pillars round the quadrangle, which were all of marble, were statues of the sovereigns from the Confessor to Elizabeth. Immediately on the execution of Charles I. his statue was thrown down, and in its plate was inscribed, <quote lang="LA">Exit tyrannus, regum ultimus, anno libertatis Anglia restitutae primo.</quote>   The Exchange of Gresham was totally destroyed in the Great Fire of <dateStruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></dateStruct>. Wren then wished in restoring it to make the Exchange the centre of the new London, from which all the principal streets should diverge. His wish was opposed, and the new building was built much in the same style as the old, but with greater magnificence, by Edward Jarman, and was adorned with statues by Cibber.
</p><p>The <num value="2">second</num> Exchange was burnt in <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>, and the statues which survived the fire were for the most part sold as lumber!   The present building by <hi rend="italics">Tile</hi>, stately, though inferior to its predecessor, was opened in <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>. It encloses a large cloistered court, with a statue of Queen Victoria in the centre. The statue of Charles II. by <hi rend="italics">Gibbons</hi>, which formerly occupied that position, is preserved at the southeast angle. The inscription on the pedestal of the figure of  Commerce on the front of the building-- <quote>The Earth is the <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> Lord's, and the fulness thereof,</quote> was selected by Dean Milman on hearing the suggestion of the Prince Consort to Mr. Westmacott that the space should be used for some inscription recognising a Superior Power.
</p><p>The busiest time at the Exchange, when it is most worth seeing, is from <num value="3">3</num> to <num value="4">4</num> P.M. on Tuesdays and Fridays. The eastern part of the building is occupied by <hi rend="italics">Lloyd's</hi>, the great rendezvous of ship-owners, and all who seek shipping intelligence. The name originated in the early transaction of the business at Lloyd's Coffee House, at the corner of <placeName key="bart,Abchurch Lane">Abchurch Lane</placeName>.

</p><p>This quarter derives its appellation from having been, in ancient times, the residence of the Dukes of Brittany.

The lanes and courts also contain many smaller houses, not on so grand a scale, but, like your small gentry, sturdily maintaining their claims to equal antiquity. These have their gable ends to the street; great bow windows, with diamond panes set in lead; grotesque carvings, and low-arched doorways.<note id="n.261.1">There are still such houses in the neighbouring <placeName key="bart,Cloth Fair">Cloth Fair</placeName>.</note>   <placeName key="bart,Little Britain">Little Britain</placeName> may truly be called the heart's core of the City; the stronghold of true John Bullism.

The rich Mayor of London, Sir John Spencer, bought Crosby Place in <dateStruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></dateStruct>, and during his occupation M. de Rosny, afterwards Duc de Sully, the minister of Henry IV., was received here as ambassador, when he came over to persuade James I. to preserve the league which had existed between Elizabeth, France, and the Hollanders, and not to make war with Catholic Spain. In his Memoirs he gives a curious account of a scene which occurred here in the great hall during his visit. Previous ambassadors had brought great disrepute upon their country through the excesses committed in London by members of their suite, and of these he was determined to prevent a recurrence. To his horror, upon the very evening of his arrival, he discovered that <num value="1">one</num> of his attendants, going out to amuse himself, had murdered an English merchant in a brawl in Great St. Helen's.   He immediately made the whole of his companions and servants range themselves against the wall; and taking a lighted flambeau, he walked up to each in turn, and, throwing the light full upon them, scrutinised their faces. By his trembling and his livid paleness it was soon disclosed that a noble young gentleman, son of the Sieur de Combaut, was the culprit. He was related to the French Ambassador M. de Beaumont, who demanded, urged, and entreated his pardon, but in vain. Sully declared that Combaut should be beheaded in a few minutes. He was finally induced to give him up to the Mayor, who saved his life; but his severity, says Sully, had this consequence, that <quote>the English began to love, and the French to fear him more.</quote>
</p><p>Sir John Spencer, having but a poor opinion of the Compton family in that day, positively forbade the <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="p.285" n="285"/> Earl of Northampton to pay his addresses to his daughter, who was the greatest heiress in England. <num value="1">One</num> day, at the foot of the staircase, Sir John met the baker's boy with his covered barrow, and, being pleased at his having come punctually when he was ordered, he gave him sixpence; but the baker's boy was Lord Northampton in disguise, and in the covered barrow   he was carrying off the beautiful Elizabeth Spencer.   When he found how he had been duped, Sir John swore that Lord Northampton had seen the only sixpence of his money he should ever receive, and refused to be reconciled to his daughter. But the next year Queen Elizabeth, having expressed to Sir John Spencer the sympathy which she felt with his sentiments upon the ingratitude of his child, invited him to come and be <quote>gossip</quote> with her to a newly-born baby in which she was much interested, and he could not refuse; and it is easy to imagine whose that baby was. So the Spencer property came to the Comptons after all, and an immense inheritance it has been, and. Lord Northampton lived to erect the magnificent tomb to his <quote>well-deserving father-in-law,</quote> where the disobedient daughter, in everlasting contrition for her fault, may be seen kneeling, in a tremendous hoop, at her father's feet.
</p><p>The rich wife continued to live frequently in Crosby Place, and was rather an expensive wife to her husband, especially considering the value of money at that time, as may be judged from the following letter written soon after her marriage.

</p><p>The church consists of <num value="2">two</num> aisles, separated by perpendicular arches, with chapels attached at the south-east. Only a very small portion of the building is used for congregational purposes, and till a few years ago a large part of the west end, screened off, and always known as <quote>The Void,</quote> was only used for funerals.

Being the property of the Drapers' Company, when a new Master is appointed, he generally pays his respects to Francis  Bancroft, for the tomb can be entered by a door, and the lid of the coffin turns back, displaying the skeleton.  Bancroft was so unpopular as a city magistrate in his life-time, that the people pealed the bells at his funeral, and tried to upset the coffin on its way to the grave.  He desired that for a <num value="100">hundred</num> years a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine might be placed in his grave every year on the anniversary of his death, because he was convinced that before that time he should awake from   his death-sleep and require it. The <num value="100">hundred</num> years have now expired.
</p><p>Beyond Bancroft's tomb are a staircase and a door, which formerly communicated with <num value="2">two</num> stories of the convent.

It is composed in the lowest style of English, without slang or false grammar.  If you were to polish it, you would at once destroy the reality of the vision.

</p><p><quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote>The style of Bunyan is delightful to every reader, and invaluable as a study to every person who wishes to obtain a wide command over the English language. The vocabulary is the vocabulary of the common people. There is not an expression, if we except a few technical terms of theology, which would puzzle the rudest peasant.   We have observed several pages which do not contain a single word of more than <num value="2">two</num> syllables. Yet no writer has said more exactly what he meant to say. For magnificence, for pathos, for vehement exhortation, for subtle disquisition, for every purpose of the poet, the orator, and the divine, this homely dialect, the dialect of plain working-men, was perfectly sufficient. There is no book in our literature on which we could so readily stake the fame of the old unpolluted English language; no book which shews so well how rich that language is in its own proper wealth, and how little it has been improved by all that it has borrowed. . . We are not afraid to say that, though there were many clever men in England during the latter half of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, there were only <num value="2">two</num> great creative minds. <num value="1">One</num> of these minds produced the Paradise Lost, the other the Pilgrim's Progress.</quote><bibl>-T.

Here they found quiet and security, and settled themselves in their several trades and occupations, weavers especially; whereby God's blessing is surely not only brought upon the parish, by receiving poor strangers, but also a great advantage hath accrued to the whole nation, by the rich manufacture of weaving silks, and stuffs, and camlets, which art they brought along with them. And this benefit also to the neighbourhood, that these strangers may serve for pattern of thrifty honesty, industry, and sobriety.</quote> In the year <dateStruct value="1687"><year reg="1687">1687</year></dateStruct> alone, no less than <num value="13500">13,500</num> of these exiles took refuge in England.

Many historic French names are still to be found in the district- Le Sage, Fouchd (Anglicised into Futcher), and Racine, whose possessor declares himself related to the famous dramatist. The mothers of the last generation were often to be seen in their old French costumes, and to this hour thousands work in their glazed attics, such as were used by their forefathers on the other side of the Channel, which give such a characteristic aspect to the neighbourhood.<note id="n.313.1">See the interesting Report of the New Nichol Street Ragged Schools, <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>.</note>

<div1 type="chapter" n="CHAPTER IX: In the Heart of the City" id="c9"><head>Chapter IX: In the Heart of the City.</head>   <p>The labyrinthine but most busy streets which form the centre of the City of London to the south of the <placeName key="cruch,Royal Exchange">Royal Exchange</placeName> are filled with objects of interest, though of minor interest, amid which it will be difficult to thread our way, and impossible to keep up any continuous connection of associations. The houses, which have looked down upon so many generations of toilers, are often curious in themselves. The City churches for the most part are dying a slow   death; their congregations have ebbed and will never flow   back.   Very few   are worth visiting for their own sakes, yet almost every <num value="1">one</num> contains some tomb or other fragment which gives it a historic interest.

   <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><p>There is a pale heap of books in the corner of every pew, and while the organ, which is hoarse and sleepy, plays in such a fashion that I can hear more of the rusty working of the stops than of the music, I look at the books, which are mostly bound in faded baize and stuff. They belonged, in <dateStruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></dateStruct>, to the Dowgate family. And who were they? Jane Comport must have married young Dowgate, and come into the family that way. Young Dowgate was courting Jane Comport when <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> he gave her her prayer-book, and recorded the presentation in the fly leaf. If Jane were fond of young Dowgate, why did she die and leave the book here?   Perhaps at the rickety altar, and before the damp Commandments, she, Comport, had taken him, Dowgate, in a flush of youthful hope and joy, and perhaps it had not turned out in the long run as great a success as was expected.
</p><p> The opening of the service recalls my wandering thoughts. I then find to my astonishment that I have been, and still am, taking a strong kind of invisible snuff up my nose, into my eyes, and down my throat.  I wink, sneeze, and cough. The clerk sneezes; the clergyman winks; the unseen organist sneezes and coughs (and probably winks); all our little party wink, sneeze, and cough. The snuff seems to be made of the decay of matting, wood, cloth, stone, iron, earth, and something else. Is the something else the decay of dead citizens in the vaults below? As sure as death it is! Not only in the cold damp February day, do we cough and sneeze dead citizens, all through the service, but dead citizens have got into the very bellows of the organ and half choked the same. We stamp our feet to warm them, and dead citizens arise in heavy clouds. Dead citizens stick upon the walls, and lie pulverised on the sounding-board over the clergyman's head, and when a gust of air comes, tumble down upon him.</p>

It was in <dateStruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></dateStruct>, while he was living here, that Hogarth made a tapestry design for Morris the upholsterer, for which he was refused payment, and vainly sued for it in the Courts. It is believed that this loss induced him to run so far into debt with his landlord that he consented to wipe off the score with his brush by caricaturing on the wall of the Elephant taproom the parochial authorities who had insulted his landlord by removing the scene of their annual orgie to a tavern (Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>'s Head) opposite, and insulted himself by omitting to send his accustomed invitation.

The effect sometimes is very striking, from the variety of hues and the constant flitting or gathering of the crowd into little groups of bargainers. Gowns of every shade and every pattern are hanging up, but none, perhaps, look either bright or white; it is a vista of dinginess, but many-coloured dinginess, as regards female attire. Dress-coats, frock-coats, greatcoats, livery and game-keepers' coats, paletots, tunics, trowsers, knee. breeches, waistcoats, capes, pilot-coats, working jackets, plaids, hats, dressing-gowns, shirts, Guernsey frocks, are all displayed. The predominant colours are black and blue, but there is every colour; the light dress of some aristocratic livery, the dull brown-green of velveteen, <pb id="p.349" n="349"/> the deep blue of a pilot jacket, the variegated figures of the shawl dressing-gown, the glossy black of the restored garments, the shine of the newly-turpentined black satin waistcoats, the scarlet and green of some flaming tartan-these things, mixed with the hues of the women's garments, spotted and striped, certainly present a scene which cannot be beheld in any other part of the greatest city in the world, nor in any other portion of the world itself.

There is, too, an admixture of men's  <quote>button-boots,</quote>  with drab-cloth legs; and of a few red, yellow, and russet-coloured slippers; and of children's coloured morocco boots and shoes. Handkerchiefs, sometimes of a gaudy orange pattern, are leaped on a chair. Lace and muslin occupy small stands, or are spread on the ground. Black and drab and straw hats are hung up, or piled <num value="1">one</num> upon another, and kept from falling by means of strings; while incessantly threading their way through all this intricacy is a mass of people, some of whose dresses speak of a recent purchase in this lane.</p></quote><bibl>--H.

     <p>Below <placeName key="bart,Tower Hill">Tower Hill</placeName>, separated from it by a wide moat and ramparts now planted with gardens on the side of the town, is the immense pile of fortifications known as the <rs type="Subject"><placeName key="cruch,Tower of London">Tower of London</placeName></rs>. Though <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient, and quite the most historical, of English fortresses, a great feeling of disappointment will be inevitably felt by those who see it for the <num value="1">first</num> time. Its picturesque points have to be carefully sought for. Its general aspect is poor, rrean, and uninteresting, a fault which is entirely owing to the <pb id="p.369" n="369"/> feebleness of our later English architects--to the same utter ignorance of the honour due to light and shadow-and the same sacrifice of general outline to finish, which has ruined Windsor Castle. Here, where an Italian would have used enormous blocks of stone, perfect rocks heaped <num value="1">one</num> upon another, all work of rebuilding or restoration has been done with small stones neatly cut and fitted together like bricks, producing an impression of durable piteousness, which it requires all the romance of history to counteract.

Gundulph, Bishop of Rochester, the builder of Rochester Castle, was overseer of the work. He was surnamed <quote>the Weeper</quote> and appropriately <quote>laid in tears the foundation of the fortress which was to be the scene of so much suffering.</quote> The Tower was much enlarged by William Rufus, of whom Henry of Huntingdon says, <quote>He pilled and shaved the people with tribute, especially to spend about the <placeName key="cruch,Tower of London">Tower of London</placeName> and the great hall of <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</quote> By Rufus and Henry I., St. Thomas's Tower was built over the Traitor's Gate,-- <quote>they caused a grate castle to be builded under the said Tower, to wit on the south side towards the Thames, and also encastelated the same about.</quote> In the reign of Henry I. we read of Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Durham, being imprisoned in the <pb id="p.370" n="370"/> Tower, but a rope was sent to him, concealed in a cask of wine, and he escaped safely, being let down from the walls.
</p><p>King Stephen frequently resided in the Tower.

He <quote>enclosed the castle with an outward wall of stone, thinking to have environed it with the river of Thames.</quote> Of all English sovereigns the Tower was most enriched and adorned by Henry III., for he regarded it rather as a palace than a fortress. Griffin, Prince of Wales, was imprisoned here in <dateStruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></dateStruct> and attempted to escape by a rope made of his bedclothes, but it broke, and he met with a frightful death in the moat. Under Edward I. the great prisoners taken in the Scottish wars were immured here. Baliol, after <num value="3">three</num> years, was released on the intercession of the Pope, but William Wallace and Sir Simon Fraser only left their prison to be executed with the most horrible brutality in Smithfield.
</p><p>Edward II. frequently resided in the Tower, where his eldest daughter, thence called Jane of the Tower, was born. Under Edward III., John, King of France, and David Bruce, King of Scotland, were imprisoned here. In the reign of Richard II. the Tower was continually filled with prisoners who were victims of the jealousy of rival factions, the most illustrious being the young king's tutor, the excellent Sir Simon Burley, of whom Froissart says, <quote>To write of his shameful death right sore displeaseth me; for when I was young I found him a noble knight, sage and wise <gap/> yet no excuse could be heard, and on a day he was brought out of the Tower and beheaded like a traitor-God have mercy on his soul.</quote> For this act, when his own friends <pb id="p.371" n="371"/> obtained the chief power, King Richard caused his uncle the Duke of Gloucester to be put to death at Calais, and the Earl of Arundel lost his head on <placeName key="bart,Tower Hill">Tower Hill</placeName>.
</p><p>During the rebellion of Wat Tyler, when the king, who had previously been fortified in the Tower, was induced to go forth to meet the insurgents, the rebels broke into the fortress and pillaged it, beheading Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury (who had abused them as <quote>shoeless ribalds</quote> ), Sir Robert Hales the treasurer, and others whom   they found there. It was in the upper chamber of the White Tower that Richard II. abdicated in favour of his cousin Henry of Bolingbroke, and hence Henry IV. went to his coronation, a custom   which was followed by all after sovereigns of England till James II.   Henry, Earl of Huntingdon, the king's brother-in-law, was the <num value="1">first</num> of a long series of victims beheaded in the Tower in the reign of Henry IV., in which Prince James of Scotland, son of Robert III., was imprisoned there. Under Henry V. the prisons were filled with the captives of Agincourt, including Charles, Duke of Orleans,<note id="n.371.1">The father (by his <num value="3">third</num> wife) of Louis XII. He had previously married Isabella of Valois, widow of Richard II. of England.</note> and his brother John, Count of Angoulme. In this reign also the Tower became the prison of many of the reformers called Lollards, of whom the greatest was Lord Cobham, who was dragged by a chain from the Tower to be burnt in <placeName key="cruch,St. Giles's church">St. Giles's</placeName> Fields.
</p><p>In the reign of Henry VI. the fortress was occupied by the prisoners of the Wars of the Roses, and here in <dateStruct value="1471-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1471">1471</year></dateStruct>, King Henry VI. died mysteriously just after the Battle of Tewkesbury-according to Fabian and Hall, by the hand of the Duke of Gloucester, who <quote>murthered the <pb id="p.372" n="372"/> said kyng with a dagger.</quote> Queen Margaret was imprisoned here till <dateStruct value="1475"><year reg="1475">1475</year></dateStruct>. <num value="2">Two</num> years afterwards George, Duke of Clarence, brother of Edward IV., was put to death in the Tower.   With the death of Edward IV. the darkest page in the annals of the fortress is opened by the execution of Lord Hastings, soon to be followed by the alleged murder of the young King Edward V., and his brother Richard, Duke of York.
</p><p>Hence Elizabeth of York went to her coronation as wife of Henry VII., and here she died after her confinement in <dateStruct value="1503--"><year reg="1503">1503</year></dateStruct>. Her little daughter Katherine was the last princess born in the Tower. The most illustrious victim of this reign was Edward, Earl of Warwick, son of the murdered Duke of Clarence, and the last male Plantagenet, who was beheaded in <dateStruct value="1499--"><year reg="1499">1499</year></dateStruct>, his only crime being his royal blood. In the same year Perkin Warbeck, the White Rose of England, who claimed to be the younger son of Edward IV., was imprisoned here before being taken to be hung at Tyburn.
</p><p>The accession of Henry VIII. witnessed the imprisonment and execution of Empson and Dudley the taxgatherers of his father, and in <dateStruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></dateStruct> that of Edward Bohun,  Duke of Buckingham, whose chief fault was his descent from Thomas of Woodstock, youngest son of Edward III.  The next great executions on <placeName key="bart,Tower Hill">Tower Hill</placeName> were those of  Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, who suffered for refusing to acknowledge the king's supremacy.  These were soon followed by the private execution of  Queen Anne Boleyn and her brother Lord Rochford, and by the death on <placeName key="bart,Tower Hill">Tower Hill</placeName> of Henry Norris, William  Brereton, Sir Francis Weston, and Mark Smeaton for her <pb id="p.373" n="373"/> sake.   The endless victims of the northern insurrections and of the dissolution of monasteries next succeeded to the prisons of the Tower, followed by those accused of treasonable correspondence with Cardinal Pole, including his venerable mother, Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, niece of the Kings Edward IV. and Richard III., who was brutally beheaded within the walls.   In <dateStruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></dateStruct> Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, the chief promoter of the dissolution of monasteries, who had offended Henry VIII. by bringing about his marriage with Anne of Cleves, was imprisoned and brought to the block.

</p><p>The accession of Mary brought Lady Jane Grey and her husband Lord Guildford Dudley to the Tower and the scaffold, with her father-in-law John Dudley, Duke of  Northumberland, and his adherents Sir John Gates and  Sir Thomas Palmer. The rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt, a principal cause in the execution of Lady Jane Grey, led to his being beheaded, to the execution of the Duke of  Suffolk and Lord Thomas Grey, and to the imprisonment in the Tower of the Princess Elizabeth.
</p><p>The accession of Elizabeth sent a number of Roman  Catholic bishops and abbots to the Tower for refusing to acknowledge her supremacy. Lady Katherine Grey, sister of Lady Jane, was also kept in prison till her death in <dateStruct value="1567--"><year reg="1567">1567</year></dateStruct> for the crime of a secret marriage with the Earl of Hertford.  Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, son of the unfortunate  Earl of Surrey, was imprisoned and executed in <dateStruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></dateStruct>, for having aspired to the hand of Mary, Queen of Scots. In the latter part of the queen's reign numbers of Jesuit priests were committed to the Tower and executed, and Henry  Percy, Earl of Northumberland, being imprisoned there, <pb id="p.375" n="375"/> died by suicide. Sir John Perrot, a natural son of Henry VIII., unjustly imprisoned, died of a broken   heart. Through the bitter jealousy of the reigning court favourites, Cecil and Raleigh, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, was imprisoned and beheaded privately in the Tower in <dateStruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></dateStruct>, his execution being followed by those of Sir Christopher Blunt, Sir Charles Danvers, Sir Gilley Merrick, and Henry Cuffe.
</p><p>Shortly after James I. came to the throne an alleged plot for the re-establishment of popery and raising of Lady Arabella Stuart to the throne led to that lady's imprisonment for life in the Tower (where she died insane) with Lord Thomas Grey and Lord Cobham, and to the execution of George Brook the brother of the latter. Sir Walter Raleigh, imprisoned at the same time (<dateStruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></dateStruct>), was released in <dateStruct value="1616--"><year reg="1616">1616</year></dateStruct>, but he was reimprisoned in <dateStruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></dateStruct> to gratify the malice of Gondomar the Spanish ambassador, and (though he had been appointed admiral of the fleet with command of an expedition to Guiana, during his short interval of liberty) he was beheaded <num value="2">two</num> months afterwards on his old accusation.

   </p><p>The parts of the Tower generally exhibited to the public are the Armoury and the Jewel Tower. These, however, are the parts least worth seeing.

It has been well observed that the dress of the Beefeaters in the Tower shows, more than anything else in London, the reverence of England for her past. Their name is supposed to be derived from the fact that the commons of the early Yeomen of the Guard, when on duty, was beef-an<num value="4">4</num> the name was probably derisory, beef being then a cheap article of consumption, for when under Henry VIII. butchers were compelled by law to sell their mutton at <num value="3">three</num> farthings, beef was only a half-penny.

    <p>Beyond the Traitor's Gate, guarding the outer ward towards the river, were the <rs type="Subject">Cradle lower</rs>, the <rs type="Subject">Well Tower</rs>, and the <rs type="Subject">Galleyman Tower</rs>. Near the last was the approach called the <rs type="Subject">Iron Gate.</rs>
</p> 
     <p>Returning to the main entrance, we pass into the <rs type="Subject">Outer  Ward</rs> through the <rs type="Subject">Byward Tower</rs> (so called from the password given on entering it), having on the left the Bell  Tower, in which Bishop Fisher and Lady Arabella Stuart were confined.   There is a similar <quote>Bell Tower</quote> at  Windsor, there almost the only remnant of the ancient castle.
</p><p>We should examine the Traitor's Gate as we pass it. The walls, both at the sides and in front towards the river, are perforated with little passages, with loopholes from <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> which the Lieutenant of the Tower could watch, unseen, the arrival of the prisoners.   We may linger a moment at the top of its steps also, to recollect that it was here that as Sir Thomas More was being led back to prison, after his condemnation, with the fatal sign of the reversed axe carried before him, his devoted daughter Margaret, who had been watching unrecognised amid the crowd, burst through the <figure id="Fig.053" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.033.DO01.00053"><head>Traitor's Gate.</head></figure> guards and flinging herself upon his neck, besought his blessing.

      <p>Immediately opposite the Traitor's Gate, another ancient arch with a portcullis admits us to the <rs type="Subject">Inner Ward</rs>. The old ring on the left of the arch is that to which the rope was fastened, stretched across the roadway, from the boat which brought in the prisoners. This is altogether the most picturesque point in the building.   It is called the <rs type="Subject">Bloody Tower</rs>, from the belief that here the sons of Edward <pb id="p.383" n="383"/> IV. were murdered by order of their uncle Richard III. There is not, however, any proof that, if the murder was committed, it occurred here, and the present name has only been given to the place since the reign of Elizabeth: it was previously called <quote>the Garden Tower,</quote> because it joined the constable's garden, which now forms part of the parade.
</p><p>Though there is no proof that the princes were murdered here, a very old tradition points out the angle at the foot of the wall, outside the gate on the right, as the place of their hasty burial by their reputed assassins, Dighton and Forrest, before their removal by Richard III. to the foot of the staircase in the White Tower.
</p><p>The gate looks the same now as it did when Sir Thomas Wyatt passed through it to his prison, when Sir John Bridges seized him and shook him by the collar, calling him names and saying-- <quote>but that the law must pass upon thee, I would stick thee with my dagger</quote> -- <quote>To the which,</quote> says Holinshed, <quote>Wyatt, holding his arms under his side, and looking grievously with a grim look upon the lieutenant, said,  <quote> It is no mastery now,</quote>  and so passed on.</quote>
</p><p>It is from the little portico on the right within the Bloody Gate that nightly, at ii P.M., the sentry of the guard challenges the Chief Warder having the keys of the fortress -- <quote>Who goes there?</quote>  <quote>Keys.</quote>  <quote>Whose keys?</quote>  <quote>Queen Victoria's keys.</quote> Upon which the Warder exclaims, <quote>God bless Queen Victoria.</quote> The soldiers respond, the keys pass on, and the guard disperse.</p> 
     <p>Just within the gate, on the right, some steps lead into the <rs type="Subject">Wakefield Tower</rs>, where the Regalia is now kept. This tower, which is said to derive its name from the prisoners kept here after the Battle of Wakefield, has a beautiful <pb id="p.384" n="384"/> vaulted roof. Opening from the raised recess of the window on   the south   side is the oratory of Henry VI., which tradition points out as the scene of his murder. The centre of the chamber is occupied by a great glass-case containing
<hi rend="italics">the Regalia</hi>, with the magnificent gold plate used at Coronation banquets.   The collection of plate and jewels here <figure id="fig.055" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.033.DO01.00055"><head>The Wakefield Tower.</head></figure> is valued at <num value="3">three</num> millions.

</p><p>The crown jewels have frequently been pledged by the English kings to Flemish and French merchants. A determined attempt to carry them off was made by an Irishman named Thomas Blood in the reign of Charles II. He was a desperate ruffian, who, amongst other wild deeds, had carried off the Duke of Ormond and very nearly succeeded in hanging him at Tyburn to avenge the deaths of some of his associates in a Dublin insurrection, when the Duke was Lord Lieutenant. On the present occasion he came <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> with his supposed wife to see the Regalia, and while there the woman pretended to be taken ill, and her being conveyed into the rooms of Talbot Edwards, the Deputy-keeper, then <num value="80">eighty</num> years old, was made the pretext for an acquaintance, which ended in a proposition on the part of Blood to bring about a marriage between his son and the daughter of Edwards. Some days after he returned with the imaginary bridegroom and <num value="2">two</num> other companions, and, while waiting for the lady, begged to show them the crown jewels. Edwards complied, and, as soon as the door, according to custom, was locked on the inside, they gagged the old man, beat him till he was half senseless, and began to pack up the regalia.   Fortunately young Edwards returned from Flanders at that moment and arrived to see his father. The old keeper, hearing him, contrived to cry out <quote>Murder,</quote> and the conspirators made off, Blood carrying the crown, and <num value="1">one</num> of his companions, Perrot, the orb.   They were pursued and seized.   The most extraordinary part of the story is, that backed by the reminiscence of his attack on the Duke of Ormond, Blood so contrived to terrify the king by his account of the vengeance which his friends would take in case of his execution, that he was not only released, but allowed a pension of <measure key="500l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year! while poor old Edwards, promised a pension which was never paid, was allowed to die almost in destitution.
</p><p>Before the Regalia were removed hither, the Wakefield Tower was used as a Record office. It was here that Selden, with Sir Robert Cotton, searched for the precedents upon which the Petition of Rights was founded. Here also Prynne forgot the loss of his ears in compiling materials for his books, for when some <num value="1">one</num> asked Charles II. at <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> the Restoration what should be done to keep Prynne quiet, he said, <quote>Let him amuse himself with writing against the Catholics and poring over the records in the Tower,</quote> of which he forthwith gave him the custody, with a salary of <measure key="500l." type="currency">&#x00A3; <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year.
</p><p>The centre of the Inner Ward is occupied by the mighty

In the centre are <num value="22">twenty-two</num> equestrian figures in suits of armour, illustrating the different reigns from Edward I. to James II. The suits of armour are all ascribed to different kings or knights, but for the most part without authority.
</p><p>The collection is a fine <num value="1">one</num>, but not to be compared to those of Madrid and Vienna, or even to that of Turin. <pb id="p.388" n="388"/> Suits which really belonged to those to   whom   they are assigned, and   which   therefore especially   require notice, are-
   <quote rend="blockquote"><p><hi rend="italics">Right</hi> (in the recess). The glorious suit (of German manufacture) presented to Henry VIII. on his marriage with Katharine of Arragon. There is a similar suit in the Belvidere at Vienna.
</p><p><cit><quote><p>The badges of this king and queen, the rose and the pomegranate, are engraved on various parts of the armour.   On the fans of the genouilleres is the Sheaf of Arrows, the device adopted by Ferdinand, the father of Katharine, on his conquest of Granada.

The same letters similarly united by a knot, which includes also a curious love-badge, formed of a half rose and half pomegranate, are engraved on the croupiere of the horse.

</p><p>Suit of russet armour, covered with filigree work, of the time of Edward VI. The horse armour is adorned with the badges of Burgundy and Granada.

   </p><p>Armour attributed to James II. The head is interesting as having been carved by Grinling Gibbons as a portrait of Charles II.</p> <pb id="p.389" n="389"/>
<p>The oldest piece of armour here is an Asiatic suit of the time of the Crusades, brought from Tong Castle, in Shropshire.
</p><p>In a cabinet in the recess at the end of the armoury (right) are the awful <quote>Headsman's Mask,</quote> and the Burgonet of Will Somers, jester to Sir Thomas More and afterwards to Henry VIII.: it is a kind of head-piece, with ram's horns.</p></quote>

</p><p>A staircase leads (passing through some imitation pillars and a Norman doorway formed out of a window) to Queen Elizabeth's armoury. Here also the old Norman walls are everywhere spoilt by deal panelling and a ridiculous decoration of pistols, sabres, &amp;c., arranged in the forms of feathers or flowers. At the foot of the stairs is a curious suit of armour sent to Charles II. by the Great Mogul.
</p><p>On the left of <hi rend="italics">Queen Elizabeth's Armoury</hi> is a dark cell falsely called the prison of Sir Walter Raleigh. At the entrance are inscriptions left by prisoners after Sir Thomas Wyatt's rebellion-

</p><p>Here also occurred that stranger scene in <dateStruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></dateStruct>, when the  Protector (afterwards Richard III.), coming in amongst the <pb id="p.394" n="394"/> lords in council, asked the Bishop of Ely to send for some strawberries from his famous garden in <placeName key="bart,Holborn">Holborn</placeName>. It is irresistible to quote Sir Thomas More's graphic account of what followed.
    <quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><p>The protector set the lords fast in communing, and thereupon praying them to spare him for a little while, departed thence. And soon after <num value="1">one</num> hour, between <num value="10">10</num> and <num value="11">11</num> , he returned into the chamber among them, all changed, with a wonderful sour, angry countenance, knitting the brows, frowning and frothing and gnawing on the lips; and so sat him down in his place, all the lords much dismayed and sore marvelling of this manner of sudden change, and what thing should him ail.
</p><p> Then, when he had sitten still a while, thus he began:  <quote> What were they worthy to have, that compass and imagine the destruction of me, being so near of blood unto the king, and protector of his royal person and his realm?</quote>  At this question all the lords sate sore astonished, musing much by whom this question should be meant, of which every man wist himself clear. Then the lord-chamberlain,<note id="n.394.1">Lord Hastings, whose wife, Catherine Neville, was Richard's <num value="1">first</num> cousin.</note> as he who for the love between them thought he might be boldest with him, answered and said that they were worthy to be punished as heinous traitors whoever they were. And all the others affirmed the same.  <quote> That is,</quote>  quoth he,  <quote>yonder sorceress, my brother's wife, and another with her,</quote>  meaning the queen.
<lb/><gap/><lb/>
Then said the protector,  <quote> Ye shall all see in what wise that sorceress, and that other witch, of her counsel, Shore's wife, with their affinity, have by their sorcery and witchcraft wasted my body.</quote>  And therewith he plucked up his doublet-sleeve to his elbow, upon his left arm, when he shewed a werish withered arm and small, as it was never other. And thereupon every man's mind sore misgave him, well perceiving that this matter was but a quarrel. For well they wist that the queen was too wise to go about any such folly. And also, if she would, yet would she, of all folk, least make Shore's wife of counsel, whom of all women she most hated, as that concubine whom the king her husband had most loved. And also no man was there present but well knew that his arm was ever such since his birth.
</p><p>Nevertheless the lord-chamberlain answered and said,  <quote> Certainly, my lord, if they have so heinously done, they be worthy heinous punishment.</quote> </p> <pb id="p.395" n="395"/>
<p> <quote> What,</quote>  quoth the protector,  <quote> thou servest me ill I ween with ifs and with ands; I tell thee they have so done, and that I will make good on thy body, traitor.</quote>  And therewith, as in a great anger, he clapped his fist upon the board a great rap; at which token given, <num value="1">one</num> cried  <quote>treason </quote>  without. the chamber. Therewith a.door clapped, and in came there rushing men in harness as many as the chamber might hold. And anon the protector said to the Lord Hastings,  <quote> I arrest thee, traitor.</quote>     <quote>What me, my lord? </quote>  quoth he.  <quote>Yea thee, traitor,</quote>  quoth the protector. And another let fly at the Lord Stanley, who shrunk at the stroke, and fell under the table, or else his head had been cleft to the teeth; for, as shortly as he shrank, yet the blood ran about his. ears.
</p><p> Then were they all quickly bestowed in divers chambers; except the lord-chamberlain, whom the protector bad speed and shrive him apace,  <quote> for by S. Paul,</quote>  quoth he,  <quote> I will not to dinner till I see thy head off.</quote>  It booted him not to ask  <quote>why</quote> ; but heavily he took a priest at adventure, and made a short shrift; for a longer would not be suffered, the protector made so much haste to dinner, which he might not go to till this were done, for saving of his oath. So was he brought forth into the green, beside the chapel within the Tower, and his head laid down upon a long log of timber, and there stricken off; and afterward his body with the head interred at Windsor, beside the body of King Edward; both whose souls our Lord pardon!</p></quote><bibl>-<title>Life of Richard III.</title></bibl></cit></quote>

</p><p>Having looked out of the window   whence Richard beheld the execution on Tower Green, we may enter the broad triforium of <placeName key="cruch,St. John's church">St. John's</placeName> Chapel, whence there was a communication with the royal apartments.
</p><p>There is a glorious view from the leads on the summit of the White Tower.   Greenwich is visible on a fine day. The turrets are restorations. In that by which we enter (N.E.) King John imprisoned the beautiful Maud, daughter of Robert Fitzwalter of Baynard's Castle.</p> 
      <p>The vaults of the White Tower were used as prisons, though there is, no authority for the statement of the Warders that Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More were imprisoned there. As we descend, we may see the remains <pb id="p.396" n="396"/> of the old staircase on the right: a sword shown as Smith O&#x00AB;Brien's is kept there. The holes in which the rack was fixed upon which Anne Askew was tortured are still to be seen in the floor of the vault. Burnet narrates that the Lord Chancellor Wriothesley, throwing off his coat, himself drew it so severely that he almost tore her body asunder. In the prison called <rs type="Subject">Little Ease</rs> Guy Fawkes was imprisoned, with his companions, and here he was racked, and confessed after <num value="30">thirty</num> minutes of torture. On a wall in <num value="1">one</num> of the vaults is the inscription, <quote lang="LA">Sacris vestris indutus, dum sacra mysteria servans, captus et in hoc angusto carcere inclusus. T. Fisher</quote>--probably by a Jesuit priest involved in the conspiracy.
</p><p>The Armouries and the Regalia are the sights usually shown to strangers. Those really interested in the Tower will obtain leave to make the circuit of the smaller towers, of which there were <num value="12">twelve</num> encircling the Inner Ward. Returning to the Bloody Gate, and ascending the steps on the right they will be shown the rooms over the gateway which are full of curious or great reminiscences.
</p><p>On the wall of a small chamber (left) on the <num value="1">first</num> floor is an inscription by the Bishop of Ross, so long an active partisan of Mary, Queen of Scots, who, while here, confessed the Norfolk and Northumberland plots in her favour, and declared her privy to the death of Darnley: only the name is now legible, the rest of the inscription having been chipped   by axes in the time of the Commonwealth. Another room   on this floor is that whither Felton, the murderer of Buckingham, was brought to prison, blessed by the people on his way. Here also Colonel Hutchinson was imprisoned after the Restoration- <quote>It was a great dark <pb id="p.397" n="397"/> room,</quote> says Mrs. Hutchinson, <quote>with no window in it, and the portcullis of a gate was drawn up within it, and below there sate every night a court of guard.</quote> The same prison was afterwards occupied by a very different character, James II.'s Judge Jeffreys, who was taken at <placeName key="cruch,Wapping">Wapping</placeName> in the dress of a sailor by a man he had injured, and who died here of drinking, having, during his imprisonment, been insulted by receiving a present of a barrel, apparently containing Colchester oysters, but really a halter.</p> 
     <p>On the upper floor is the room where the supposed murder of the Princes took place. Its window opens upon a narrow passage by which the assassins are said to have entered from the outside walk upon the walls. The rooms have been subdivided in late times. In <num value="1">one</num> of them Margaret Cheyne was imprisoned, the wild woman who excited the <num value="2">second</num> pilgrim-invasion of Yorkshire in the reign of Henry VIII., its object being to overthrow the power of Cromwell and restore Catherine of Arragon. Here Dudley, Earl of Northumberland, father-in-law of Lady Jane Grey, was imprisoned, and hence he was led to the scaffold. Here was the <num value="1">first</num> prison of Archbishop Cranmer. Henry, Earl of Northumberland, imprisoned for exciting a Catholic crusade against Elizabeth, shot himself here, <dateStruct value="1585-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="21">21</day>, <year reg="1585">1585</year></dateStruct>, to avoid the confiscation of his estates. In the same room Sir Thomas Overbury, in the reign of James I., underwent slow agonies of poisoning at the hands of the Earl and Countess of Somerset and their minions. Here also Sir Walter Raleigh lived through his <num value="2">second</num> and longest imprisonment of <num value="16">sixteen</num> years, being accused of a plot in favour of Lady Arabella Stuart.   His imprisonment was not rendered unnecessarily severe, and his wife and son <pb id="p.398" n="398"/> were allowed to live near him in the Tower. In the still existing room   he wrote his <title>History of the World,</title> and burnt its <num value="2">second</num> volume as a sacrifice to Truth on being convinced that a murder, which he fancied that he had seen from his prison window, was only an optical delusion.<note id="n.398.1">D&#x00AB;Israeli, <title>Curiosities of Literature.</title></note> Here he received the visits of Ben Jonson and other clever men of the time, and of Prince Henry, who said, <quote>No man but my father would keep such a bird in such a cage.</quote> In the adjoining garden he used to work, to cultivate rare plants, and distil curious essences from   them.   The   narrow walk upon the wall, connected with these apartments, is still called <rs type="Subject">Sir Walter Ralegh's Walk.</rs>
</p> 
     <p>We should next visit the <rs type="Subject">Lieutenants' Lodgings</rs>, where Mrs. Hutchinson was born, being the daughter of Sir Allan Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower. On the ground floor we may see the curious <rs type="Subject">Axe of Office</rs> of the Chief Warder, which was carried before the Lieutenant when he accompanied prisoners to the <placeName key="cruch,House of lords">House of Lords</placeName>. As they returned, the axe was carried before the prisoner. If the trial was not finished the face of the axe was away from him; if he was condemned it was turned towards him: thus those watching through the loopholes of the Traitor's Gate knew his fate at once.
</p><p>To the south room on the upper floor Guy Fawkes and his friends were brought for examination before Cecil, Nottingham, Mountjoy, and Northampton. Cecil wrote of Guy Fawkes, <quote>He is no more dismayed than if he were taken for a poor robbery on the highway.</quote> There is a fine bust in wood of James I. over the chimney-piece, and the names of the conspirators are given on <num value="1">one</num> of a set of <pb id="p.399" n="399"/> tablets on the left, which contain curious Latin inscriptions put up by Sir William   Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, to flatter the vainglorious James I., from some of which the following are translated:--

   <p>We now reach the <rs type="Subject">Bell Tower</rs>, so called from being surmounted by a wooden turret, containing the alarm bell of the garrison. At the entrance of the upper room from the walk upon the wall is the inscription-

</p><p>The curious vaulted chamber of the Bell Tower is that where John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, was imprisoned in his eightieth year. He was condemned for treason because he believed in the prophecies of the Maid of Kent, who said that a judgment would follow Henry VIII.'s divorce of Katherine of Aragon. <quote>You believe the prophecies,</quote> said Cromwell, <quote>because you wish them to be true.</quote> From the Bell Tower he wrote piteously to Cromwell, <quote>I beseech you to be good master in my necessity; for I have neither shirt, nor suit, nor yet other clothes that are necessary for me to wear, but that be ragged and rent too shamefully. Notwithstanding, I might easily suffer that, if I could keep my body warm.   But my diet also, God knoweth how slender it is at many times. And now in mine age, my stomach may not away but with a few kinds of meats, which, if I want, I decay forthwith.</quote> While Fisher was in prison the Pope, to comfort him, sent him a cardinal's hat. <quote>Fore God,</quote> said the king, <quote>if he wear it he shall wear it on his shoulders,</quote> and his death-warrant was signed, so that <quote>his cardinal's hat and his head never met together.</quote> <note id="n.400.1">Fuller.</note> The old man put on his best suit for what he called his marriage day, and went forth gladly to the scaffold, with his New <pb id="p.401" n="401"/> Testament in his hand.   It opened at the passage, <quote>This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</quote>
</p><p>The Bell Tower is said to have been also the prison of the Princess Elizabeth, but it is more probable that she was confined in the royal apartments. It is certain that after a month's strict confinement she was allowed to walk in the Queen's Garden.   Arabella Stuart, however, who had married Sir William   Seymour, <quote>with the love which laughs at privy councils,</quote> <note id="n.401.1">D&#x00AB;Israeli.</note> certainly languished here for <num value="4">four</num> years after her capture in Calais roads while attempting to escape with her husband to France.

<p>Adjoining the Bell Tower is a room with an ancient chimney-piece inscribed- <quote>Upon the <num value="20">twentieth</num> daie of June in yere of our Lord a <num value="1053">thousand five hundred three</num> score and <num value="5">five</num>, was the Right honorable countes of Lennox Grace committede prysoner to thys lodgynge for the marreage of her sonne my Lord Henry Darnle and the Queen of Scotland.

</p><p>The chapel contains several interesting monuments. At the N.E. corner of the north aisle is the noble alabaster tomb (originally in front of the chancel) of Sir Richard Cholmondeley, Lieutenant of the Tower under Henry VII. (<hi rend="italics">ob</hi>. <dateStruct value="1544--"><year reg="1544">1544</year></dateStruct>), and his wife Elizabeth. His effigy is in plate armour with a collar of SS., his head rests on a helmet, his feet on a lion: his wife, who lies on her left side, has a pointed headdress: both the statues were once coloured and gilt. The north wall of the chancel is occupied by the tomb of Sir Richard Blount (<dateStruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></dateStruct>) and Sir Michael Blount, his son (<dateStruct value="1592--"><year reg="1592">1592</year></dateStruct>), both Lieutenants of the Tower. On the south wall of the chancel are some quaint monuments to the Carey family and the black marble tablet to Sir Allan Apsley (father of Mrs. Hutchinson), <dateStruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></dateStruct>. Other monuments commemorate Valentine Pyne (<dateStruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></dateStruct>), Master Gunner <pb id="p.410" n="410"/> of England; Sir Jonas More (<dateStruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></dateStruct>), Surveyor-General of the Ordnance under Charles.

Of the girlish Queen Katharine no bones have been found, but some male bones with a skull have been identified as those of the Duke of Northumberland, whose head was buried with him. The Duke of Monmouth, the unfortunate son of Charles II., was buried beneath the altar, where his bones exist still. On the left of Anne Boleyn (north of chancel) lies her brother, Lord Rochford; to the right of Katherine Howard (south) were her friend Lady Rochford, and the venerable Countess of Salisbury, whose bones have been identified. Behind the Queens lie Lord Guildford Dudley, Lady Jane Grey, the Duke of Suffolk, <pb id="p.411" n="411"/> Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Arundel, Earl of Essex, and Sir Thomas Overbury.

<p>The Fire began early in the morning of Sunday the <dateStruct value="1666-09-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1666">1666</year></dateStruct>, in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Farryner, the King's Baker, in <placeName key="bart,Pudding Lane">Pudding Lane</placeName>.   This man, when cross-examined before the Committee of the <placeName key="cruch,House of commons">House of Commons</placeName>, proved that he had left his house perfectly safe at <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock on Saturday night, and was convinced that it had been purposely fired. The rapidity with which the flames spread, chiefly owing to the number of houses built of timber, defied all measures for arresting them, though on the afternoon of the <num value="1">first</num> day the King sent Pepys from <placeName key="bart,Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName> to the Lord Mayor, commanding him to <quote>spare no houses, but pull down before the fire every way.</quote> By the <num value="1">first</num> night Pepys could <quote>endure no more upon the water, and from <placeName key="bart,Bankside">Bankside</placeName> (<placeName key="cruch,Southwark">Southwark</placeName>) saw the fire grow, and as it grew   darker, appear more and more, and in corners, and upon steeples, and between churches and houses, as far as we could see up the hill of the City, in a most horrid, malicious, bloody flame, not like the flame of an ordinary fire. We staid,</quote> he says, <quote>till, it being darkish, we saw the fire as only <num value="1">one</num> entire arch of fire from this to the other side of the bridge, and in a bow lip the hill for an arch of above a mile long.</quote> Evelyn describes the dreadful scene of the same night-
</p><p> <quote>I saw the whole south part of the City burning, from <placeName key="bart,Cheapside">Cheapside</placeName> to the Thames, and all along <placeName key="bart,Cornhill">Cornhill</placeName> (for it likewise kindled back against the wind as well as forward), <placeName key="bart,Tower Street">Tower Street</placeName>, <placeName key="bart,Fenchurch Street">Fenchurch Street</placeName>, Gracious Street, and so along to Baynard's Castle, and was taking hold of <placeName key="cruch,St. Paul's church">St. Paul's Church</placeName>, to which the scaffolds contributed exceedingly. The conflagration was so universal, and the people so astonished, that, from the beginning, I know not by what despondency or fate, they hardly stirred to quench it; so that there was nothing heard or seen but crying out and lamentation, running about like distracted creatures, without at all attempting to save even their goods; such a strange consternation <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> there was upon them, so as it burned, both in breadth and length, the churches, public halls, Exchange, hospitals, monuments, and ornaments, leaping after a prodigious manner from house to house and street to street, at great distances from <num value="1">one</num> to the other; for the heat, with a long set of fair and warm weather, had even ignited the air and prepared the materials to receive the fire, which devoured after an incredible manner houses, furniture, and everything. Here we saw the Thames covered with goods floating, all the barges and boats laden with what some had time and courage to save; as on the other, the carts, &amp;c., carrying out to the fields; which for many miles were strewn with moveables of all sorts, and tents erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous spectacle! such as haply the world had not seen the like since the foundation of it, nor to be outdone till the universal conflagration of it. All the sky was of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning oven, and the light seen for above <num value="40">forty</num> miles round about for many nights: God grant mine eyes may never see the like! who now saw above <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> houses all in <num value="1">one</num> flame; the noise and cracking and thunder of the impetuous flames, the shrieking of women and children, the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses, and churches, was like a hideous storm, and the air all about so hot and inflamed that at last <num value="1">one</num> was not able to approach it; so that they were forced to stand still and let the flames burn on, which they did for near <num value="2">two</num> miles in length and <num value="1">one</num> in breadth. The clouds also of smoke were dismal, and reached, upon computation, near <num value="50">fifty</num> miles in length.</quote>
</p><p>At noon on Tuesday the <num value="5">5th</num> the Fire <num value="1">first</num> began to be checked, at the Temple Church in <placeName key="bart,Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, and Pie Corner in Smithfield, gunpowder being then used in destroying the houses, and producing gaps too wide to be overleaped by the flames, but by that time the destruction had included <num value="89">eighty-nine</num> churches, the City gates, <placeName key="cruch,Guildhall">Guildhall</placeName>, many public structures, hospitals, schools, libraries, <num value="13200">thirteen thousand two hundred</num> dwelling-houses, <num value="400">four hundred</num> streets; out of <num value="26">twenty-six</num> wards it had utterly destroyed <num value="15">fifteen</num>, and left <num value="8">eight</num> others shattered and half burnt. The ruins of the  City covered <num value="436">four hundred and thirty-six</num> acres, the part left standing occupied <num value="75">seventy-five</num> acres: the loss was <num value="11">eleven</num> <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> millions, but-London has never since suffered from   the Plague.
</p><p>A committee was immediately formed to inquire into the causes of the Fire, before which <num value="1">one</num> Robert Hubeft, a French priest of Rouen, <num value="25">25</num> years of age, declared that he had set fire intentionally to the house of Farryner, the baker in <placeName key="bart,Pudding Lane">Pudding Lane</placeName>, by putting a lighted fire-ball in at a window at the end of a long pole. He pointed out the exact spot where this occurred, and stated that he had been suborned at Paris for this deed, and that he had <num value="3">three</num> accomplices. No <num value="1">one</num> believed his story, yet the jury who tried him found him guilty, and he was hung. <hi rend="italics">Afterwards</hi>
it was shown that he was insane, and the master of the ship which brought him over from France proved that he did not land till <num value="2">two</num> days after the Fire. Still the confession of Hubert, in those times of bitter religious animosity, when Titus Oates and his plot had excited additional horror of Papists, was considered sufficient to authorise the inscription on the pedestal of the Monument.
     <quote rend="blockquote"><p>This pillar was set up in perpetual remembrance of that most dreadful burning of this Protestant city, begun and carried on by ye treachery and malice of ye popish faction, in ye beginning of Septem, in ye year of our Lord <dateStruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></dateStruct>, in order to ye carrying on of their horrid plott for extirpating the Protestant religion and old English liberty, and the introducing popery and slavery.

In <dateStruct value="1276--"><year reg="1276">1276</year></dateStruct> they moved to the banks of the Thames, where their monastery and church rose to great splendour through the constant favour of Edward I., who deposited the heart of his beloved Eleanor at Blackfriars, when her body was taken to <placeName key="cruch,Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. The belief that <quote>to be buried in the habit of the Order was a sure preservative against the attacks of the devil</quote> afterwards led to the interment of many great and wealthy personages in the monastic church, <pb id="p.439" n="439"/> including Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, and his wife Margaret of Scotland; Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, beheaded in the Wars of the Roses; and Sir Thomas and Dame Maude Parr, father and mother of Queen Katherine Parr. Several Parliaments met in the monastery. The <quote>Black Parliament,</quote> which took its name from hence, with Sir Thomas More as its Speaker, here received the exorbitant demands of Henry VIII. for a subsidy for his French wars, insolently conveyed through Wolsey, Charles V. insisted upon lodging at the Prior's house when he came to London in <dateStruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></dateStruct>, though <placeName key="cruch,Bridewell">Bridewell</placeName> Palace was proposed for him.

On the same spot, only a few months later, Parliament pronounced its sentence of <foreign lang="LA">praemunire</foreign> against Wolsey himself.
</p><p>Blackfriars was granted by Edward VI. to Sir Thomas Cawarden, <quote>Master of the King's Revels,</quote> who pulled down its church of many associations and that of St. Anne, which adjoined it.

Except the Stationers' it is the only Company whose members are strictly what its name implies, and it has <num value="500">five hundred</num>   members. The laboratories connected with this Hall result from the association of the Apothecaries and Druggists. For till <dateStruct value="1687"><year reg="1687">1687</year></dateStruct> apothecaries were only what druggists are now, and it was their presuming to prescribe which gave such offence to the <placeName key="cruch,College of Physicians">College of Physicians</placeName> in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century and led to the verses of Garth-

Pennant describes the street on <placeName key="bart,London Bridge">London Bridge</placeName> shortly before its fall- <quote>narrow, darksome, and   dangerous to passengers from the multitude of carriages: frequent arches of strong timbers crossing the street from the tops of the houses, to keep them together and from falling into the river.   Nothing but use could preserve the repose of the inmates, who soon grew deaf to the noise of falling waters, the clamours of watermen, or the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches.</quote> The narrowness of the arches beneath the bridge, and the consequent compression of the river, made <quote>shooting the bridge</quote> very dangerous.   Ray's proverb, <quote><placeName key="bart,London Bridge">London Bridge</placeName> was made for wise men to go over, and fools to go under,</quote> shows the popular feeling about its rapids.
