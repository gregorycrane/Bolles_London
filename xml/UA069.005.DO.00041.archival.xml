<p>The "Cries"<note n="1" place="foot"> See page 138</note> have been sufficiently
well received in bolder form at a
guinea to induce the publication of this
additionally illustrated extension at the more
popular price of a shilling.</p>

<p>DATES, unless in the form of the luscious fruit of Smyrna, are generally dry. It is enough therefore to state that the earliest mention of London Cries is found in a quaint old ballad entitled <quote>London Lyckpenny,</quote> or Lack penny, by that prolific writer, John Lydgate, a Benedictine monk of Bury St. Edmunds, who flourished about the middle of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>These cries are particularly quaint, and especially valuable as a record of the daily life of the time.
<lb/>Then unto London I dyd me hye,
<lb/>Of all the land it beareth the pryse:
<lb/>Hot pescodes, one began to crye,
<lb/>Stabery rype, and cherryes in the ryse;<note n="1" place="foot">On the bough</note></p>

<lb/>One bad me come nere and by some spyce,
<lb/>Peper and safforne they gan me bede,
<lb/>But for lack of money I myght not spede.
<lb/>Then to the Chepe I began me drawne,
<lb/>Where mutch people I saw for to stande;
<lb/>One spred me velvet, sylke, and lawne,
<lb/>Another he taketh me by the hande,
<lb/>" Here is Parys thred, the fynest in the land;"
<lb/>I never was used to such thyngs indede,
<lb/>And wantyng money I myght not spede.
<lb/>Then went I forth by London stone,

<lb/>But, for want of mony I myght not be sped.
<lb/>Then I hyed me into Est-Chepe;
<lb/>One cryes rybbs of befe, and many a pye;</p>
<p>Since Lydgate's time the cries of London have been
a stock subject for ballads and children's books, of


<pb n="6" id="p.6"/>

which, in various forms, some hundreds must have
appeared within the last two centuries. The cuts, unless from the hand of a Rowlandson or a Cruikshank,
are usually of the mechanical order; and one finds
copies of the same illustrations, though differently
treated, constantly reappearing.</p>
<p>In the books there is usually a cut on each page,
with a cry printed above or underneath, and in addition a verse of descriptive poetry, which, if not of the
highest order, serves its purpose.
With his machine and ass to help
<lb/>To draw the frame along,
<lb/>Pray mark the razor-grinder's yelp
<lb/>The burden of his song.
<lb/>His patched umbrella quick aloft
<lb/>He mounts if skies should lower,
<lb/>Then laughing whirls his wheel full oft,
<lb/>Nor heeds the falling shower.</p>
<p>A well-known collection is that entitled " Habits &#x0026; 
Cryes of the City of London, drawne after the Life;
P. [Pearce] Tempest, excudit," containing seventy-four
plates, drawn by Marcellus Laroon [Lauron], and republished in <date value="1711">1711</date>. The first edition, with only fifty
illustrations, had appeared some three-and-twenty
years earlier; and many of the copper-plates in the


<pb n="7" id="p.7"/>

later issue were so altered as to bring the costume
into the fashion of the time of republication. The
hats had their high crowns cut down into low; and
shoe-buckles were substituted for laces. Otherwise
the plates,-with the exception of some of the faces,
which were entirely re-engraved,-were left in their
original condition.<note n="4" place="foot">Mr. J. E. Gardner's collection of prints and drawings illustrating London, and numbering considerably over 20,0000, contains many fine prints illustrating Old London Cries, including
numerous examples of the alterations here indicated.</note>  The letter-press descriptions are
in English, French, and Italian. The engraver, Marcellus Lauron, or Captain.Laroon, who was born in
London, has left on record that his family name was
Lauron, but being always called Laroon, he adopted
that spelling in early life. Of the seventy-four plates,
those representing eccentric characters, etc., are omitted from the list that follows :

<lb/>The man blowing a trumpet-troope every one !-was a
street seller of toy hobby-horses. He carried his wares in a
sort of cage; and to each rudely represented horse's head was
attached a small flag. The toy hobby-horse has long since
disappeared, and nowadays we give a little boy a stick to thrust
between his legs as a Bucephalus. Hone opines that our forefathers were better natured, for they presented him with something of the semblance of the genuine animal.</item>

<lb/>In a series of early prints in the Bridgewater library, from
copper plates, by an unknown artist, probably engraved between <date value="1650">1650</date> and 1680<date value="1680"></date>, there is one thus titled: " Some broken
Breade and meate for ye poore prisoners: for the Lorde's sake
pittey the poore." Within the memory of our fathers a tin box
was put out from a grated window in the Fleet prison, a prisoner
meanwhile imploring the public to remember the poor debtors.
In the "Cries of York, for the amusement of young children,"
undated, but published probably towards the end of the last
century, are the following lines:-
<lb/>Of prisoners in the Castle drear

<p>The cry of <quote>Marking Stones,</quote> which marked
black or red, and preceded the daintier cedar-encased
lead pencil of our own time, is not mentioned by
Laroon. J. T. Smith,<note n="5" place="foot"><quote>The Cries of London:</quote> Copied from rare engravings
or drawn from the life by John Thomas Smith, late Keeper of
the Prints in the British Museum, 1839. On inquiring at the Print
Department of the British Museum for a copy of this work, the
attendant knew nothing of it, and was quite sure the department
had no such book. It turned up on a little pressure, however,
but the leaves were uncut.-<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="FR">Les morts vont vite</foreign> !</hi></note> says that the colour of the red
marking-stone was due to <soCalled>Ruddle,</soCalled> a colour not to
be washed out, and that fifty years ago (he wrote in
1839) it was the custom at cheap lodging-houses to
mark with it on linen the words, <hi rend="italics"><quote>Stop thief!</quote></hi></p>
<p>The following lines are from a sheet of London
Cries, twelve in number, undated, but probably of
James the Second's time;-
<lb/>Buy marking-stones, marking-stones buy,
<lb/>Much profit in their use doth lie;
<lb/>I've marking-stones of colour red,

rat-catcher with a banner emblazoned with rats; he is

<p>From all this it will be seen that merchandise of
almost every description was formerly " carried and
cried" in the streets. When shops were little more
than open shanties, the apprentice's cry of " What d'ye
lack, what d'ye lack my masters ?" was often accompanied by a running description of the goods on sale,
together with personal remarks, complimentary or
otherwise, to likely and unlikely buyers.</p>
<p>A very puzzling London Cry, yet at one time a very
common one, was <quote>A tormentor for your fleas!</quote><note n="6" place="foot">See Appendix.</note> What the instrument so heralded could have been,
one can but dimly guess. A contributor to <hi rend="italics">Fraser's

(<date value="1608">1608</date>), he gives us this one: <quote>Buy a very fine mousetrap, or a tormentor for your fleaes ;</quote> and the cry of

Fair (<date value="1614">1614</date>), is, <quote>Buy a mouse-trap, a mouse-trap, or a
tormentor for a flea.</quote> The flea-trap is also alluded to
in <hi rend="italics">The Bonduca</hi> of Beaumont and Fletcher, and in
<hi rend="italics">Travels of Twelve-Pence</hi>, by Taylor, the Water Poet;
and it reappears in a broadside in the Roxburgh Collection of ballads, <quote>The Common Cries of London</quote>
[dated <date value="1662">1662</date> but probably written a hundred years
earlier] : <quote>Buy a trap, a mouse-trap, a torment for the
fleas !</quote> When the great Bard of the Lake School was
on a tour, he made a call at an inn where Shelley happened to be; but the conversation, which the young
man would fain have turned to philosophy and poetry
and art, was almost confined to the elder poet's prosaic
description of his dog as <quote>an excellent flea-trap.</quote> It
may be assumed that fleas were plentiful when this
cry was in vogue; and it may have been that the trap
was part of the (undressed ?) skin of an animal with
the hair left on, in which fleas would naturally take
refuge, drowning, perhaps, being their ultimate fate.
But all this is mere conjecture.
It was unlikely that so close an observer of London
life as Addison should leave unnoticed the Cries of
London; and the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> is interspersed with occasional


<pb n="26" id="p.26"/>

allusions to them. In No. ccli. we read: "There is
nothing which more astonishes a Foreigner, and frights
a Country Squire, than the Cries of London. My good
Friend Sir ROGER often declares that he cannot get
them out of His Head, or go to sleep for them, the
first Week that he is in Town. On the contrary, WILL
HONEYCOMB calls them the <hi rend="italics">Ramage de la Ville</hi>, and
prefers them to the Sounds of Larks and Nightingales,
with all the Musick of the Fields and Woods."</p>
<p>In Steele's comedy of <hi rend="italics">The Funeral</hi>, Trim tells some
ragged soldiers, <quote>There's a thousand things you might
do to help out about this town, as to cry Puff-Puff
Pyes; have you any Knives or Scissors to grind ? or
late in an evening, whip from <hi rend="italics">Grub Street</hi> strange and
bloody News from <hi rend="italics">Flanders</hi>; Votes from the House
of Commons ; Buns, rare Buns; Old Silver Lace,
Cloaks, Sutes or Coats; Old Shoes, Boots or Hats.</quote>
Gay, too, who, in his microscopic lyric of the streets,
<hi rend="italics">Trivia</hi>, omitted little, thus sings of various street
cries :--
<lb/>Now Industry awakes her busy sons;
<lb/>Full charged with News the breathless hawker runs;
<lb/>Shops open, coaches roll, carts slake the ground,
<lb/>And all the streets with passing cries resound.

<p>Addison accuses the London street criers of cultivating the accomplishment of crying their wares so as
not to be understood; and in that curious medley of
<hi rend="italics">bons-mots</hi> and biographical sketches, <quote>The Olio,</quote> by
Francis Grose,-dated <date value="1796">1796</date>, but written probably
some twenty years earlier,-the author says, <quote>The
variety of cries uttered by the retailers of different
articles in the streets of London make no inconsiderable part in its novelty to strangers and foreigners.
An endeavour to guess at the goods they deal in
through the medium of language would be a vain attempt, as few of them convey any articulate sound. It
is by their tune and the time of day that the modern
cries of London are to be discriminated.</quote></p>
<p>J. T. Smith says that the no longer heard cry of
<quote>Holloway Cheese Cakes</quote>  was pronounced <quote>All my
Teeth Ache;</quote> and an old woman who sold mutton
dumplings in the neighbourhood of Gravel Lane called,
<quote>Hot Mutton Trumpery;</quote> while a third crier, an old
man who dealt in brick-dust, used to shout something
that sounded exactly like <quote>Do you want a lick on the
head?</quote> Another man-a vendor of chickweed-brayed
like an ass; while a stentorian bawler, who was described as a great nuisance, shouted <quote>Cat's Meat,</quote>
though he sold cabbages.</p>
<p>Indeed, some of the cries in our own day would



<pb n="31" id="p.31"/>

appear to be just as difficult to distinguish. A lady
tells me that in a poor district she regularly visits, the
coal-cart man cries: <quote>I'm on the woolsack !</quote> but
what he means is, <quote>Fine Wallsend Coal!</quote> The
philologist will find the pronunciation of the peripatetic
Cockney vendor of useful and amusing trifles-almost
invariably penn'orths, by the way-worthy of careful
study. Here are a couple of phonetically rendered
examples: <quote>Bettnooks, a penny fer two, two frer
penny.</quote> [Button hooks, a penny for two, two for a
penny.]  <quote>En endy shoo-awn frer penny.</quote> [A handy
shoe-horn for a penny.]</p>
<p>Amongst the twelve etched London Cries <quote>done

Garden Market">Covent
Garden</placeName>
, <placeName key="Fleet Market">Fleet</placeName>
, and <placeName key="NEwgate Market">Newgate Markets</placeName>
. They culled
from the hedges and brooks not only watercresses, of
which London now annually consumes about &#x00A3;5,000
worth, but dandelions, scurvy grass, nettles, bittersweet, red valerian, cough-grass, feverfew, hedge mustard, and a variety of other simples. Notwithstanding
the greater pungency of the wild variety, preferred on
that account, of late years watercress-growing has
been profitably followed as a branch of market gardening.  In third-rate <soCalled>genteel</soCalled> neighbourhoods,
where the family purse is seldom too well filled,
<quote>Creeses, young watercreeses,</quote> varied by shrimps
or an occasional bloater, would appear to form the
chief afternoon solace. Towards the end of the last
century scurvy-grass was highly esteemed; and the
best scurvy-grass ale is said to have been sold in

<p>The modern dealer in simples, who for a few pence
supplies pills and potions of a more or less harmless
character, calculated for the cure of every bodily ailment that afflicts humanity, flourishes in the poorer
districts of London, and calls himself a herbalist.
During the progress of an all too short acquaintanceship


<pb n="33" id="p.33"/>

struck up with a simpler in an Essex country lane
through the medium of a particularly fragrant and
soothing herb, the conversation happened on depression of spirits, and dandelion tea was declared to
be an unfailing specific. <quote>You know, sir, bad spirits
means that the liver is out of order. The doctors gives
you a deadly mineral pizen, which they calls blue pill,
and it certainly do pizen 'em, but then you run the
chance of being pizened yerself.</quote> A look of astonishment caused him to continue. <quote>You've noticed the
'oles in a sheep's liver after it's cut up, 'aven't you ?
Well, them 'oles is caused by slugs, and 'uman bein's
is infested just the same. So is awsiz (horses), but they
don't never take no blue pill. Catch 'em ! The doctors
knows all about it, bless yer, but they don't talk so plain
as me. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> calls out-of-sort-ishness <soCalled>slugs in the liver,</soCalled>

penn'rth of blue pill, for which they charges a guinea,
and as often as not they pizens the patient too.</quote> What
a mine of <soCalled>copy</soCalled> that simple simpler would have
proved to a James Payn or a Walter Besant !</p>
<p>The following at one time popular and often reprinted lines, to the tune of  <quote>The Merry Christ Church
Bells,</quote> are from the Roxburgh Collection of Ballads:



<pb n="34" id="p.34"/>

<lb/>Here's fine rosemary, sage and thyme.
<lb/>Come buy my ground ivy.
<lb/>Here's fetherfew, gilliflowers, and rue.

<lb/>Here's balm and hissop and cinquefoil,

<lb/>Let none despise the merry, merry wives
<lb/>Of famous London town.

<lb/>Dandelion and horseleek.
<lb/>Here's dragon's tongue and horehound.
<lb/>Let none despise the merry, merry wives
<lb/>Of famous London town.</p>
<p>Less characteristic is an old undated penny ballad
fom which we cull the following lines:-


<pb n="35" id="p.35"/>

<lb/>Wood, three bundles a penny, all dried deal;
<lb/>Now, who'll buy a good flint or steel?
<lb/>Buy a walking stick, a good ash stump;
<lb/>Hearthstone, pretty maids, a penny a lump.
<lb/>Fine mackrel; penny a plateful sprats;
<lb/>Dog's meat, marm, to feed your cats.</p>
<p>The cry of Saloop, a favourite drink of the young
bloods of a hundred and fifty years back, conveys no
meaning to the present generation. Considered as a
sovereign cure for drunkenness, and pleasant withal,
saloop, first sold at street corners, where it was consumed principally about the hour of midnight, eventually found its way into the coffee houses. The
ingredients used in the preparation of this beverage
were of several kinds-sassafras, and plants of the
genus known by the simplers as cuckoo-flowers, being
the principal among them. Saloop finally disappeared
some five and twenty years ago.</p>
<p>The watchman cried the time every half hour.
In addition to a lantern and rattle, he was armed with
a stout stick. T. L. Busby, who in <date value="1819">1819</date> illustrated
<quote>The Costumes of the Lower Orders of London,</quote> tells
us that in March the watchman began his rounds at
eight in the evening, and finished them at six in the
morning. From April to September his hours were


<pb n="36" id="p.36"/>

from ten till five; and from November to the end
of February, twelve till seven. During the darkest
months there was an extra watch from six to twelve,
and extra patrols or sergeants walked over the beats
at intervals.</p>
<p>One of London's best known characters, the Waterman, does not appear to have adopted a cry; or,
if he did, no mention of it can be found.  But a
correspondent of <hi rend="italics">Notes and Queries</hi> (5th S. I. May 2,
<date value="1874">1874</date>) says:  <quote>I heard this verse of a very old (waterman's) song from a very old gentleman on the occasion
of the last overflow of the Thames :-
<lb/><quote>Twopence to London Bridge, threepence to the
Strand,
<lb/>Fourpence, Sir, to Whitehall Stairs,or else you'll go
by land.</quote></quote></p>
<p>The point of departure, however, is not given.</p>

one every year; each apprentice's indenture stipulating, in the language of the officials who are still wig-wearers, that his master should find him in <quote>one good
and sufficient wig, yearly, and every year, for, and
during, and unto, the expiration of the full end and
term of his apprenticeship.</quote> A verse of the time tells
us :-
<lb/>Full many a year in Middle Row has this old barber
been,
<lb/>Which those who often that way go have full as often
seen;
<lb/>Bucks, jemmies, coxcombs, bloods and beaux, the
lawyer, the divine,
<lb/>Each to this reverend tonsor goes to purchase wigs so
fine.</p>
<p><quote>Buy my rumps and burrs !</quote> is a cry requiring a
word of explanation. Before the skins of the newly
flayed oxen were consigned to the tanner, the inside of
the ear, called the burr, and the fleshy part of the tail
were removed, and when seasoned and baked are said
to have formed a cheap and appetising dish.</p>
<p>Ned Ward, the author of that curious work, <quote>The
London Spy</quote> (<date value="1703">1703</date>), alludes to the melancholy ditty
of <quote>Hot baked Wardens [pears], and Pippins;</quote> and,
in describing the amusements of Bartholomew Fair,



<pb n="39" id="p.39"/>

states that in leaving a booth he was assailed with
<quote>Will you buy a Mouse Trap or a Rat Trap ? Will
you buy a Cloath Brush, or Hat Brush, or a Comb
Brush?</quote>  The writer possesses a very curious old
scenic aquatint print in the form of a fan mount,
representing Bartholomew Fair in <date value="1721">1721</date>. The following descriptive matter is printed in the semicircular
space under the fan:-</p>
<p>
<quote>BARTHOLOMEW FAIR, <date value="1721">1721</date>.
This fair was granted by Henry the Ist, to one
Rahere, a witty and pleasant gentleman of his Court,
in aid and for the support of an Hospital, Priory, and
Church, dedicated to St. Bartholomew, which he built
in repentance of his former profligacy and folly. The
succeeding Priors claimed, by certain Charters, to have
a Fair every year, during three days, viz.: on the Eve,
the Day, and on the Morrow of St. Bartholomew. At
this period the Clothiers of England, and drapers of
London, kept their Booths and Standings there, and a
Court of Piepouder was held daily for the settlement
of all Debts and Contracts. About the year <date value="1721">1721</date>,
when the present interesting View of this popular Fair
was taken, the Drama was considered of some importance, and a series of minor although regular Pieces
were acted in its various Booths. At Lee and Harper's



<pb n="40" id="p.40"/>

the Siege of Berthulia is performing, in which is introduced the Tragedy of Holifernis. Persons of Rank
were also its occasional visitors, and the figure on the
right is supposed to be that of Sir Robert Walpole,
then Prime Minister. Fawkes, the famous conjuror,
forms a conspicuous feature, and is the only portrait
of him known to exist. The remaining amusements
are not unlike those of our day, except in the articles
of Hollands and Gin, with which the lower orders
were then accustomed to indulge, unfettered by licence
or excise.</quote></p>
<p>Amongst the numerous figures represented on the
fan mount, but not mentioned by its publisher, Mr.
Setchel, is that of the crier of apples, whose basket is
piled high with tempting fruit. Another woman has
charge of a barrow laden with pears as big as pumpkins; and a couple of oyster-women, whose wares are
on the same gigantic scale, are evidently engaged in a
hot wrangle. Although foreign to our subject, it may
be mentioned that the statement as to the portrait of
Fawkes the conjuror being the only one known, is
incorrect.

<p>The old cry of" Marking Irons " has died out. The

old-fashioned furniture. If in good condition, the set

<p>The modern bootblack with his <quote>Clean yer boots,
shine 'em, sir ?</quote> is the successor of the obsolete shoeblack, whose stock-in-trade consisted of liquid blacking, an old wig for removing dust or wet, a knife for
use on very muddy days, and brushes. Towards the
end of the last century, Finsbury Square-then an
open field-was a favourite place for shoeblacks, who
intercepted the city merchants and their clerks in their
daily walks to and from their residences in the villages
of Islington and Hoxton. At that time tight breeches
and shoes were worn; and the shoeblack was careful
not to smear the buckles or soil the fine white stockings of his patrons. In a print of this period the cry
is <quote>Japan your shoes, your honour ?</quote> Cake blacking,
introduced by that famous, but, as regards the last
mentioned, somewhat antagonistic trio, Day, Martin,
and Warren, <quote>the most poetical of blacking makers
and most transparent of poets,</quote> which was quickly
taken into general use, snuffed out the shoeblack; and

his trade of selling

a benefactor to the
poorer portion of humanity. He changes his cry with
the stock on his barrow. He will invest one day in
pine-apples, when there is a glut of them-perhaps a
little over-ripe-in Pudding Lane; and in stentorian
voice will then make known his willingness to exchange



<pb n="47" id="p.47"/>

slices for a halfpenny each, or a whole one for
sixpence. On other days it may be apples, or oranges,
fish, vegetables, photographs, or even tortoises; the
latter being popularly supposed to earn a free, if un-
comfortable, passage to this country in homeward-
bound ships as wedges to keep the cargo from shifting
in the hold. It is not often that goods intended for
the thriving shopkeeper find their way to the barrow
of the costermonger. Some time ago amber-tipped
cherry or briar-wood pipes were freely offered and as
freely bought in the streets at a penny each. Suddenly
the supply stopped; for the unfortunate wholesale
dealer in Houndsditch, who might have known better,
had mistaken <quote>dozen</quote> for <quote>gross</quote> in his advice; and
at 6s. 6d. per gross the pipes could readily be retailed
for a penny each; whereas at the cost price of 6s. 6d.
a dozen, one shilling ought to have been asked. It
seems that not only did the importer imagine that the
amber mouthpieces were imitation, but Bill Sykes also
thought he was <soCalled>doing</soCalled> the public when he announced
them as real.</p>
<p>In the present race of street criers there are trick-
sters in a small way; as, for instance, the well known
character who picks up a living by selling a bulky-
looking volume of songs. His long-drawn and never
varied cry of <quote>Three un-derd an' fif-ty songs for a



<pb n="p.48" id="p.48"/>

penny!</quote> is really <quote>Three under fifty songs for a
penny.</quote> The book is purposely folded very loosely so
as to bulk well; but a little squeezing reduces it to the
thickness of an ordinary tract. Street criers are honest
enough, however, in the main.  If vegetables are
sometimes a little stale, or fruit is suspiciously overripe, they do not perhaps feel absolutely called upon
to mention these facts; but they give bouncing penn'orths, and their clients are generally shrewd enough to
take good care of themselves. Petty thieves of the
area-sneak type use well-known cries as a blind while
pursuing their real calling,-match-selling often serving as an opportunity for pilfering. Blacker sheep
than these there are; but fortunately one does not
often come across them. Walking one foggy afternoon towards dusk along the Bayswater Road, I was
accosted by a shivering and coatless vagabond who
offered a tract. Wishing to shake off so unsavoury a
companion, I attempted to cross the road, but a few
yards from the kerb he barred further progress.</p>
<p><quote>Sixpence, Sir, only sixpence, I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have sixpence!</quote>
and as he spoke he bared a huge arm knotted like a
blacksmith's. Raising a fist to match, he more than
once shot it out unpleasantly near, exhibiting every
time he did so an eruption of biceps perfectly appalling in its magnitude. That tract is at home somewhere.

<p>There are persons in London who get their living
by manufacturing amusing or useful penny articles,
with which they supply the wholesale houses in
Houndsditch, who in turn find their customers in the
hawkers and street criers. The principal supply, however, is imported from the Continent at prices against
which English labour cannot compete.  Soon forgotten, each novelty has its day, and is cried in a
different manner. Until the law stepped in and put
a stop to the sale, the greatest favourite on public
holidays was the flexible metal tube containing scented
water, which was squirted into the faces of passers-by
with strict impartiality and sometimes with blinding
effect.</p>
<p><quote>All the fun of the fair,</quote>-a wooden toy which,
when drawn smartly down the back or across the
shoulders, emits a sound as if the garment were being
rent-ranks, perhaps, second in the estimation of
'Arry and Emma Ann-she generally gets called
Emma Ran-when out for a holiday. <quote>The Fun of
the Fair</quote> is always about on public holidays, illuminations, Lord Mayor's day, and in fact whenever
people are drawn out of doors in such multitudes that
the pathways are insufficient to hold the slowly moving
and densely packed human stream which perforce
slops over and amicably disputes possession of the



<pb n="51" id="p.51"/>

road with the confused and struggling mass of vehicles
composed of everything that goes on wheels. A real
Malacca cane, the smallest Bible in the world, a
Punch and Judy squeaker, a bird warbler, a gold watch
and chain, and Scotch bagpipes, are, with numerous
others, at present popular and tempting penn'orths;
while the cry of <quote>A penny for a shillin' 'lusterated
magazine </quote>-the epitaph on countless unsuccessful
literary ventures-seems to many an irresistible attraction.</p>
<p>In connection with 'Arry, the chief producer of
street noises, it may be questioned whether London is
now much better off than it was before the passing
of the Elizabethan Statutes of the Streets, by which
citizens were forbidden, under pain of imprisonment,
to blow a horn in the night, or to whistle after the
hour of nine o'clock p.m. Sudden outcries in the still
of the night, and the making of any affray, or the
beating of one's wife-the noise rather than the
brutality appears to have been objected to-were also
specially forbidden. If this old Act is still on the
Statute-book, it is none the less a dead letter. Our
streets are now paraded by companies of boys or
half-grown men who delight in punishing us by means
of that blatant and horribly noisy instrument of dissonant, unchangeable chords, the German concertina.</p>


<pb n="52" id="p.52"/>

<p>In many neighbourhoods sleep is rendered, until the
early hours, impossible by men and women who find
their principal and unmolested amusement in the
shouting of music-hall songs, with an intermittent
accompaniment of shriekings.  Professional street
music of all kinds requires more stringent regulation;
and that produced by perambulating amateurs might
with advantage be well-nigh prohibited altogether.
The ringing of Church bells in the grey of the morning, and the early habits of the chanticleer, are often
among the disadvantages of a closely populated
neighbourhood. Nor are these street noises the only
nuisances of the kind. London walls and partitions
are nearly all thin, and a person whose neighbour's
child is in the habit of practising scale exercises or
<soCalled>pieces,</soCalled> should clearly have the right to require the
removal of the piano a foot or so from the wall, which
would make all the difference between dull annoyance
and distracting torment.</p>
<p>But we are wandering, and wandering into a dismal
bye-way. Returning to our subject, it is impossible
to be melancholy in the presence of the facetious
salesman of the streets, with his unfailing native wit.
Hone tells us of a mildly humorous character, one
<soCalled>Doctor Randal,</soCalled> an orange-seller, who varied the
description of his fruit as circumstances and occasions


<pb n="53" id="p.53"/>
 demanded; as <soCalled>Oratorio oranges,</soCalled> and so on.
A jovial rogue whose beat extends to numerous courts
and alleys on either side
of Fleet Street,regularly
and unblushingly cries,

and by way of addenda,
<quote>Lor, 'ow they do stink
to-day, to be sure!</quote>
His little joke is almost
as much relished as his
shrimps and bloaters,
and they appear to be
always of the freshest.
Were it not that insufficient clothing and an
empty  stomach   are
hardly conducive thereto, the winter cry so
generally heard after a    <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.016.DO01.00021"><head><quote>Stinking Fish!</quote></head></figure>
fall of snow, <quote>Sweep
yer door away, mum ?</quote> might fairly be credited to
an attempt at facetiousness under difficulties, while
the grave earnestness of the mirth-provoking cry of
the Cockney boot-lace man, <quote>Lice, lice, penny a
pair boot-lice!</quote> is strong evidence that he has no



<pb n="54" id="p.54"/>

thought beyond turning the largest possible number
of honest pennies in the shortest possible space of
time.</p>
<p>A search in our collection of books and ballads for
London Cries, humorous in themselves, discovers but
two,-
<lb/><quote>Jaw-work, up and under jaw-work, a whole pot for
a halfpenny, hazel-nuts !</quote>
and-
<lb/><quote>New laid eggs, eight a groat-crack 'em and try
'em  </quote></p>
<p>A somewhat ghastly form of facetiousness was a
favourite one with a curious City character, now
defunct. He was a Jew who sold a nameless toy-a
dried pea loose in a pill box, which was fastened to a
horse-hair, and on being violently twirled, emitted a
vibratory hum that could be heard for some distance. Unless his unvarying cry, <quote>On'y a 'a'penny,</quote>
brought buyers to the fore, he gave vent to frequent
explosions of strange and impious language, which
never failed to provoke the merriment of the
passer-by.</p>
<p>Among the many living City characters is the man
--from his burr evidently a Northumbrian-who sells
boot laces. His cry is, <quote>Boot laces-AND the boot
laces.</quote> This man also has a temper. If sales are

<pb n="56" id="p.56"/>

slow, as they not uncommonly are, his cry culminates
in a storm of muttered abuse; after which mental
refreshment he calmly proceeds as before, <quote>The boot
laces-AND the boot laces.</quote>  Most of us know by
sight the penny Jack-in-the-box seller, whose cry, as
Jack pops up, on the spring of the lid being released,
is a peculiar double squeak, emitted without movement of the lips. The cry is supposed to belong to
the internal economy of the toy, and to be a part of
the penn'orth; but, alas ! Jack, once out of the hands
of his music-master, is voiceless.. The numerous
street sellers of pipe and cigar lights must have a
hard time of it. Following the lucifer match, with its
attendant choking sulphurous fumes, came the evil-smelling, thick, red-tipped, brown paper slip charged
with saltpetre, so that it should smoulder without
flaming. These slips, in shape something like a row
of papered pins, were divided half through and torn
off as required.  Like the brimstone match which
preceded, and the Vesuvian which followed, these
lights (which were sold in the shops at a penny a box,
but in the streets at two and sometimes three boxes
for the same sum) utterly spoilt the-flavour of a cigar;
hence the superiority of the now dominant wax vestas,
The matches of a still earlier period were long slips
of dry wood smeared at either end with brimstone.

They would neither <quote>light only on the box,</quote> nor off
it, unless aided by the uncertain and always trouble-
some flint, steel, and tinder, or the direct application
of flame. <quote>Clean yer pipe; pipe-cleaner, a penny for
two !</quote> is a cry seldom absent from the streets. The
pipe-cleaner is a thin flexible, double-twisted wire
about a foot long, with short bristles interwoven at
one end, and now, <quote>when everybody smokes who
doesn't,</quote> the seller is sure of a more or less constant
trade.</p>
<p>The buyers of the so-called penny ices sold in the
London streets during the summer months are charged
only a halfpenny; and the numerous vendors, usually
Italians, need no cry; for the street gamins and
errand boys buzz around their barrows like flies about
a sugar barrel. For obvious reasons, spoons are not
lent. The soft and half-frozen delicacy is consumed
by the combined aid of tongue and fingers. Parti-coloured Neapolitan ices, vended by unmistakable
natives of Whitechapel or the New Cut, whose curious
cry of <quote>'Okey Pokey</quote> originated no one knows how,
have lately appeared in the streets. Hokey Pokey is
of a firmer make and probably stiffer material than
the penny ice of the Italians, which it rivals in public
favour; and it is built up of variously flavoured layers.
Sold in halfpenny and also penny paper-covered

squares, kept until wanted in a circular metal refrigerating pot surrounded by broken ice, Hokey Pokey has
the advantage over its rival eaten from glasses, inasmuch as it can be carried away by the purchaser
and consumed at leisure.  Besides being variously
flavoured, Hokey Pokey is dreadfully sweet, dreadfully cold, and hard as a brick. It is whispered that
the not unwholesome Swede turnip, crushed into
pulp, has been known to form its base, in lieu of more
expensive supplies from the cow, whose complex
elaboration of cream from turnips is thus unceremoniously abridged.</p>
<p>Another summer cry recalls to memory a species .of
house decoration, which we may hope is rapidly
becoming a thing of the past. <quote>Ornaments for yer
fire stoves,</quote> are usually either cream-tinted willow
shavings, brightened by the interspersion of a few
gold threads, or mats thickly covered with rose-shaped
bows and streamers of gaily-coloured tissue papers.
Something more ornate, and not always in better
taste, is now the fashion; the trade therefore has
found its way from the streets to the shops, and the
old cry, <quote>Ornaments for yer fire stoves,</quote> is likely to
be seldomer heard.
Many of the old cries, dying out elsewhere, may
still be familiar, however, in the back streets of second

more than one in his possession, he is now seldom
seen with more than one on his head. Calling the
price before the quantity, though quite a recent innovation, or more probably the revival of an old style,
is almost universal. The cry of <quote>Fine warnuts, ten
a penny,</quote> is now <quote>A penny for ten, fine warnuts,</quote> or
<quote>A penny for 'arf a score, fine warnuts.</quote>
The cat's meat man has never, like some of his
colleagues, aspired to music, but apparently confines
himself to the one strident monosyllable. It has
been stated, by the way, that the London cats, of
which it seems there are at present some 350,000,
annually consume &#x00A3;1oo,ooo worth of boiled horse.

Until quite recently, the

of London Cries; while the piano-organ is a fresh
infliction in connection with the new order of street
noises. And although a sort of portable penthouse
was used in remote times for screening from heat and
rain, the ribbed and collapsible descendant thereof did
not come into general use much before the opening of
the present century; hence the cry, <quote>Any umbrellas-

<p>It has before been said that everything that could be carried has, at
some time or other, been sold in the
streets; and it follows that an
approximately  complete  list  of
London Cries would reach a very
large total. From its mere length
and sameness such a list would
moreover be apt to weary the reader;

<p>The bellows-mender, who sometimes also followed
the trade of a tinker, carried his tools and apparatus
buckled in a leathern bag at his back, and practised
his profession in any convenient corner of the street.
Door-mats of all shapes were made of rushes or
rope, and were sold at from sixpence to several shillings each.</p>
<p>The earliest green pea brought to the London
market-a dwarf variety-was distinguished by the
name of Hasteds, Hastens, Hastins, or Hastings, and

sold in the streets, and the cry of "green Hastings"

taken up separately or in fitful chorus by the men and
women of a travelling store. The Flemish <soCalled>Buy a
Broom</soCalled>  criers, whose trade is gone, generally went in
couples or threes.  Their figures are described by
Hone as exactly miniatured in the unpainted wooden
doll, shaped the same before and behind, and sold in
the toy shops for the amusement of the little ones. In
the comedy of <quote>The Three Ladies of London,</quote> printed
in quarto in Queen Elizabeth's reign (A.D. <date value="1584">1584</date>), is
this passage :-
<quote>Enter Conscience with brooms at her back, singing as follows:-
<lb/>New brooms, green brooms, will you buy any?
<lb/>Maydens come quickly, let me take a penny.</quote></p>
<p>Hot rolls, which were sold at one and two a penny,
were carried during the summer months between the
hours of 8 and 9 in the morning, and from 4 to 6 in
the afternoon.
<lb/>Let Fame puff her trumpet, for muffin and crumpet,
<lb/>They cannot compare with my dainty hot rolls;
<lb/>'When mornings are chilly, sweet Fanny, young Billy,
<lb/>Your hearts they will comfort, my gay little souls.</p>

<p>Muffins and crumpets were then, as now, principally
cried during the winter months.</p>

<p>Hot pudding, sweet, heavy and indigestible, was
sold in halfpenny slabs.
<lb/>Who wants some pudding nice and hot!

<lb/>Just taken from the smoking pot,
<lb/>And taste before you buy it.</p>

<p>The cry <quote>One-a-penny, two-a-penny, hot CROSS
BUNS !</quote> which,-now never heard from the sellers
on Good Friday,-is still part of a child's game, remains as one of the best instances of English quantitative metre, being repeated in measured time, and
not merely by the ordinary accent. The rhubarb-selling Turk, who appeared in turban, trousers, and
-what was then almost unknown amongst civilians
-moustaches, was, fifty years ago or more, a well-known character in the metropolis.</p>
<p>Sand was generally used in London, not only for
cleaning kitchen utensils, but for sprinkling over uncarpeted floors as a protection against dirty footsteps.
It was sold by measure-red sand, twopence half-penny, and white a penny farthing per peck. The
very melodious catch, <quote>White Sand and Grey Sand,
Who'll buy my White] Sand !</quote> was evidently harmonized on the sand-seller's traditional tune.
<quote>Buy a bill of the play !</quote> In the time of our great



<pb n="98" id="p.98"/>

grandfathers, there were no scented programmes, and
the peculiar odour of the play-bills was not due to the
skill of a Rimmel. Vilely printed with the stickiest of
ink, on the commonest of paper, they were disposed of
both in and outside the theatre by orange-women,
who would give one to a purchaser of half a dozen
oranges or so. In Hogarth's inimitably amusing and
characteristic print of <hi rend="italics">The Laughing Audience</hi>, a
couple of robustly built orange-women are contending,
with well-filled baskets, for the favour of a bewigged
beau of the period, who appears likely to become an
easy victim to their persuasions.</p>
<p><quote>Knives to Grind</quote> is still occasionally heard, and
the grinder's barrow (<hi rend="italics">vide</hi> that depicted in Rowlandson's illustration on p. 59), is much the same as it was
a hundred years ago. At the beginning of the century
the charge for grinding and setting scissors was a
penny or twopence a pair; penknives a penny a blade,
and table-knives one and sixpence and two shillings a
dozen.</p>
<p>Rabbits were carried about the streets suspended
at either end of a pole which rested on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The edible marine herb samphire, immortalized in
connection with <quote>Shakespeare's Cliff</quote> at Dover, was
at one time regularly culled and as regularly eaten.

only in verse. In Queen Elizabeth's time the
floors of churches as well as private houses were carpeted with rushes, and in Shakespeare's day the stage
was strewn with them.   Rush-bearing, a festival
having its origin in connection with the annual renewal of rushes in churches, was kept up until quite
recently, and may even still be practised in out-of-the
way villages.</p>
<p>The stock of the <soCalled>'arthstone</soCalled> woman, who is not
above doing a stroke of business in bones, bottles, and
kitchen stuff, is usually on a barrow, drawn by a
meek-eyed and habitually slow-paced donkey.</p>
<p>The London Barrow Woman (<quote>Ripe Cherries</quote>), as
preserved in the cut from the inimitable pencil of
George Cruikshank, has long since disappeared. In
<date value="1830">1830</date>, when this sketch was made, the artist had to
rely on his memory, for she then no longer plied her
trade in the streets. Her wares changed with the
seasons; but here a small schoolboy is being tempted
by ripe cherries tied on a stick. There being no importation of foreign fruit, the cherries were of prime
quality. May dukes, White heart, Black heart, and
the Kentish cherry, succeeded each other-and, when
sold by weight, and not tied on sticks, fetched sixpence,
fourpence, or threepence per lb., which was at least
twopence or threepence less than charged at the shops.

The poor Barrow Woman appears to have been treated
very much in the same manner as the modern costermonger; but was without his bulldog power of resistance. If she stopped to rest or solicit custom,
street keepers, <quote>authorized by orders unauthorized by
law,</quote> drove her off, or beadles overthrew her fruit
into the road.  Nevertheless, if Cruikshank has not
idealized his memories, she was more wholesomely and
stoutly clad than any street seller of her sex-with the
one exception of the milkmaid-who is to be seen in
our day, when the poor London woman has lost, the
instinct of neatness and finish in attire.</p>
<p><soCalled>Hot spiced gingerbread,</soCalled> still to be found in a
cold state at village fairs and junketings, used to be
sold in winter time in the form of flat oblong cakes at
a halfpenny each, but it has long since disappeared
from our streets.</p>
<p><quote>Tiddy Diddy Doll, lol, lol, lol</quote> was a celebrated
vendor of gingerbread, and, according to Hone, was
always hailed as the king of itinerant tradesmen. It
must be more than a century since this dandified
character ceased to amuse the populace. He dressed
as a person of rank-ruffled shirt, white silk stockings,
and fashionable laced suit of clothes surmounted by a
wig and cocked hat decorated with a feather. He was
sure to be found plying his trade on Lord Mayor's

<p>Fifty years ago <quote>Young Lambs to Sell, two for a

<pb n="106" id="p.106"/>
spangled with Dutch gilt. The head was
of composition, the cheeks were painted red, there
were two black spots to do duty for eyes, and the
horns and legs were of tin, which latter adornment,
my younger readers may suggest, foreshadowed the
insufficiently appreciated tinned mutton of a later
period. The addition of a bit of pink tape tied
round the neck by way of a collar made a graceful
finish, and might be accepted as a proof that the baby
sheep was perfectly tame.
<lb/>Young lambs to sell, young lambs to sell.

<p>The later song-
<lb/>Old chairs to mend, old chairs to mend.
<lb/>If I'd as much money as Icould spend,
<lb/>I'd leave off crying old chairs to mend-
-is obviously copied from the original cry of <quote>Young

consisted of rushes which in later days gave place to

ancient practice. The use of rush-bottomed chairs,
which are again coming into aesthetic fashion, cannot
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.016.DO01.00057"><head><quote>Buy my fine Myrtles and Roses!</quote></head></figure>
be traced back quite a century and a half. The chairs
in Queen Anne's time were seated and backed with
cane; and in the days of Elizabeth the seats were



<pb n="109" id="p.109"/>

cushioned and the backs stuffed. Many years ago an
old chair-mender occupied a position by a stone fixed
in the wall of one of the houses in Panyer Alley, on
which is cut the following inscription:-
 <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.016.DO01.00058"><head>When Y Have Sought...</head></figure></p>

<pb n="110" id="p.110"/>

<p>Being entirely unprotected and close to the ground,
this curious relic of bygone times, which is surmounted
by a boldly carved figure of a nude boy seated on a
panyer pressing a bunch of grapes between his hand
and foot, is naturally much defaced; and that it has
not been carried away piecemeal by iconoclastic
curiosity-hunters, is probably due to its out-of-the-way
position.  Panyer Alley, the most eastern turning
leading from Paternoster Row to Newgate Street,
slightly rises towards the middle; but is not, according to Mr. Loftie, an undoubted authority on all matters pertaining to old London, the highest point in the
city, there being higher ground both in Cornhill and
Cannon Street. In describing Panyer Alley, Stow indirectly alludes to a  <soCalled>signe</soCalled> therein, and it is Hone's
opinion that this stone may have been the ancient
sign let into the wall of a tavern. While the upper is
in fair preservation, the lower part of the inscription
can hardly be read. When last examined, a street
urchin was renovating the figure by a heartily-laid-on
surface decoration of white chalk; and unless one of
the numerous antiquarian or other learned societies
interested in old London relics will spare a few pounds
for the purchase of a protective grating, there will
shortly be nothing left worth preserving.</p>
<p><quote>New-laid eggs, eight a groat,</quote> takes us back to a



<pb n="111" id="p.111"/>

time when the best joints and fresh country butter
were both sixpence a pound.</p>
<p>Years ago the tin oven of the peripatetic penny pieman was found to be too small to meet the constant
and ever-increasing strain made upon its resources;
and the owner thereof has now risen to the dignity of
a shop, where, in addition to stewed eels, he dispenses
what Albert Smith happily termed <soCalled>covered uncertainties,</soCalled> containing messes of mutton, beef, or seasonable
fruit. Contained in a strong wicker basket with legs,
or in a sort of tin oven, the pieman's wares were formerly kept hot by means of a small charcoal fire. A
sip of a warm stomachic liquid of unknown but apparently acceptable constituents was sometimes offered
gratuitously by way of inducement to purchase. The
cry of <quote>Hot Pies</quote> still accompanies one of the first
and most elementary games of the modern baby learning to speak, who is taught by his nurse to raise his
hand to imitate a call now never heard.</p>
<p>The specimens of versification that follow are
culled from various books of London Cries, written
for the amusement of children, towards the end of the
last century, and now in the collection of the writer:

<div1 type="chapter" n="The Illustrations" id="c2"><head>The Illustrations.</head>
<p>Ten of the illustrations by that great master of the
art of caricature, Thomas Rowlandson, are copied in
<hi rend="italics">facsimile</hi> from a scarce set, fifty-four in all, published
in <date value="1820">1820</date>, entitled <quote>Characteristic Sketches of the
Lower Orders,</quote> to which there is a powerful preface,
as follows:-</p>
<p><quote>The British public must be already acquainted
with numerous productions from the inimitable pencil
of MR. ROWLANDSON, who has particularly distinguished himself in this department.
There is so much truth and genuine feeling in his



<pb n="118" id="p.118"/>

delineations of human character, that no one can
inspect the present collection without admiring his
masterly style of drawing and admitting his just claim
to originality. The great variety of countenance, expression, and situation, evince an active and lively
feeling, which he has so happily infused into the
drawings as to divest them of that broad caricature
which is too conspicuous in the works of those artists
who have followed his manner. Indeed, we may venture to assert that, since the time of Hogarth, no artist
has appeared in this country who could be considered
his superior or even his equal.</quote></p>
<p>The two illustrations- <quote>Lavender,</quote> with a background representing Temple Bar, and <quote>Fine Strawberries,</quote> with a view of Covent Garden-are from
<quote>Plates Representing the Itinerant Traders of London
in their ordinary Costume.  Printed in 1805 as a
supplement to <quote>Modern London</quote> (London: printed
for Charles Phillips, 71, St. Paul's Churchyard).</quote>
The set is chiefly interesting as representing London
scenes of the period; many parts of which are now
no longer recognisable.</p>
<p>The crudely drawn, but picturesquely treated <soCalled>Catnach</soCalled> cuts, from the celebrated Catnach press in
Seven Dials, now owned by Mr. W. S. Fortey, hardly
require separately indicating.</p>



<pb n="119" id="p.119"/>

<p>The four oval cuts, squared by the addition of perpendicular lines, <quote>Hot spice gingerbread!</quote> <quote>O' Clo !</quote>
 <quote>Knives to Grind !</quote> and  <quote>Cabbages O ! Turnips !</quote>
are facsimiled from a little twopenny book, entitled,
<quote>The Moving Market; or, Cries of London, for the
amusement of good children,</quote> published in <date value="1815">1815</date> by
J. Lumsden and Son, of Glasgow. It has a frontispiece representing a curious little four-in-hand carriage
with dogs in place of horses, underneath which is
printed this triplet:-
<lb/>See, girls and boys who learning prize,
<lb/>Round London drive to hear the cries,
<lb/>Then learn your Book and ride likewise.</p>
<p>The quaint cuts, <quote>Ere's yer toys for girls an' boys !</quote>
<quote>New-laid eggs, eight a groat,-crack 'em and try
'em ! </quote> <quote> Flowers, penny a bunch !</quote> (frontispiece), and
the three ballad singers, apparently taken from one of
the earliest chap-books, are really but of yesterday.
For these the writer is indebted to his friend, Mr.
Joseph Crawhall, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who uses his
cutting tools direct on the wood without any copy. Mr.
Crawhall's  <quote>Chap-book Chaplets,</quote> and  <quote>Olde ffrendes
wyth newe Faces,</quote> quaint quartos each with many
hundreds of hand-coloured cuts in his own peculiar
and inimitable style, and <quote>Izaak Walton, his Wallet
Booke,</quote> are fair examples of his skill in this direction.



<pb n="120" id="p.120"/>

Two plates unenclosed with borders- <quote>Old Chairs
to mend !</quote> and <quote>Buy a Live Goose?</quote> are from that
once common and now excessively scarce child's
book, <hi rend="italics">The Cries of London as they are Daily Practised</hi>, published in <date value="1804">1804</date> by J. Harris, the successor of
<soCalled>honest John Newbery</soCalled>, the well-known St. Paul's
Churchyard bookseller and publisher.</p>
<p>George Cruikshank's London Barrow-woman ( <quote>Ripe
Cherries</quote>), <quote>Tiddy Diddy Doll,</quote> and other cuts, are
from the original illustrations to Hone's delightful
<quote>Every-Day Book,</quote> recently republished by Messrs.
Ward, Lock &#x0026;  Co.</p>
<p>The cuts illustrating modern cries- <quote>Sw-e-e-p !</quote>;
<quote>Dust, 0 !</quote> ; <quote>Ow-oo !</quote>;   <quote>Fresh Cabbidge!</quote>;
and <quote>Stinking Fish !</quote> are from the facile pencil of
Mr. D. McEgan.</p>
<p>Finally, in regard to the business card of pussy's
butcher, the veracious chronicler is inclined to think
that an antiquarian might hesitate in pronouncing it to
be quite so genuine as it looks. This opinion coincides
with his own. In fact he made it himself. As a set-off,
however, to the confession, let it be said that this is
the sole <foreign lang="FR">fantaisie d'occasion</foreign> set down herein.</p></div1>

may be of interest to Mr. TUER:-

<lb/>Of Mowse Traps, and tormentors to kill Fleas.</quote>

<p>I notice a query from you in <hi rend="italics">N. and Q.</hi> about
a London Street Cry which troubles you. Many of
the curious adjuncts to Street Cries proper have, I
apprehend, originally no meaning beyond drawing
attention to the Crier by their whimsicality. I will
give you an instance. Soon after the union between
England and Ireland, a man with a sack on his back
went regularly about the larger streets of Dublin.
His cry was:
<quote><lb/>Bits of Brass,
<lb/>Broken Glass,
<lb/>Old Iron,
<lb/>Bad luck to you Castlereagh.</quote>



<pb n="123" id="p.123"/>

Party feeling against Lord Castlereagh ran very
high at the time, I believe, and the political adjunct.
to his cry probably brought the man more shillings
than he got by his regular calling.</p>
<p>H. G.W.</p>
<p>P.S.-I find I have unconsciously made a low pun.
The cry alluded to above would probably be understood and appreciated in the streets of Dublin at the
present with reference to the Repeal of the Union.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR,-</p>
<p>The <soCalled>Tormentor,</soCalled> concerning which you inquire
in <hi rend="italics">Notes and Queries</hi> of this date, was also known as
a <soCalled>Scratch-back,</soCalled> and specimens are occasionally to
be seen in the country. I recollect seeing one, of
superior make, many years ago. An ivory hand, the
fingers like those of <soCalled>Jasper Packlemerton of atrocious
memory,</soCalled> were <quote>curled as in the act of</quote> scratching,
a finely carved wrist-band of lace was the appropriate
ornament, and the whole was attached to a slender
ivory rod of say eighteen inches in length. The finger
nails were sharpened, and the instrument was thus
available for discomfiting <soCalled>back-biters,</soCalled> even when



<pb n="124" id="p.124"/>

engaged upon the most inaccessible portions of the
human superficies.  I have also seen a less costly
article of the same sort carved out of pear-wood (or
some similar material). It is probable that museums
might furnish examples of the <soCalled>back scratcher,</soCalled>

the meaning or origin of this curious street cry? I
have tried to trace it, but in vain. It occurs to me
as just possible that the following circumstance may
bear on it:-</p>
<p>The Japanese are annoyed a good deal with fleas.
They make little cages of bamboo-such I suppose
as a small bird cage or mouse-trap-containing plenty
of bars and perches inside. These bars they smear
over with bird-lime, and then take the cage to bed
with them. Is it not, as I say, just possible, that one



<pb n="125" id="p.125"/>

of our ancient mariners brought the idea home with
him and started it in London? If so, a maker of
bird cages or mouse-traps is likely to have put the idea
into execution, and cried his mouse-traps and <soCalled>flea
tormentors</soCalled>  in one breath.</p>

<p>25, ARGYLL ROAD, KENSINGTON, W.,</p>
<p><date value="1885-04-24">24th April, 1885.</date></p>
<p>DEAR MR. TUER,-</p>
<p>The Cockney sound of long a which is confused
with received <hi rend="italics">i</hi>, is very different from it, and where it
approaches that sound, the long <hi rend="italics">i</hi> is very broad, so
that there is no possibility of confusing them in a
Cockney's ear. But is the sound Cockney ? Granted
it is very prevalent in E. and N. London, yet it is
rarely found in W. and S.W. My belief is that it is
especially an Essex variety. There is no doubt about
its prevalence in Essex, so that [very roughly indeed]
<quote>I say</quote> there becomes <quote>oy sy.</quote> Then as regards
the <hi rend="italics">o</hi> and <hi rend="italics">ou</hi>. These are never pronounced alike.
The <hi rend="italics">o</hi> certainly often imitates received <hi rend="italics">ow</hi>, though it
has more distinctly an <hi rend="italics">o</hi> commencement; but when



<pb n="127" id="p.127"/>

that is the case, <hi rend="italics">ou</hi> has a totally different sound, which
dialect-writers usually mark as <hi rend="italics">aow</hi>, having a broad a
commencement, almost <hi rend="italics">a</hi> in <hi rend="italics">bad</hi>. Finer speakers-
shopmen and clerks-will use a finer a. The sound
of short <hi rend="italics">u</hi> in <hi rend="italics">nut</hi>, does not sound to me at all like <hi rend="italics">e</hi> in
<hi rend="italics">net</hi>. There are great varieties of this " natural vowel,"
as some people call it, and our received <hi rend="italics">nut</hi> is much
finer than the general southern provincial and northern
Scotch sounds, between which lie the mid and north
England sounds rhyming to <hi rend="italics">foot</hi> nearly, and various
transitional forms. Certainly the sounds of <hi rend="italics">nut</hi>, <hi rend="italics">gnat</hi>
are quite different, and are never confused by speakers;
yet you would write both as <hi rend="italics">net</hi>.</p>
<p>The pronunciation of the Metropolitan area is extremely mixed; no one form prevails. We may put
aside educated or received English as entirely artificial. The N., N.E., and E. districts all partake of
an East Anglian character; but whether that is recent,
or belongs to the Middle Anglian character of Middlesex, is difficult to say.  I was born in the N.
district, within the sound of Bow Bells (the Cockney
limits), over seventy years ago, and I do not recall the
<hi rend="italics">i</hi> pronunciation of <hi rend="italics">a</hi> in my boyish days, nor do I
recollect having seen it used by the older humourists.
Nor do I find it in <quote>Errors of Pronunciation and Improper Expressions, Used Frequently and Chiefly by the



<pb n="128" id="p.128"/>
Inhabitants of London,</quote> 1817, which likewise does not
note any pronunciation of <hi rend="italics">o</hi> like <hi rend="italics">ow</hi>. Hence I am
inclined to believe that both are modernisms, due to
the growing of London into the adjacent provinces.
They do not seem to me yet prevalent in the W.
districts, though the N.W. is transitional. South of
the Thames, in the S.W. districts, I think they are
practically unknown. In the S.E. districts, which dip
into N. Kent, the finer form of <hi rend="italics">aow</hi> for <hi rend="italics">ou</hi> is prevalent.
The uneducated of course form a mode of speech
among themselves.  But I am sorry to find even
school teachers much infected with the <hi rend="italics">i</hi>, <hi rend="italics">ow</hi>, <hi rend="italics">aow</hi>,
pronunciations of <hi rend="italics">a</hi>, <hi rend="italics">o</hi>, <hi rend="italics">ou</hi>, in N. districts.</p>
<p>Of course your Cockney orthography goes upon very
broad lines, and you are quite justified in raising a
laugh by apparent confusions, where no confusions are
made by the speakers themselves, as Hans Breitmann
did with the German. The confusion is only in our
ears. They speak a language we do not use. To
write the varieties of sounds, especially ot diphthongs,
with anything like correctness, requires a phonetic
alphabet which cannot even be read, much less written,
without great study, such as you cannot look for in
readers who want only to be amused. But another
question arises, Should we lay down a pronunciation ?
There never has been any authority capable of doing
so


<pb n="129" id="p.129"/>
so. Orthoepists may protest, but the fashion of pronunciation will again change, as it has changed so
often and so markedly during the last six hundred
years; see the proofs in my <hi rend="italics">Early English Pronunciation</hi>. Why should we not pronounce <hi rend="italics">a</hi> as we do <hi rend="italics">i</hi>,
pronouncing <hi rend="italics">i</hi> as we do <hi rend="italics">oy</hi> ? Why should we not call
<hi rend="italics">o</hi> as we now call <hi rend="italics">ow</hi>, pronouncing that as <hi rend="italics">aow</hi> ? Is not
our <hi rend="italics">a</hi> a change from <hi rend="italics">i</hi> (the German
<hi rend="italics">ei</hi>, <hi rend="italics">ai</hi>) in <hi rend="italics">say, away,
pain</hi>, etc. ? Is not our <hi rend="italics">ou</hi> a change from our sound of
<hi rend="italics">oo</hi> in <hi rend="italics">cow</hi>, etc. ? Again, our <hi rend="italics">oo</hi> replaces an old <hi rend="italics">oh</hi> sound.
There is nothing but fashion which rules this. But
when sounds are changed in one set of vowels, a compensating change takes places in another set, and so
no confusion results. In one part of Cheshire I met
with four sounds of <hi rend="italics">y</hi> in <hi rend="italics">my</hi>, never confused by natives,
although a received speaker hears only one, and all
arose from different sources. Why is one pronunciation <hi rend="italics">horrid</hi> (or aw-ud), and another not?  Simply
because they mark social grades. Of course I prefer
my own pronunciation, it's been my companion for so
many years. But others, just as much of course,
prefer theirs. When I brought out the <hi rend="italics">Phonetic News</hi>,
in phonetic spelling, many years ago, a newsvendor
asked me, <quote>Why write <hi rend="italics">neewz</hi> ? We always say <hi rend="italics">nooze</hi>.</quote></p>
<p>Very truly yours,</p>
<p>ALEXANDER J. ELLIS.</p>

" From Messrs. Field&#x0026; Tuer we have received some interesting
specimens, in red and brown, from the original copper-plates engraved
by Bartolozzi. Some of the ' Cupids' are perfect gems. The variety
is extensive, and well worth the attention of collectors. The beautiful
examples. mostly of a fanciful character, are direct impressions from
plates-all in fine condition-that have been gradually accumulated by
a well-known collector during the past twenty years. Although engraved nearly a century ago, some of the copper-plates have never
before been published, and are therefore in proof condition. These
engravings are not to be confounded with the faded reprints from worn-
out plates which for years past have disgusted the collector."--<hi rend="italics">Whitehall Review</hi>.</item>

The Author's Paper Pad (Issued by the
Proprietors of The Leadenhall Press). Contains, in block
form, fifty sheets of paper, fibrous and difficult to tear as a
piece of linen, over which-being of unusual but not painful
smoothness-the pen slips with perfect freedom. Easily
detachable, the size of the sheets is about 71 x 82 in., and
the price is only that usually charged for common scribbling
paper. THE AUTHOR'S PAPER PAD may be comfortably
used, whether at the desk, held in the hand, or resting on
the knee. As being most convenient for both author and
compositor, the paper is ruled the narrow way, and of
course on one side only.-<hi rend="italics">Sixpence each, 5/- per dozen, ruled
or plain</hi>.</item></list>
