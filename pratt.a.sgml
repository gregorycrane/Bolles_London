<head>A Haunt of Highwaymen.</head>



  <p>When the region around Clare Market was the
extreme west-end of London, and all beyond was
rusticity; when, as Thackeray wrote, the Edgware
Road was a road with tinkling waggons passing now
and then between fragrant walls of snowy hawthorn
blossoms; when the ploughman whistled over what
are now busy thoroughfares and the merry milkmaid
led the lowing kine amid green fields and sweet air-
then the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Old Black Jack,</q> in Portsmouth Street was
a roadside Inn far removed from any other habitation.
It requires a great stretch of imagination to picture
the grimy region about Clare Market as a rural
neighbourhood, yet there is undoubted proof that it
was so, even within the history of this old house,
which will soon be razed to the ground.
  <P>A curious history it is which attaches to it-or
rather it has had a curious series of historical associations. After highwaymen had ceased to use it as
their head-quarters it became a resort of gay gallants
as the district became more and more <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the west-end</q>
of the town, socially as well as geographically. As
the aristocracy migrated still further west, tile Inn
became the resort of medical students and foreigners
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">down on their luck</q>-notable among whom was
Prince Louis Napoleon, who was actually arrested for
debt within its walls. Since then the whole neighbourhood has been on the down grade. The grounds


<pb n=2>




surrounding the old Palaces and Mansions were cut
up into alleys on the most intricate and tortuous
principle. The lanes and thoroughfares were of the
narrowest, and the houses which were built had many
of them projecting upper stories, such as are to be seen
in old prints, through which people could shake hands.
Its reputation grew to be of the worst possible
character. Thieves made it their sanctuary, and the
police were chary of tracking them to their lairs.
Within a stone's throw of the Old Black Jack was
that most ill-conditioned of all London places, Chapel
Court, which for years rejoiced in the name of
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Murder Alley,</q> so evil was its reputation.  The
changes that have followed since the building of the
New Law Courts was begun, have done away with
this and many other places of little better repute.
But even now much remains to show how intricate
these passages were, while the legend is still extant
that the ghost of a young man from the country is to
be met on foggy nights wandering about in a vain
search for the Strand.
  <p>At the recent sale of effects of the Inn there were
sold relics both of Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard,
sufficiently well attested to fetch prices far above their
intrinsic value. They included a whip of the one and
a cast shoe of the horse of the other, the shoe being
the one alleged to have been cast on the journey to
York.   But Harrison Ainsworth surrounded the
career of Turpin with so many mythical circumstances-the ride to York was borrowed from the
life of a knight of the road of lesser repute-that
one is sceptical as to the relics; at all events, as far
as he is concerned. It may, however, be accepted as


<pb n=3>







beyond dispute that about the year <datestruct value="1731--"><year>1731</year></datestruct> Dick
Turpin-whose real name, by the bye, was Jack
Palmer-was a regular customer at the Black Jack,
though his chief rendezvous was at a tavern in Drury
Lane, believed to be the Cock and Pye.  His habit
was to hire a horse-Black Bess was evidently a
phantom steed-at the Old Leaping Bar in High
Holborn, and ride out to Oxford Road (now Oxford
Street), then a lonely and desolate region, and there
waylay his victims, almost under the very shadow of
the triple gallows at Tyburn. Among other relics
sold at the same time were the table at which Louis
Napoleon (who subsequently became Napoleon III).
sat when served with a writ for debt, and the chair on
which. he sat. There was also the chair on which
Joe Miller sat night after night, to be the butt of the
jokes of the real author of the Joe Millerisms handed
down to prosterity as emanating from him; the
ascribing of them to this dull, witless fellow, who sat
there night after night without opening his mouth,
having been designedly the biggest joke of all.
There is a tradition that Charles II., in his tavern
frequenting days, was also a constant visitor of mine
host at the Black Jack ; but, unfortunately for the
relic-hunters, there was no piece of furniture connected
with his visits.
  <p>Jack Sheppard is associated with the place by an
event which caused a temporary change of the
name of the Inn. This was when in <datestruct value="1741--"><year>1741</year></datestruct> Sheppard,
on his marvellous escape from the condemned cell at
Newgate, having got rid of his fetters in a private
house in Holborn, first visited the Cock and Pye in
Drury Lane, and not finding any of his associates



<pb n=4>







there, went on to the Black Jack. He had not been
there long, and was in the act of drinking his first
glass of ale at the bar, when the word was passed
that Jonathan Wild and his men were at the door.
Dashing upstairs with the runners after him, Sheppard
burst open the door of the front room on the first
floor, banged it to in the faces of his pursuers, opened,
the window, and leaping into the street, bounded away,
unhurt, across country and escaped for the time. In
consequence of this the place was known as the Jump,
and it was not until years afterwards that it reverted
to its original title. Though he got free at the time,
Sheppard could not keep away from his old haunts;
and Wild being laid up by the effects of a savage
attack made on him in the Old Bailey by a prisoner
in the dock, in presence of judge and jury, he visited
the Jump, with impunity. One night, however, when
he was there with two women, he sent for his mother,
and together they drank so much brandy that by
twelve o'clock Sheppard was helpless. Wild, leaving
his sick bed on obtaining information of the whereabouts
of the notorious criminal, easily effected his capture
and took him back to Newgate,where the enormously
heavy fetters, still perserved there as Jack Sheppard's
were fastened on him, leaving him no chance of again
breaking out. Sixteen days afterwards he was hanged
at Tyburn.
  <p>As to the attempt which has been made to connect
the Old Black Jack with the Magpie and Stump,
which Mr. Pickwick visited when in search of Mr.
Perker's clerk, it is unnecessary to say much Dickens
was undoubtedly acquainted with the place, and the
late landlord remembered his frequent visits. But






<pb n=5>
there is another house in the neighbourhood which is
considered to answer the description better.  This is
the George the Fourth, in Portugal Street, and those
who favour this. as the original of the Magpie and
Stump point to the fact that, as the house is a very old
one, it must have had another name before the time
of the last of the Georges. Why, they ask triumphantly, should it not have been the Magpie and Stump?
If this is not conclusive, at least no one has yet been
discovered who knows to the contrary.

<HEAD>The Romance of Milbank.<note type=foot n=1>Since this article was written the Prison has disappeared and
the Tate Picture Gallery been built on its site.</note></HEAD>

  <p>When Jeremy Bentham fixed upon the present site
of Milbank Prison for his amazing    panopticon
scheme-which, though it proved abortive, led ultimately to the building of the Penitentiary, which in
its turn is to give way to a curious agglomeration of
art gallery, military barracks, and workmen's
dwellings-he gave as his excuse that it was in <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">no
neighbourhood at all.</q>  There were no residents to
whom its presence would be objectionable; and, if
damp and noisome, its prospective inhabitants would
have no great ground for grumbling. It was, in fact,
a quagmire famous in the days of sportsmen of
a generation ago for its snipe; and took its name
from an old mill which existed there in the days when
Westminster had an Abbot, to whom the mill
belonged.  Its nearest neighbours were the old
Greencoats Hospital, a number of ancient almshouses, and other places of worse repute; so that
there was no local prejudice of any weight against
the proposed building of a Penitentiary. Much the
same argument as that of Bentham has been used by
many as regards the proposed utizilation of a part of
the site for the Tate Picture Gallery: though in this
case it has been against the place rather than for it. It is
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">no neighbourhood at all,</q> say many people for a picture





<pb n=7>

gallery, not because it is an undrained morass, but because however imposing the new edifice may look form
a distance, and across the water-and it will not need
much architectural skill to improve on <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Peppercastor
Prison</q>-it must necessarily continue to exist in
more or less squalid surroundings; the neighbourhood being devoted to wharves and tumble-down
tenements, where for the most part the poorest of the
poor eke out a miserable existence.  In view of the
announcement that Mr. Shaw-Lefevre has placed the
sale of the Prison in the hands of a firm of
auctioneers, who will commence the sale of the old
walls on the 13th inst., a brief account of its history
may be read with interest.
  <p>As to its origin, that has been told by Captain
Griffiths, its historian, and once its Governor. It was
about the period of Waterloo, when prisoners were so
plentiful that the country did not know what to do
with them, and any wild visionary scheme met with
greater consideration than it deserved. That was so
in the case of Bentham, who actually proposed to
make a sort of zoological exhibition of the prisoners
for the edification of the masses.  His Panopticon
was to be a sort of huge iron cage, glazed, with a glass
lantern as large as Ranelagh, the cells being round the
outer circumference, so that all the prisoners would be
under view from a central point.  This scheme met
with considerable support from the authorities-impossible as it would seem in these days-and it would
doubtless have been carried out but for the use of the
Royal veto.  Nevertheless, the scheme was so long
under discussion, and appeared so likely to be tried,
that Bentham went to the length of buying a site for





<pb n=8>







it, and when it was knocked on the head the
authorities took over the site, and bought him out.
A most unpromising site it was, too.  There was
absolutely no natural foundation on which a building
of any size could be erected. The greatest difficulty
was experienced in making a start; and when a start
had been made by dint of driving piles into the peat
and loose stones, and ramming rubble between them
to the depth of two feet, part of the building came
tumbling down about the ears of the builders before
they had finished their work. Other contractors had
to be called in, and at length, by means of brick
courses and cement, a sufficiently stable foundation
was made, and the Prison-Penitentiary, rather, it
was at first-was occupied.
  <p>Even before all the cells were filled, cracks and
crevices appeared in the walls ; and soon afterwards
began the incidents which have made the Prison
famous. The first was a riot of the prisoners. They
objected to eat brown bread, which for some reason
was substituted for white, got up demonstrations
among themselves, and improvised banners, bearing
the words <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Give us our daily bread.</q>  They broke
the windows of their cells, and smashed the scanty furniture with which they were supplied. The public at
once rushed to the conclusion that the prisoners had
been pampered, and the authorities, taking the same
view, adopted the most stringent measures. The riot
quelled, solid meat was removed from the dietary
altogether, the prisoners being given instead <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">oxhead</q> soup, and that not too stimulating, as one
oxhead was made to flavour the stew for a hundred
prisoners.  Potatoes, too, were stopped, and beyond







<pb n=9>



the soup all that was given was skilly and bread. All
went well for a time.  The prisoners had no energy
to fight; but just when the authorities were congratulating themselves on the success of their
manoeuvre, a new   difficulty cropped  up.  The
prisoners, one after another, with the usual depravity
and wantonness of their class, fell ill.  All of them
got <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">scurvy,</q> and many of them had a peculiar
disease to which the doctors, for the want of a better
name gave that of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">slow cholera.</q>
  <p>Then came another agitation. The prisoners were,
it was said, being slowly starved to death.  Everyone was sympathetic in a moment. Not only was the
meat restored to the daily bill of fare, but dessert was
added in the form of a plentiful supply of oranges.
The prisoners, too, were to have a change of air,
being carted off to Woolwich hulks, where they
appear to have enjoyed themselves amazingly, recovering health, spirits, and mischievousness.
Meanwhile the prison was cleaned and fumigated, and then
the prisoners were all brought back. One would have
thought that after this affecting display of humanity
all would have gone on happily.  But prisoners, apparently, are never satisfied. In a very little time
there broke out an epedemic of suicide. The warders
went from cell to cell, only to find the inmates hanging by their braces, or some other article, behind the
doors.  Much time was occupied in resuscitating the
half-dead, and though it was freely commented on
afterwards it does not seem to have been noticed at
first that, curiously enough, the would-be suicides
always chose as the time to hang themselves a few
seconds before they knew they would be visited.





<pb n=10>







When at last the officials noticed this peculiarity they
were able to put a speedy stop to the epidemic by
resorting to the use of the dark cells; and another
period of quietude followed.  But it was only while
the malcontents were maturing fresh plans.  Space
will not permit any details of the next episode-the
conspiracy for a general riot, which led to an application to Parliament
for power to use the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">cat</q> on
refractory prisoners, which was not then allowed. It
is impossible, however, to pass over the satirical
comment of the prisoners, who killed the infirmary
warder's cat, and hung it up outside his door, with an
inscription threatening personal violence. The threat,
unhappily, was hot a mere <foreign lang=la>brutum fulmen</foreign>, for in a
few months there was a series of murderous assaults
on warders, with the result that the Flogging Act was
passed hurriedly through Parliament, and temporary
quietude was again restored after one or two trials of
the new remedy.
  <p>Now comes the most curious incident in the history
of the place.  Rioting being repressed with a firm
hand, and the warders being now too wide awake for
the suicide trick, the prisoners took to love-making.
This was not the period of the separate cell system;
but even then the males and females were kept apart,
and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">spooning</q> was not possible in the corridors or
exercise yards.  But the prisoners at Millbank were
ever fruitful in expedients.  The male prisoners, of
course, knew that the women were employed in washing the clothes, and in the first instance a letter was
sent among the clothes.  It fell into sympathetic
hands, and soon a regular system of love-making was
in full swing.  It is even on record that courtships






<pb n=11>



opened in this unpromising way ended in the bonds
of matrimony in due course.  One extract from a
letter which afterwards came to light will serve to
show that this love-making was not merely <foreign lang=fr>pour
passer le temps</foreign>. The letter was addressed <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">From the
young man that wrote first to the young woman that
wrote last.</q> One wonders that the obviously possible
complications of such a system of courtship have not
commended itself to our novelists.  However, the
reality is more strange than any fiction could be, and,
at all events, the letter was an eminently sensible one,
if written with questionable orthography, and of the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">How-happy-I-could-be-with-either</q> school.  It
reads : <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It is not from the pleasure received from our
corresponding that I venture to commit myself to
your's and your friend's generosity; but it is from
the real expectation of being joined to one of you.
and to lead an honest, industrious life. . . . So,
my dear, if your heart be disposed to acknowledge a
sympathy with mine, I myself am not very particular
about having a handsome wife; for many pretty girls
are so sensible of their own beauty that it makes their
manner odious; so long as you are a tidy-looking girl,
and industriously inclined, with a good disposition,
and will love me and me only; but, if any other man
is your intended I beg you to give me a true answer
in reply to this.</q>  What the young woman's answer
was must remain unknown, but subsequent revelations showed that this system of clandestine courtship
prevailed throughout the prison, and affected even the
servants of the officers who lived in it.
  <p>After these samples from the incidents of the early
history of Milbank, it will not be surprising to any





<pb n=12>
one that the Penitentiary system was a failure. Nor
will it be worth while to pursue an inquiry into the
subsequent use of the place-as a depot for convicts
awaiting transportation, and, lastly, as a prison for
women.   It may, however, be remarked, in conclusion, that in its time Millbank has housed all sorts
and conditions of men.  At one time, it is stated,
there were confined within its walls one baronet, two
captains, four clergymen, a solicitor, and several
doctors; while some of the most notable criminals of
the day have passed a period of detention among its
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">crown of towers.</q>

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=3>
<HEAD>Romance of a London Tavern.</HEAD>



  <p>An announcement that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Dirty Dick's</q>-or the
D.D. Cellars as it is now called--in Bishopsgate Street
Without, was to be brought under the auctioneer's
hammer, revived interest in this old tavern, which for
the best part of a century has figured in London story..
There is a good deal of discrepancy in the various
histories of the place which have been published from
time to time in prose and verse, but the one point of
interest, it has had for recent generations is that
there are still relics of the old place to be seen.
These relics, to say the least, are curious, and in past
years thousands   of visitors to  London   have
patronised the old bar to see what remains to
illustrate the story of one of London's most singular
characters.  The interest excited is that of mere
curiosity, rather than that of the antiquarian; but.
whatever becomes of the old tavern, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Dirty Dick's,</q>
is not likely to be readily forgotten.
  <p>The story of the place was written by Charles
Dickens for <title><hi rend=italic>Household Words</hi></title>, and a reprint of it is
still given away at the cellars. It differs considerably
from that related by Timbs in his <title>Romance of
London</title>; and from the story as told from  other
sources by William  Allingham  in <title>The Dirty Old
Man: A Lay of Leadenhall.</title>  There are various
other accounts in books dealing with the history of
London. All agree that the origin of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Dirty Dick's</q>




<pb n=14>




was a love affair, though they disagree on thepoint
whether <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Dick's</q> dirty habits were the result of a
constitutional distaste for cleanliness; or were due
solely to the baulking of his matrimonial intentions.
Timbs declares that in his early days Dirty Dick whose
real name, by the way, was Nathanial Bently-was
the beau of the district, and that he might be seen at
public places of resort dressed as a man of fashion.
He not only spoke French and Italian fluently, but
his demeanour was that of a polished gentleman.
Dickens also speaks of his having been <quote>quite a
dandy; always appearing in the most fashionable
attire, and with his hair arranged by a Court perruquier.</quote> But Dickens adds his inability to discover
whence the change arose, rather inclining to the
belief that it was a gradual decadence, <quote rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">for while he
continued to appear in public splendidly attired, he at
home grew negligent.</quote> When remonstrated with on
his uncleanliness, he would reply <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It's of no use; if I
wash my hands to-day they will be dirty again tomorrow.</q>
  <p>It was apparentlyabout this time that Bently was
to be married to the daughter of a wealthy citizen.
He had invited his intended bride and many friends
tb a feast. Butat thevery moment that the dinner table
was laden with good things, he received the news of
the death of his intended bride. He ordered the
dining-room to be shut up, and resolved that it
Should never be opened again during his lifetime.
The feast was left to decay; and for forty years no
one ever opened the door of the room. Bently gave
himself up to dirt and discomfort. He lived the life
of a miser; mended his own clothes, and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the once







<pb n=15>

fashionable beau</q> became the inveterate enemy of
soap and towels. His shop, too, was given over to
cobwebs and dust; but still.
                <quote><l>Though the dirt was so frightful,
      <l>The dirty man's manners were truly delightful.</quote>

  <p>The place soon became a curiosity. People came
from far and near to see <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Dirty Dick</q> and the
wonderfully developed specimens of cobwebs which
were in the course of years to be seen all over the
place.  For forty years he conducted his business
amid the cobwebs and dust, until he died in <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the
odour of dirt</q> in the year <datestruct value="1809--"><year>1809</year></datestruct>, leaving an ample
fortune to his heirs. When he died the house was in
a ruinous condition. In the locked room, which he
had so zealously guarded that he employed a man
to keep out impertinent intruders, the layers of dust
were so thick that scarce anything could be recognized; though <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the worm eaten table, with the plate,
cutlery, and dishes, as well as the gilt chains and
lustres, even in the general ruin which, prevailed
showed that the furniture had been once of a costly
and elegant character.</q>
  <p>On the death of Dirty Dick the place became a
tavern, and its reputation brought so many customers
that an attempt was made to preserve as much of
the place, andthe relics of its original occupant as
possible.  Up to <datestruct value="1870--"><year>1870</year></datestruct> there still remained <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the
venerable cobwebs with which the place had
become   festooned.</q>  But in   that  year  the
front and upper portion of the premises were
condemned by the civic authorities as dangerous, and   in  the  partial  rebuilding  of  the





<pb n=16>

place much had to be removed.    N ow, through
natural decay and other causes, not much remains.
The Inn has a modern brick front, and the
interior, though rather dingy, has but few relics of its
ancient condition,  Part of the old ceiling is still
pointed out.  It is begrimed with dirt and cracked,
but all the cobwebs are gone.  Behind one of the
bars are some singular relics which have been saved,
including some mummified cats, which were found
during the rebuilding operations, some fine old
crusted bottles, and some articles of a miscellaneous
character. There is also some of the old worm-eaten
woodwork, which, together with the other relics, is so
begrimed with dirt as to give circumstantial evidence
of the truth of the story.  Some of the old walls still
remain, and help to give the place a gloomy look.

<HEAD>A Relic of the Gordon Riots.</HEAD>



  <p>Sardinia Chapel, in Lincoln's Inn-fields, which has
been scheduled as required by the London County
Council for the new street between Holborn and the
Strand, has claims to rank as one of the old buildings
of London most richly endowed with historic interest.
Though described as a relic of the Gordon Riots, it
may be spoken of as a relic of Old London, part of
the existing building dating back to the 17th century
and having passed through striking vicissitudes.  But
it is with the No Popery Riots organised by Lord
George Gordon that it is mainly associated in history.
Part of the original building, which was twice burned
and looted by the mob, still remains, though the
larger part of the chapel and adjacent building only
dates back to that period when they were restored
and enlarged at the cost of the nation. Even before
that time the chapel had already a history, and had
passed through stirring episodes, including that sacking of the Catholic Chapels which followed
immediately on the announcement that the Prince of
Orange had landed at Brixham, on <datestruct value="1688-11-04"><month reg=11>November</month> <day reg=04>4</day>, <year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>,
when a desperate and continued attack was made for
a day and night on the Franciscans who lived in the
building now used as a Presbytery and was only
stopped by a guard of infantry and cavalry sent by
the King.




<pb n=18>




<p>This is the oldest Catholic Chapel, continuously
used as such, in London, having been built in <datestruct value="1648--"><year>1648</year></datestruct>.
It should be added that it was erected even before
the Mansion which existed in <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Fields</q> came to
be used as the Sardinian Embassy, and while it was
still the town residence of the Countess of Bath. The
Fields are mentioned in connection with Roman
Catholicism as early as <datestruct value="1588--"><year>1588</year></datestruct>, when a priest and a
layman were in the reign of Elizabeth, executed there
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">on a new pair of gallows,</q> by being hanged, drawn,
and quartered. From that time to the present the
place has always been connected with Romanism. It
was exactly a century afterwards that the first anti-
popery attack was made on the place; and another
century, all but eight years, later that the Gordon Riots
broke out on the passing of the Act which permitted
Roman Catholics to take the oath of allegiance without the religious test, and on the rumour that other
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">indulgences</q> were to be allowed. The periods both
before and after these riots were times of great
difficulty for the Roman Catholics; and many are the
stories told-some fabulous, but having a substratum
of truth-of how the services were for a long time
held in the tap-room of the Ship Public House, in the
neighbourhood, the Bishop arriving in the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">coloured
clothes</q> of an ordinary citizen, and exhorting his
flock with a pipe in his hand, and a foaming mug of
beer in front of him, in order to delude any chance
arrivals; themembers of the congregation, too, sitting
round the table with pipe and glass as though engaged
in an ordinary tap-room discussion. That this took
place as a regular custom for a long time is beyond
dispute; and at the Ship is still preserved the snuffbox








<pb n=19>



of Bishop Challoner, who was Bishop at that
time.
  <p>Viewing the Chapel from the outside no one would
suppose it tobe a building of any importance. Anything more unecclesiastical it would be difficult to
imagine than the long, almost windowless wall, with
curious angles, which accentuate its other cumbrous
features; but this is accountable for by the fact that
when it was built the persecution of the Catholics
was so unrelenting that the more a Church could be
made to resemble a stable or factory the more likely
it would be to escape notice. When it came to be
reconstructed and enlarged after the Gordon riots,
Inigo Jones added the heavy stone archway at the
end of what was thep Duke Street, but which is now
known as Sardinia Street-one of the most clumsy
pieces of work he ever perpetrated. Inside, however,
the Chapel is really ornate-much money having
been spent upon it-and the absence of windows adds
that dim, religious light, which enables one the better
to appreciate the dark pannelling and very fine woodwork, constituting an admirable foil to the bright
colours and lights of the altars, and the side chapels,
by which the angularities of the walls are hidden.
The double galleries give it a quaint appearance, and
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">quality</q> gallery still excites the attention of the
curious, as being the place where for centuries the
grandees have sat.  There is also the ambassador's
pew, handsomely constructed in mahogany, with a
special staircase, shut off from the Church, used by
many illustrious persons, among whom is counted
Victor Emmanuel, King of Sardinia.
  <p>From a story of the sacking of the Chapel, as told
in the <title>Political Magazine</title> of that date, it appears that





<pb n=20>






the mob broke open the door of the Chapel, and
pulled down the rails, seats, and other woodwork,
with which they made a bonfire near the door. This
was about ten o'clock in the morning.  In about
twenty minutes the Chapel caught fire, and the mob
would not let anyone extinguish it.  About eleven
o'clock the guards came and the engines began to
play, but by noon the interior of the Chapel was
destroyed, and the house over the gate was much
damaged.   On the following day the house of Mr.
Maberly, in Little Queen Street, was gutted, in consequence of his having given evidence against the
rioters, and a number of Popish Chapels, together
with the houses of Lord Petre and others, were
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">among the triumphs of the night.</q> Two days later,
on <datestruct value="-06-04"><day type=name>Sunday</day>, <month reg=06>June</month> <day type=number>4</day></datestruct>, the Sardinian Chapel was again
attacked.  The repairs already accomplished were
destroyed, and the mob was about to finish the work
of demolition when the guards arrived from Somerset
House.  One incident of the riot is very curious.
While it was in full swing a Jesuit father went, in
company with an Anglican clergyman, to view the
burning chapel; the mob, in its blind rage, mistook
the clergyman for a priest, and despite his protestations, was about to throw him into the burning
building when the Jesuit, who was of commanding
appearance, and, in accordance with the necessities of
the time, was dressed in ordinary costume, stepped
forward and assured the rabble that the supposed
priest was a clergyman of the English Church-the
Jesuit thus saving the life of the parson.
  <p>After the rebuilding of the Chapel it continued up
to the end of the first quarter of the present century





<pb n=21>
to be the centre of Roman Catholicism.  Even since
that period, when Dr. Baldacconi was missionary
rector, the chapel had a very fine choir, and in the
great festivals Lablache, Rubini, Tamburini, Grisi,
Persiani, and other Italian opera singers attracted
large and fashionable congregations. It has also one
of the finest organs to be met with in any place of
worship in London; and though it is situated in a
poor and squalid neighbourhood-once a notorious
rendezvous for thieves-it still attracts good congregations, and the priests do a great deal to mitigate
the lot of the poor people who crowd the tumble-down
houses in the vicinity.

<HEAD>The Art and Practice of Forgery.</HEAD>
  <p>On the principle of setting a thief to catch a thief,
it is best to go to an expert in forgery for information as to how it
is done. Such an opportunity presented itself the other day, and as the information
obtained not only throws a considerable light upon the
forger's artfulness as well as upon his art, it may be
well to give some of the details by way of warning to
those whose carelessness and want of knowledge of
the forger's ways enable him to pursue his calling
with conspicuous success. This, of course, refers to
the forging of cheques. The falsification of accounts,
the altering of valuable documents, come under the
same category, and to a large extent are effected by
the same method of manipulation; but in these cases
the forger has to rely upon his own wit rather than
upon the heedlessness and gullibility of others. It
is in the manipulation of cheques that forgery
has been brought to a fine art, and it is amazing to
see with what ease and safety enormous hauls can be
made.
  <p>But first let us take a lesson in forgery. Imagine
yourself in a small room, furnished as an office. You
are invited to take a seat at a table, on which is a
cheque made out to someone for a small sum. Close
to it is an ounce bottle, filled- with a white liquid, a
fine camel-hair brush, and a sixpenny box of water-
colours. This is the forger's stock-in-trade. And here




<pb n=23>



comes the first revelation of the art. The professional
expert does not get a blank cheque and fill it in,
laboriously simulating someone's signature. He knows
that there are little marks upon a cheque, slight
trivialities, which he may overlook, but which would
lead to detection. And then the imitation of the
signature is so difficult, whereas the manipulation of
the cheque is so easy. You watch him as he takes
the cork from the bottle, dips into the liquid the
camel's-hair brush, and then deftly traces over the
figures and writing which he wishes to efface. As if
by magic, the ink-writing disappears. You notice,
too, that with the ink there has also disappeared some
of the coloured pattern upon the cheque-in this case,
pink-and you point this out to the forger, who is still
painting out the lettering. He admits it at once.
Cheques are printed in that way, he tells you, as a
safeguard, so that any attempt to take out the ink
would also remove the colouring, and so, bankers
fondly hoped, would lead at once to detection. But
our forger does not seem in the least troubled by this
reflection. When all the writing he wants removed
has gone, he lets the cheque dry, and then fills it up
once more. " The cheque for &pound;21 10s. has become a
cheque for &pound;2,150 10s. But there are plainly perceptible upon it the little white patches where the pink
colouring has been removed. He then takes up the
sixpenny box of water-colours, calmly mixes a pink
that matches the pink of the cheque, and then caretully stipples over the white patches, imitating as far
as possible the original pattern. To ordinary observation there is nothing now noticeable, but he admits
that if examined with a glass in a good light it might






<pb n=24>




24



be noticed. But it is part of the forger's artfulness
never to present a cheque over the banker's counter.
He not being known, it is sure to be looked at closely.
So he pays it into a bank, or gets rid of it in other
ways, of which more hereafter. The crossing of a
cheque has no terror for him ; if it is not crossed, he
will cross it himself. Here is the forged cheque, and
you are bound to admit that there is nothing to excite
suspicion in its appearance. The falsification has been
done in a few minutes, with the most ordinary skill
imaginable. Will he tell you what the white fluid is?
Certainly; there is no secret about it. It is simply
chlorine water, such as is sold in stationers' shops for
removing ink blots. Or you can make it yourself.
Get a pinch of chloride of lime, such as is used for
disinfecting. Put it in a bottle, fill it up with water;
shake it and leave it till morning. It gives off a
volatile gas, which is chlorine gas. In the morning
there will be a milky-white fluid, with a little sediment
at the bottom. This chlorine water is what is used.
  <p>Having shown how the cheque is manipulated, he
proceeds to tell you of the various methods of putting
the art into practice.  One of the most striking
instances is a case which is still agitating the Berlin
police. Only a little time ago a man went into a
large bank at Berlin, and, with an admirable assumption of being a greenhorn in money matters, said he
wanted them to send for him &pound;13,000 to Melbourne.
He was, he said, emigrating to Australia, and did not
want to carry the money about with him. Could they
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">express</q> it for him to Melbourne, so that when he
reached his destination he could draw it out? He was
told he might buy a draft, and when he got to Melbourne,









<pb n=25>



the bank's agents there would cash it for him.
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Oh, but,</q> he remarked, with an admirable assumption
of guilelessness, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">I have my money here; and I want
this same money when I get the other side. I don't
know anything about drafts.</q> And so he went on, the
bank manager finding it difficult to explain to him
that his money would be safe; he was so fearful of
losing it. At last he completed the negotiation, and
paid over the &pound;13,000, all in good notes. These men
always operate on a large scale. The possession of a
large sum of money disarms suspicion. This operation
being accomplished, the man suddenly remembered
that he must send &pound;12 to someone, could they let him
have a draft for &pound;12 also? Of course this was done,
and the &pound;12 draft was the next number to the one
for &pound;13,000. Having secured these, he went to his
hotel, and the next operation was to alter the &pound;12
draft. He altered the amount to &pound;13,000 in the way
we have seen, and also altered the number of the
draft, well-knowing that all drafts are notified by number. Then he went to his port of embarkation for
Australia, where the vessel lay on which he had taken
his passage. But before going on board he visited
the biggest local bank. Having asked to see the
manager, he explained to him that having intended to
go on to Australia, he had bought this draft, producing the good one ; but that he had been recalled by
telegram from America, would it be possible to get
the draft cashed without his going back to Berlin?
To show his bona fides he offered to leave the draft
for an hour or two and pay the telegraphing charges.
Under the circumstances, there was no difficulty; the
draft was good, and the money was paid. So far, he

<pb n=26>







had only got his money back. But he had also the
forged draft for &pound;13,000. He knew that the draft
would be advised at once to Melbourne by the boat he
was travelling by, whereas the letter cancelling the
advice would be too late, for that post, and would go
on by the next boat. He accordingly travelled to
Melbourne; went straight to the bank there, and the
draft being fully advised, he got the money and disappeared. This was only found out a few weeks ago,
and, so far, there is no clue to the man.
  <p>A very similar case occurred in Liverpool and
London recently. In this case drafts were obtained
in much the same way, one for several hundreds, and
one for a small amount. In this case the draft for the
small amount having been altered to imitate the one
for a large amount was first cashed. Then the forger
came to London, and bought some shares of a stockbroker. After one or two transactions, during which
he showed he had plenty of money, he said he had
been called away, paid for the shares by the good
draft, got a cheque for the difference, and was no more
heard of. In the usual three days the draft was
returned to the stockbroker as a forgery, but it being
found to be the real draft, the bank had to bear the
loss.
  <p>This sort of case requires tact and discretion;
but it is a simple thing to get rid of forged cheques.
The forger goes to a hotel, takes rooms for some days,
and shortly afterwards asks the manager to pass some
cheques through his bank, and give him the money
when the cheques have been honoured. There is
nothing to excite suspicion in this; it has a look of
honesty about it, The cheque being received at the









<pb n=27>



bank with a lot of others is scarcely looked at. It is
passed on to the drawer's bank, and is duly honoured,
and it is not until some time afterwards, when the
paid cheques are returned to the man who originally
drew them, that the alteration in the amount is discovered. By that time the forger has disappeared.
Another way is for the forger to open a banking
account in another name and pay in the forged
cheques himself. This is a common proceeding with
defaulting clerks. Only recently there was a case at
Pontefract, where a solicitor's clerk obtained cheques
and paid them into his own bank. To cross a cheque
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">to account of Payee</q> is generally regarded as a safe-
guard against this sort of thing, but in such a case it
is only necessary to alter the name of the person to
whom the cheque is made out. But even that is not
absolutely necessary, for many bankers do not pay
any more attention to that injunction than they do to
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">not negotiable.</q> This leads up to the point of
how careless people are with regard to cheques.
However careful a firm may be with the chequebook, and with the examination of cheques before
signing, it is very rarely any special care is taken
of them afterwards. They are thrown into a basket
with other letters to post, and sent to be posted
by a clerk; so that the abstraction of cheques
for small amounts is an easy matter, whereas the
detection of the culprit is very difficult, especially if
he is wary in his manner of disposing of the cheques
when he has altered the amounts. And it is not only
cheques and drafts, but dividend coupons that are
altered. Perhaps the most startling case of this kind
was a man who some time ago altered a coupon and





<pb n=28>







obtained &pound;50,000 from the Bank of England.  He
tried it again, but they were on the watch for him,
and he was caught. This man, who was regarded as
a King of Forgers, was said to have secured no less
a sum than two millions sterling in this way.  It
seems incredible, but i is well known that large sums
are obtained.  Not only is a man with plenty of
money less an object of suspicion than a man with
none, but a man who operates largely can the more
readily get rid of his forgeries.  He gets among
stockbrokers and financial people accustomed to deal
with large amounts and cheques, and bank drafts are
changed, or taken in payment for shares, with little or
no enquiry.
  <p>Turning at last to the possibility of preventing
these frauds, the expert said that all the printers of
cheques advertised that they used specially prepared
papers which resisted acids, but there were none
which could not be altered. All sorts of precautions
had been invented from time to time. One of the
most popular was to perforate the cheque with figures
corresponding to the amount written on the cheque.
But the ingenuity of the forger is equal to this trial
of his skill. Some of the letters lend themselves very
readily to alteration.  A <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">3,</q> for instance, by the
addition of a couple of holes, becomes 8, and nothing
has been devised which does not permit of easy
alteration. Only recently a cheque made out by the
Societe Generale of Paris for &pound;48 was altered to
&pound;4,800. The figures in this case were originally <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">2.
&pound;48 0. 0.</q> Theinitial figure indicated that the draft
was for a sum of two figures. The forger had, therefore, to alter that, and preserve the delicate sea-green





<pb n=29>
tint of the Societe Generale's cheques.  This was,
however, successfully accomplished. It is impossible
to detect by ordinary observation that it has been
tampered with.  It is satisfactory, however, to find
that there is one invention that has defied the forger's
art; that is a machine which cuts the figures out
bodily, instead of indicating them by perforation. It
cuts out so much of the cheque that it is impossible
to tamper with it in any way. When this comes into
general use, as no doubt it will, virtue will be once
more triumphant, and once again will villainy be
vanquished.

<HEAD>The Clapper-Carrier.</HEAD>

  <p>Only those acquainted with the seamy side of
London life will recognise under this designation that
common object of the gutter, the sandwich-board
man. It is peculiarly a slang term, but it is in
common use among the down-at-heel fraternity, not
one of whom would ever use the word sandwich either
as applied to themselves or their calling. It may be
that they consider clapper-carrier as indicating a
complete portion of humanity, whereas the better-
known name indicates the third part of a human
sandwich. Or it may be that it has a deeper meaning. The clapper-carrier is, of all the humble callings
in town life, distinctly that of the men who have
fallen to their low estate from a higher sphere, and it
may be that the tabooed name recalls to them that
Lord Sandwich, to whom it owes its origin, who,
sitting at the gaming table for days at a stretch,
invented the method of eating meat between pieces of
bread to prevent the necessity of stopping the play to
have a proper meal. Whether it is due to the
associations of the name, which remind them of their
own folly, or its seeming to convey a reproach, it is
beyond contradiction that the individual himself,
whether he patronises a twopenny rope or rises to the
distinction of a fourpenny doss in a common lodging-
house, is among his fellows a clapper-carrier, and not
a sandwich-board man.









<pb n=31>



  <p>By whatever name he is called, there is no disputing that it is a very bad season for him. Clapper-
carrying is influenced by the weather. Not that the
wretchedly-clad objects who depend upon it care
whether it hails or rains. They may as well shiver
between two boards all day, with the prospect of some
food and a humble couch at their own expense at
night, as freeze at the street corners without food, and
no resource but the casual ward at the end of a weary
day. But the people who engage the sandwich-board
men are particularly keen men of business. They
know that in wet weather, or when snow and sleet is
falling, people in the streets are not disposed to look
to the right or left, but forge on ahead, taking no note
of sandwich-boards or any other form of advertisement, however obtrusive.  And there is a reason why
they take a broad and generous view of this. Contracts are by the week or month, whereas the men
are paid by the day. A day gained is so much
saved; and it is hinted-though of course we make no
special allegation-that it need not rain very hard, or
snow very fast, to lead some agents to decide that it
is no good sending out boards. The result is that
with the severe weather of the past month, clapper-
carrying has been a more than usually precarious
existence, and there is an immense amount of distress
among these people.
  <p>It may seem to the uninitiated that these men are
few in number. But London is a large place, and
though they may be but a thin ragged line in the
chief thoroughfares, and occasional units elsewhere,
they make up a total that, without consideration,
may appear beyond belief. We have made careful





<pb n=32>




inquiries, and find that those who depend upon
clapper-carrying for a living all the year round are
not fewer than 3,000 in number. In the winter time,
when there is a greater demand for their services
owing to the pantomimes and theatres, the number is
swelled to between six and seven thousand, the extra
contingent being provided by those who have spent
their summer months in agricultural pursuits, and,
having wound up with hop-picking, return to spend
the winter in town. But it must not be supposed
that all these men are in constant employment.
Apart from the question of the weather, the clapper-
carrier, like everyone who seeks to earn a living, has
to contend with competition. The <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">profession</q> is
overstocked. The number who can don the boards
at one time rarely exceeds half of the candidates for
employment. While at the best it is a poor business,
the pay at most places being only 1s 2d and 1s. 4d.
per day of 8 or 9 hours, at the worst it is scarcely a
means of existence at all, and many have nothing to
fall back upon but the cold charity of the casual ward.
It is so poor a calling, in fact, that the ordinary
Londen loafer and professional out-of-work looks
down upon it with scorn and contempt.     The
pensioner from the Army, who has learned no trade,
and has no other calling in life, and those who have
been brought to poverty by drink, have it all to themselves. The pensioners may be said to be the upper-
class of the profession. They have their pension of
6d. a day to fall back upon. In hard times they can
raise money on their pension tickets; it is an illegal
but a common practice. At the end of the quarter
they live riotously on the bulk of the pension, leaving










<pb n=33>



the boards to the lower grade. It is this lower
grade whose condition is so deplorable. They have
sunk so low, their clothes are so shabby, and they
have so little to recommend them to employers of
labour; too proud to beg, too honest to steal, dreading the casual ward and its contamination, though not
loathing the dirt and squalor of the lodging-house,
they are often in bitter need of the help they rarely
solicit. Among these social wrecks at the present
moment are men who have once been in good
position, if not in affluence. There are at least two
clergymen, one of whom is frequently to be seen in
the Strand. Another Strand man was once a bank
manager in India, with a salary of &pound;800 a year, Yet
another instance is that of a once well-known police
inspector, who was turned out of the force for habitual
drunkenness, after having been reduced, grade by
grade, to that of a constable. Broken down medical
men, journalists, barristers, educated men of almost
every profession are to be found in the ranks-men
who are helpless, and whose case is hopeless unless
some helping hand is held out to them.
  <p>The story of the lives of some of these men must
be full of pathos, if not of romance. The story of the
calling itself has yet to be written.  No one has ever-
thought it worth while to plumb the depths of clapper-
carrying.  And yet it is not devoid of humour.  It
has its trickeries, as every trade and profession has,
and it has many curious amenities that would repay
investigation. There is scope for talent, and an open-
ing for ingenuity even on this lowest rung of the
social ladder. It even has its middle-men ; so true is
it in life that to every depth there is a lower deep.





<pb n=34>



The middleman is he who knows all the wrinkles of
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">get-up,</q> as they call it. He knows the different
agents and the style of men they want; a plausible
fellow, too, with a knack of getting into the good
graces of everybody.  He has his following of the
less favoured and the less enterprising.  Going to an
agent's, he gets his boards, and, trotting off round the
corner, hands them over to one of his underlings for a
commission of twopence or threepence. In that way
he manages to get a living without work. Or he may
be more unscrupulous, and, having got boards at one
place, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">puts them to sleep</q> for the day, and gets a
second lot at a different place, getting paid at
both places.  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Putting to sleep</q> is the trade
euphemism for hiding the boards away, generally in
some court or at one of the well-known <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">stopping
places.</q> These stopping places are where the men
congregate when shirking their work. Usually they
are watched by a man termed a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bogey,</q> but there
are certain plausible excuses which never fail, and the
stopping places are always well patronised. The
watching at best is very inefficiently done. When the
men go out in small battalions they are in charge of a
leader, who is supposed to keep them together, but
there is generally an understood arrangement by
which the men are off in turn. One of these stopping
places is in Oxford Street just behind the Horse Shoe
Brewery. The Strand stopping-place is down an
entry near Charing Cross Station; that for Piccadilly
is in Vine Street behind the St. James's Hotel. Another
is at Ham Yard, Soho, and there is a popular one at
the Grosvenor Mews.  Every district, in fact, has its
stopping-place.




<pb n=35>

  <p>The fact of the existence of the middleman and his
dependents serves to emphasise the straits of the
poorer and less self-helpful among these men who
form a very large proportion of the total number.
These straits just now are exceptionally severe,
and though this to a large extent is due to their own
folly, the closer the acquaintance with them the more
it is seen that they are not unworthy of sympathy and
succour.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=7>
<HEAD>The Gagger and his Ways.</HEAD>

  <p>Attention has often been called to the abuse of
relief tickets, which are often distributed without
much discrimination.  It may not be generally
known that there is in London a class of persons who
gain a living by collecting free tickets either for bed
or board, and taking them to the common lodging-
houses, where they are put up to auction. The men
are known as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Gaggers</q>-a term  adapted from  a
slang expression of the stage, and indicating readiness
of speech. Plausible individuals they are, at the top
of the tree of those who cultivate the field of human
sympathy. It is not everyone who can become a
successful <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger.</q>  He must not only be ready
with his tale of woe, and be able to read the character
of those to whom he applies, but he must have an extensive acquaintance with charitable institutions, and
charitable people, for he must get his tickets readily,
or the business would be but a poor one.  He must
also be known at the lodging-houses he frequents
and have a character for selling genuine articles, or
his patrons, who are always shy of paying for anything, would not part with their coppers in exchange
for his <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">paper.</q> Glib of speech and with much
readiness of resource, the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> is able to get a
comfortable living without much display of energy.
  <p>To attend one of their auctions is to witness a
curious sight.  But before proceeding to mention a








<pb n=37>



recent experience in this direction, a few words may
be said as to the kind of ticket most largely dealt in.
Any kind of ticket is, of course, a negotiable security.
There are many hucksters' shops, where tickets for
bread and soup, or meat and coals, may be traded
and exchanged; and there are low-class public
houses where they are taken in payment for drink.
But this does not refer to the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger.</q>  What he
likes best are institutions where tickets are given for
7, 14, or 21 days' board and lodging. This is much
higher game than the soup ticket, and requiries more
skill to get, but then the result is much more profitable.  There is an institution of this class in
Providence Row, which is down Artillery Lane,
Whitechapel; one in Field Lane, Theobald's Road;
another in Ham Yard, Soho, and many others in
various parts of the metropolis.  Their object is to
provide for the real unemployed, and the tickets are
readily saleable in the lodging-houses to those who
have not acquired the knack of getting them for themselves. The <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> gets his ticket, and has to spend
one night in the institution as a sort of guarantee of
good faith, but when he leaves in the morning it is
with the intention not to return. He immediately
makes for the kitchen of a common lodging-house
where he is known, to dispose of the ticket and any
others he may have picked up of inferior quality.
  <p>The early morning assemblage in the kitchen of a
common lodging-house-more generally known as a
fourpenny doss-is an exceedingly curious one. The
dosser of either sex is not a particularly attractive
creature, and the personal characteristics of either are
more often repellent than otherwise. There is always





<pb n=38>







one way in which you can tell the habitual dosser,
whether he is a professional out o' work, a street
lounger, or a sandwich-board man. He is never without his <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">drum.</q> The drum, it may be explained, is a
tin of any kind, more often than not an Australian
meat tin, or a coffee canister picked out of the dust
boxes, which are every morning put out on the kerbstones in the central thoroughfares.  The habitual
dosser no sooner makes his appearance in the kitchen
than he takes his <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">drum</q> from a large pocket-called
a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">scran</q> pocket-constructed inside his coat to carry
it, and going up to the kitchen-man, begs some hot water
to make a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bull.</q>  This a very simple operation, and
consists in pouring the hot water on to a lot of used
tea leaves, which he has picked up or begged at a
restaurant. Whether or not it is a cup that cheers, it
certainly does not inebriate, but is wet and warm, and,
with some odd food from the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">scran</q> pocket, which
also contains a knife and fork, he proceeds with his
breakfast.
   It is in these places and among these people that
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> plies his curious calling.  If you are
lucky you have not to wait long before you see
walk into the kitchen a man whom you tell at
once is somewhat different to the rest. He is a trifle
better dressed, though not much; and a little less
seedy of aspect; but it is his general air of shrewdness
which lifts him above his fellows.  He soon gets to
business. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">How much for six nights in Providence?</q>
or twenty nights somewhere else, and he waves a
ticket in his hand.  If there is no immediate bid he
dilates on the attractiveness of the place- the snugness of the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">doss</q> and the nature of the food.  The





<pb n=39>
latter varies at the different places; at some it is only
bread and water in the morning, and at others it includes a fair day's provision.
Invariably there commences a haggle, with much use of slang words and a
plentiful sprinkling of strong expletives.  But the
tickets have a recognised market value, according to
the number of days they have run, and eventually a
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">deal</q> having been effected, the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> leaves for
the nearest public-house, before going in quest of
more tickets.
  <p>The point is that the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> is always able to
get these tickets, and having remained one night in
the institution can sell them  for sums varying from
6d. to as much as half-a-crown, sometines a little
more when it is for three weeks lodging with food;
and no one seems to notice the change in the
individual after the first night.  The explanation is
that care is taken in the giving of tickets, and a certain
amount of scrutiny exercised ; but once in the place
it is a kind of liberty hall, with compartaively little
supervision, and with a constantly changing population, numbering sometimes three or four score a
change of faces is not noticed.  However that may
be, the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> is an undoubted entity, and occupies
an acknowledged position in the ranks of professional
mendicancy. How many men there are of this class
in London it would be difficult to say, but relief
institutions are so numerous, and the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> so
artful that he is able often to ply his trade without
being found out. When found out it is only necessary
for him to change his quarters for a time, and work
another district. What is his great safeguard is that
there is little or no intercommunication between relief
agencies, and no such thing as a black list.






<pb n=40>







  <p>It would not be difficult, with a little combination,
to put an end to the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger's</q> calling, but no one
has thought it worth while to do so.  Inquiries at
various relief agencies show that his existence is well
known, and that while some do their best to keep
him out of their institutions, others do not take any
special trouble in the matter.  To do so it would be
necessary to employ some officer at a considerable
expense.  At the same time it is always to be taken
for granted that a certain portion of the relief granted
by charitable institutions goes to support undeserving
people; and some question whether it is not wiser to
spend the bulk of their money on relief, with a
certainty that some may get it who do not deserve help,
than to go to much expense to inquire into the bonafides of each applicant, with the equal certainty that
in that case many deserving people would suffer.
For it is always the case that the deserving resist
inquiry, whereas the undeserving have ever a plausible
tale, and are never at a loss for artistic detail to give
it added veri-similitude. So the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">gagger</q> flourishes,
and will doubtless continue to do so.

<HEAD>The "Dosser" at Home.</HEAD>


  <p>The <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">dosser</q> was never so much an object of
interest as he is now. Before the Salvation Army
brought the submerged tenth to the surface to appeal
to the feelings of the charitable as old-time beggars
used to reveal their deformities at the street corners,
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">dosser</q> was a person of no importance at all.
He had no recognised part in the social economy of
our large towns, but wandered abroad from two-penny
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">rope</q> to three-penny <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">doss,</q> or a night in the open,
as funds allowed. That he is a popular personage
now, who can doubt? Is he not the trump card of
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Army,</q>; and has not the London County Council taken him in hand by erecting a huge common
lodging-house in Parker Street? If you want to see
him in his infinite variety it is at Parker Street you
will find him; and just now the occupants run the full
gamut of social position, from a real lord to the lowest
in the social scale.
  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It is not often that the nobility patronise our
establishment,</q> said the manager, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">but it has that distinction just now, and is rather proud of it, I can tell
you. No, it is not the Viscount you mention, and who
is by this time pretty familiar to Londoners; but
another who curiously enough follows the same calling. No,</q> in reply to another
question, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">he does not
perambulate the London streets. He goes to Brighton
from Saturday to Tuesday every week, and earns






<pb n=42>







enough to live on for the rest of the week. It's a
showy affair he has, drawn by four ponies; but he
does not bring it here.</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">And he lives here the other half of the week?</q>
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Yes, and makes himself quite at home. He is hail
fellow well met with everyone, puts on no airs, sleeps
in the common dormitory like the most commonplace
of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">dossers,</q> pays his fivepence every day, has his own
food in, and cooks it, too.</q>
  <p>The cooking of one's own food, it appears, is one of
the features of the institution. We walk into the
kitchen, which, like everything else about the place, is
on a huge scale. There are some men cooking, some
eating, some unwrapping their purchases. The kitchen
is redolent of onions, intermingled with a strong scent
of kippers, of which succulent dainty a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">dosser</q> is
grilling a couple over the ample stove. Around the
stove are rows upon rows of saucepans and other
utensils scoured to their brightest capacity. The
County Council provides these, an attendant keeps
them clean, and the lodger has the use of anything he
may want free of charge, the fivepence a night being
entirely inclusive. Everything is clean and tidy, and
we can even imagine a real lord, down on his luck,
not disdaining to use it. The advantage of the Parker
street establishment, from the sight-seeing point of
view, is that its frequenters are of all classes. In the
ordinary common lodging-house you have gradations
of poverty, to every depth a lower deep, but always
carefully assorted into classes affecting different lodgings, with much caste prejudice one against the other.
There is a good deal of exclusiveness among the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">higher grades</q> at Parker Street, but the living rooms








<pb n=43>



are used in common, and there is no prescriptive
right to the first turn at the kitchen fire than the
usual rule of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">first come, first served.</q> You can tell
at once the working man who is a dosser by compulsion and hopes that it will only be temporary. He
has not yet come to his bottom dollar; and his comb
and brush and small stock of clean collars are objects
of curiosity to his companions.  He is indeed a
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">swell</q> who happens to possess a looking-glass;
while if he produces a razor and begins to shave himself over the common sink, he takes rank at once
among the millionaires of the establishment. The true
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">dosser</q> is here, and soon attracts notice. He rather
grumbles at fivepence a night. having never before
paid more than fourpence. He objects to the kitchen
being closed each day from ten until noon for cleaning
purposes, because, not being by nature an early riser,
he has either to get up and have his breakfast before
ten or wait until the more aristocratic hour of noon.
It is not that he does not like to lie in bed all the
morning, but that he objects to hard and fast rules
about anything. Why the kitchen should want cleaning every day is a matter beyond his comprehension;
and when the time comes for the day room to be
turned out, that is an outrage beyond all bearing, and
he promenades the passage muttering curses loud
and deep.
  <p>Then, of course, there is the gentleman who has
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">done his time,</q> and who, when he has finished his
meals, will regale those around him with stories of his
past exploits and his experiences in <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the stone jug.</q>
It is a curious feature about him that he always extols
the way things used to be, and the decadence of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">art</q>






<pb n=44>
among the light-fingered ones of the present day. He
is not above practising a little at the expense of new-
comers, who, if they leave anything on the table while
they go into the passage to buy anything at the little
shop there, will be sure to find it missing when they
return.  There used to be a good deal of petty
thieving when the municipal lodging house was
opened. If a man, having cooked his dinner, left
it on the table while he went out to borrow some salt
or buy some bread, his dinner would certainly have
disappeared. This is by no means unknown now,
but has been brought to the irreducible minimum.
As the manager got to know his customers, those of
a doubtful character were eliminated.  There are
now always sixty or seventy men turned away every
day for want of room, and an effort is made, with more
or less success, to eliminate the disreputable and
encourage the really deserving. Still, for ways that
are dark and for tricks that are not always vain the
dosser rivals the heathen Chinee; and the manager has
enough to do sometimes to maintain proper decorum,
and to see that the weak and helpless are not imposed
on or robbed.
   <p>Something of the kind has just taken place. A
 sallow-faced, down-at-heel foreigner is making a complaint in broken English,
 which seems wholly unintelligible, but which the attendant comprehends at
 once. The foreigner, fresh to the establishment and
 its ways, had been cooking his dinner, and, leaving it
 a moment on the fire, returned to find it gone. The
 attendant goes into the kitchen to inquire ; but not a
 trace is left, and the only consolation for the complainant is that he must not on any account leave
 anything about.








<pb n=45>



  <p>The impression one gets from a visit to the municipal lodging-house and a chat with the officials is
that the place is a boon for working men in temporary
straits, but that much must not be expected from it
in the way of elevating the real dossers; the men who
have no ambition in life but to live as lazily as possible,
and to get as much for nothing as is to be obtained.
While the former are thankful to have such a place to
fall back on, the latter are full of complaints of a
trivial character. They chafe under the restraints and
rules necessary in a large establishment under public
control. They miss the freedom, the dirt, the frowsy
companionship of the common lodging-house, Having
looked around at the bright and cleanly kitchen, the
attractive day-room with its library, newspapers and
easy benches, on which some half-dozen were indulging
in siestas, and the airy and wonderfully tidy dormitories, with each bed enclosed to a height of seven or
eight feet, making so many rows of miniature bedrooms, open at the top for ventilation, it was difficult
to imagine that there could be any grievance. But
some, on being spoken to, were very ready with complaints. One was that no hot
water could be got before 8 a.m. or after 4.30 p.m., <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">so that a man who had
been out all day, and wanted to wash his clothes when
he came home, could not do so.</q> It was a curious
complaint, but it was made in all seriousness. Other
complaints were much of the same nature, forming a
striking contrast to the statement of one respectable
looking man, who was dining off bread and cheese
with great heartiness, that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the place had all the
advantages a working man with no home could desire;
and that it was a great blessing to those who had
hitherto been driven to the dens around.</q>

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=9>

<HEAD>The Professional <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Bailer-Out.</q></HEAD>



  <p>One of the most curious methods of earning a
livelihood is that of the professsional <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bailer-out.</q>
He is one of the common objects of the police-station
rather than the police-court, for his business does not
embrace the criminal or misdemeanant who, after a
preliminary appearance before one of the police
magistrates, is allowed out on bail. He confines his
attentions to the drunk and disorderly, who, after a
short spell of the sobering influence of the police-cell,
is allowed to go home on finding a surety for his
appearance on the following morning. Not liking to
trouble his own friends, he is glad to avail himself of
the services of one who, for a consideration that varies
according to the social status of the bailed one, agrees
to forfeit to Her Sovereign Majesty the Queen the
sum of anything, from &pound;2 to &pound;50, if the defendant
does not duly appear at 10 o'clock on the morrow
before one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace,
then and there to take his trial; the same to be
levied on his goods and chattles, lands and tenements. In this form, with a little more legal verbiage,
the professional bailer-out risks his wordly goods,
three or four or perhaps half-a-dozen times a night,
for a remuneration that is never less than half-a-
crown and rarely more than half a sovereign. And it
has not to be done in any secret or underhand way.
The bailer-out, generally known as Tommy or










<pb n=47>



Johnny, is a recognised institution at the police-
station of the metropolis. A friendly policeman will
give you his address openly and readily, as a matter
of ordinary routine. On first thought it seems not a
little singular that such a system should exist; but a
police-inspector frankly declared that it is really no
business of the police who bails a man out. The law
allows a man to find a surety, and it does not matter
to the law whether it is the defendant's own friend or
a person who does it for gain, so long as the bailer is
good for the amount of his recognizances.
  <p>With a view to having a chat with one of these men
I found myself one night in the neighbourhood of one
of the West-end courts, where the system is naturally
most in use. Feeling that, though the system might
be winked at by the police, it might not be openly
avowed, I entered the gloomy portals of the station
with some trepidation. My entrance was at once
barred by the doorkeeper, who demanded my
business.
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Is Johnny about?</q>-this quite as a venture.
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">What Johnny-don't know no Johnnies here.
Who d'yer want?</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Oh, yes you do; Johnny the man that bails
people out.</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">You mean Tommy.</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Oh, yes-Tommy-I had forgotten his name.</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">No, he is not about now. He was here half an
hour ago about a woman.</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Can you give me his address?</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">No, I don't know his address: but you will find
him at the Rising Sun.</q>







<pb n=48>







  <p>At this moment another policeman comes to the
door and inquires, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">You want the bailer-out.</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Yes,
can you give me his address?</q> The address is given
at a street in the neighbourhood, with the added
injunction, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">When you have done your own little
business, you might tell him to come round here;
there's a lady wants him; same one as he saw before;
it's a little way up the street, on the left-hand side,
and you will find his name on a brass plate on the
door.</q>
  <p>The street proves to be a busy thoroughfare, largely
occupied by dealers in the antique. The door, on
the post of which is the name of the man we are
seeking, is so sandwiched between two big shop windows that it can hardly be seen. A woman is at the
door with an apron over her head, talking to-another
very stylish-dressed, who seems in some trouble.
Asked if Mr Blank is in, the woman of the house
replies that he is not, and she does not know where
he is.
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Do you want to have someone bailed out?</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Yes</q>-boldly, but with a blush.
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">And so does this lady; he is sure to be back just
now.</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Is he at the bottom?</q>-pointing to the public-
house.
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">No, but he may be at the cafe having his dinner.</q>
The bailer-out keeps quality hours and dines late.
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">If you don't find him there, come back, and if he
comes I'll tell him.</q>
  <p>We go down to the cafe-a rather swell place.
Evidently bailing-out is a good business. There Mr.









<pb n=49>



Blank is, on the point of finishing a good repast, He
receives the message, and says he will look round just
now, when he has had a cigar. This suggests an
adjournment to the smoke-room, where cigars and
drinks are forthcoming. Meantime I note that the
bailer-out seems quite a man-about-town; dapper,
well-dressed, with carefully brused hair, curled moustache, and a general appearance of gentlemanliness-
a striking contrast to the hanger-on and street
lounger one might have expected to see. But he is
strangely reticent when we begin to talk. No, he
does not think it a curious business; why should he?
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">What is there curious about it?</q>  He has lived
there twenty-two years, and is well-known as a man
of substance. Why is it strange that when anyone
is in trouble they should send to him to bail them
out? <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Not strange at all, of course, if they are all
friends.</q> He winks, and looks amused. But this
assumption of universal friendship soon breaks down.
He admits that he is no philanthropist. One cannot
be called up at all hours of the night without some
recompense. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">But it is a risky business,</q> he adds
and makes a poor attempt to look as though it was
so unprofitable that he was really considering whether
it would not be wiser to throw it up altogether.
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Why, what risk is there?</q>
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Well, you know, I have to pay up sometimes, and
then it takes the gilt off the gingerbread. I had to
pay &pound;50 once. That was some years ago. A month
ago I had to pay &pound;20. It's a risky business.</q> And
he shakes his head dolefully.
  <p>At this moment a woman interrupts. It is the
one who was at the door, and who has followed on.





<pb n=50>







It seems that Mr Somebody has been run in again at
Bow-street. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Too early for Bow-street,</q> says our
man, taking out a fine gold watch and looking at the
time.  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">What has he been doing this time?</q>
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Interfering with the police.</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Well, I'll go round
just now. He has given the same name, I suppose?</q>
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Yes, the same name.</q> And she goes away. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">He
is always in trouble. I have fetched him out five
times this year myself,</q> the bailer-out remarks in a
confidential whisper, as the woman goes tearfully
downstairs.
  <p>We go on talking again, but the bailer-out does not
wax confidential. His manner seems to denote that
he has got a snug thing, but is wary of interlopers,
and does not want to give himself away. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It's a
risky business-a risky business,</q> he remarks, as
though there were more chance of loss than gain
attaching to it. But, for a man engaged in a risky
business, he has every appearance of thriving upon it
remarkably well. We try to draw him out as to
whether he has met with any queer customers, or had
any experiences of a curious character, but he
declares that it is all very prosaic. He does not
trouble himself about his customers, so long as he
obtains their honorarium, and they turn up in the
morning. Often they give a false name, and perhaps
he never sees them again. But if he has ever done
so, and if he has any secrets in his profession, he
showed that he could keep them, and was not at all
disposed to be garrulous to a chance acquaintance.
And so we leave him still muttering, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It's a poor
business-a risky business. I had to pay &pound;50 once.</q>

<HEAD>A Curious Harvest.</HEAD>



  <p>It has been remarked, somewhat in a spirit of
reproach, that one half the world does not know how
the other half lives. But in some instances it is not
altogether surprising. Take the case of the <foreign lang=fr>chiffonnier</foreign>
-those uncouth and mostly unkempt pickers-up of
unconsidered trifles who hover about the streets in
early morning looking very much like human carrion,
as, regardless of passers-by and unheeded by the
police, they dive into the dust buckets and boxes put
out upon the edge of the pavement each morning to
await the arrival of the dust cart. How are those who
follow the example of Sydney Smith of never getting
up until the world is properly aired, to know much of
the life history of those who follow this humble walk
in life? For they are essentially early birds. Their
field of labour disappears, by stern edict of the
authorities, before the time the average City merchant
goes to his office, and before the West-end awakes to
the consciousness that another day has dawned. And
yet there is much to interest the curious in connection
with them. They are not particularly picturesque in
their appearance; and their occupation is one that is
rather repellent than otherwise on a merely casual
acquaintance; but it is interesting to see that even
the most worthless articles have some commercial
value, and to fathom the process by which the house

<pb n=52>







and shop refuse doomed to the dust-cart furnishes a
livelihood to some hundreds of human beings with no
other source of income.
  <p>Not that it is an easy matter to get at the facts.
These early birds are very shy. They have an inborn
suspicion of anyone who <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">wants to know,</q> and,
possessing little faith in disinterested curiosity, are
apt to resent impertinent inquiry as to their vocation.
On the other hand, it is absolutely useless to think of
forming by watching them any reliable conclusion as
to why they reject one thing and throw another into
the bag they carry over their shoulders. To the uninitiated the one seems as worthless as the other,and it
is a matter of curiosity where they got that training
of eye and hand necessary for their occupation. But
a little observation reveals one or two points. The
first thing the student of their ways and means
realises is that these people have their regular walks,
which are recognised by their fellows in the business.
Whether they were obtained by original discovery or
forcible invasion is not apparent. But the prescriptive right is recognised in the main, and though a
couple may occasionally be seen squabbling over a
particularly promising bucketful, pitched battles on
these miniature dust heaps are the exception and not
the rule. In some cases, no doubt the right has
been obtained by inheritance, for another noticeable
fact is that family arrangements are very general.
Daughters and sons are born into the profession, and
take to it kindly. The most expert pickers are young
boys and girls, youths and young women. Some have
a perfect genius for their calling, and the idle man
may find much diversion in watching the skill




<pb n=53>



with which these youthful adepts will turn over the
contents of a big box or bucket, and extract the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">valuables</q> with the keen zest and nice discrimination of the connoisseur. They are more approachable,
too, age not having brought to them that general distrust of the stranger which characterises their elders.
  <p>One of these gave his story as follows:-Father, an
unique specimen of the London loafer, with an
acquaintance with the interior of Her Majesty's
prisons. Mother, a hard-working woman as a rule,
but with a taste for gin and conversation not altogether
to the advantage of the young family. Two sons and
two daughters; the two eldest serving an apprentice
to the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">profession,</q> and the youngest minding each
other as best they can. Home, a squalid room in the
neighbourhood of Clare Market, where the stock-in-
trade is prepared for disposal to the merchants. Their
combined efforts resulted in a fairly good income;
aided by odd jobs in the market on the part of the
father, a little-very little sometimes-charing on the
part of the mother, and begging and errands on the
part of the youngsters.
  <p>The <foreign lang=la>modus operandi</foreign> has no superabundance of
details. It has not been elevated into a fine art here
as in Paris, and many articles which would be a
source of comparative wealth to the Parisian are left
untouched.  But still there is a certain amount of
variety.  Foremost among the castaway valuables is
ranked the sardine tin, and the tins that have contained meat, fish, and fruit.  This is pre-eminently
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">can</q> season, and almost every receptable which
decorates the kerbstones in the morning contains one
or more. Uninviting-looking articles many of them


<pb n=54>







are; but no matter what their condition, they are
pounced upon with glee and thrust into the bags as
precious relics. At home they are <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">prepared for the
market</q> by being battered into the smallest possible
compass, and in that condition they are sold to
dealers, who give as much as a penny for ten pounds
weight. The dealer sells them at a considerable
profit, and their destination is the melting pot for the
extraction and utilisation of the solder.
  <p>Bits of glass are not despised; window glass being
the most valuable.  These are picked out and kept
until there is a fairly large amount. Then the bulk is
sold to a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">middleman,</q> who will give sixpence or a
shilling for a fair-sized bag-ful; and he gets a fair
profit by carting it to the glass works in the neighbourhood of Greenwich, where it is boiled down and
converted into brand-new glass. Paper or cardboard
result in profit in the same way, and is a much more
marketable  commodity.  It is sold at a very
remunerative price for cartage to the paper-mills,
where it is boiled down and reconverted into paper.
The refuse daily swept out of drapers' shops is quite
a prize, and is swooped down upon with eagerness,
because there is generally not only a large amount of
clean paper and cardboard, but large pieces of wood
which in their turn come in use for fuel.
  <p>One does not realise the variety of articles which
are rescued from the dust cart by these people until
a visit has been paid to the home of one of them. In
the middle of the room will be the result of the mornings pickings, forming an uninviting heap, and all
around are piles of the prepared article. Here a pile
of bones, there a heap of rags. In one corner quite a









<pb n=55>



nest of bottles, rescued intact, and destined when
cleaned to find their way once more into the chemist's
or publican's, according to their shape. In another
place pieces of leather, cleaned and dried. These, it
seems, are largely used in repairing by the low-class
cobblers who do cheap work. The rags are specially
cleaned  and  sorted into <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">linen,</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">white,</q> and
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">coloured,</q> there being a special price for each kind.
Much of this uninviting stuff, it appears, is made into
lint, when properly cleaned and prepared, and the
rest goes to the paper mills. Pieces of iron, old nails,
and metallic odds and ends will occupy a separate
corner, and too have have in the aggregate a surprising value.
  <p>Again, he is unlucky who does not get more
valuable prizes, such as a cast-off pair of shoes, a discarded lock, which a little ingenuity can mend, a
screwdriver, gimlet, or pair of sissors which a servant
girl has carelessly thrown away. These, cleaned up,
are bought by the costermongers, who may be seen
in any of the principal thoroughfares almost every
night with   barrows containing  curious  assortments of such ironmongery.     And so, with   a
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bit of luck,</q> and a commendable amount of industry, these  people  go  on  from  month   to
month, and from year to year, picking up a livlihood that would be naturally classified as precarious,
but which, in point of fact, is not precarious at all,
because the field is always open, and the pickings and
the profits sure.

<HEAD>Poverty Corner.</HEAD>



  <p>This is not a name to be found in Bradshaw, nor
yet in the Post Office Directory.  It is not painted
on the lamp-post against which so many coat shoulders
have been rubbed theadbare in hours of meditative
lounging, nor is it writ large on the gable of the
corner hostelry that he who runs may read. Yet it is
a well known corner in London, and one that, in the
opinion of its many frequenters, is aptly named.
What dead and gone cynic christened it no one now
remembers; but the name has still clung to it, and
may be heard applied to it many times on any day in
accents of despair, of bitter disappointment, of laughing heedlessness, or of heartfelt pity. For Poverty
Corner has a history of its own, and has marked the
turning point-ever for the worse-in the lives of so
many that instinctively one looks up at the wall half
expectant to see, pointing downhill, one of these big
hands peculiar to sign-posts, with thumb curiously
foreshortened  and  forefinger unduly  elongated,
attached to the old legend  beginning  <q lang=la>Facilis
descensus.</q>
  <p>But though Poverty Corner is well known, it is
mainly well known to one class; and it may be necessary to locate it more exactly for the benefit of the
uninitiated. It is the corner of York-road and
Waterloo-road just over the water on the Surrey side,
on the same side of the way as the York Hotel, with










<pb n=57>



its many entrances, and its ever-opening doors. Here
from morning to night its frequenters are to be seen-
a motley crowd for the most part, with a more or less
out-of-elbows appearance. What there is of showiness is almost exclusively confined to the women, and
there are many of these. The paint and powder, the
loud costumes, the conversation that smacks of the
footlights and the green-room, proclaim the calling of
them all. They are the followers of the profession,
those who have missed their grasp at the topmost
rung of the music-hall ladder, or failed to hold it
when they had it in their hands, and who are now
slipping downwards, step by step. It is at once the
outdoor club, the market-place, and perpetual hiring
fair of the second-rate. The youthful artist, with
ambitions newly kindled, and hopes as yet undimmed,
avoids the place. The <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">star</q> still shining in the
high firmament of prosperity disdains to illumine the
shady corner even with an occasional presence. The
draught-board suits of the men have seen better days;
the showy finery of many of the women looks garish
and often tawdry in the sunshine. It is not the rich
and the prosperous, but the struggling, the mediocre,
and the unsuccessful who jostle against each other at
Poverty Corner-some of them heedlessly rushing
headlong downhill, but others struggling manfully
against a perverse fate.
  <p>It has been ever thus time out of mind. Actuated
by that instinct which in all large towns has caused
men of distinct trades and professions to gather
together in a special vicinity, the music-hall agent, in
all varieties of the species, settled down in Stamford-
street and York-road. The music-hall artist out of






<pb n=58>






employment has only his agent to look to, and, calling
to see him, not unnaturally falls into the habit of
stopping to have a chat with those similarly situated.
The crowd has got bigger as the years have rolled
on; and the waiting has become more inevitable and
persistent as the competition has increased. That is
the chief change, except that the number of those
still seeking to drown their cares in drink having proportionately increased, it was found necessary a few
years ago to enlarge the accommodation of the York
Tavern. Now, a big display of obtrusive gilt, mahogony, and elaborately chased plate glass forms the
back-ground to the ever-changing groupings upon the
footpath.
  <p>There is a good deal of bustle and activity, too.
Gossip is continual, and the latest bit of scandal or
tit-bit from before the footlights is buzzed from mouth
to mouth. There is much running backwards and
forwards between agents' offices,  Sometimes a
messenger, out of breath, rushes up, and, dodging
among the the crowd, gives a hurried whisper to a
waiting one, who immediately becomes as keenly
active as the messenger himself. In a few minutes,
perhaps, the man who had been fetched will come
back with his agent, and a personage who excites
universal respect. He is a manager, who has had a
gap to fill up in the programme, and over a friendly
drink in a snug room leading out of the saloon an
agreement is ratified. For business is often done at
Poverty Corner. It is no infrequent thing for a man
to be standing on the kerbstone one moment in the
depth of despair and to find himself hurried off to the
Continent, or some out of the way English music-











<pb n=59>



hall, the next, without any time allowed for packing
his wardrobe. Ladies, however, are principally preferred for Continental engagments, and among the
crowd may always be seen one or more either going
or <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">settling to go</q> to France or Germany to sing at
a <foreign lang=fr>cafe chantant</foreign>. In the meantime they wander from
the bar to the kerb-stone, waiting for something to
turn up, and idling away the time as best they can.
The passer-by notices that there is a good deal of
cliqueism among them. The <foreign lang=fr>habitues</foreign> of the saloon
and private bars, where <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">parlour prices are charged</q>
and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">malt liquor only served in glasses,</q> have little
to say to the frequenters of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the public bar</q> and
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">jug and bottle department</q>-which, by the way,
jugs and bottles always avoid-where four-half is consumed in pewter tankards. Concert-hall singers are
not more unsympathetic than other people, but
naturally the man who is out of collar himself has
not much inclination to give to those who, having
once been shining lights, have, through drink and
improvidence, become mere wrecks of humanity.
Several there are who will be pointed out to the
curious visitor as so-and-so, who used to get &pound;10,
&pound;20, and &pound;40 a week each, who kept their broughams
and changed their dresses in them as they were driven
from hall to hall, and who squandered splendid
incomes recklessly.
  <p>But all is not gold that glitters, and it is well to
remember that the big salaries paid are not all profit.
The expenses are large-so large that the second-rate
man has not much margin for extravagance. Then,
with, of course, many exceptions, there are intervals
more or less long of non-employment. And, above






<pb n=60>







all, the constant deduction of 10 per cent. for the
agent. The man who grows fat upon the music-hall
business is the agent. His is all profit and no risk.
Bad business does not affect him as it does the
manager, and his expenses are next to nothing. A
large proportion of his customers are sure to be
always in employment, and he gets 10 per cent. on all
they earn. They cannot avoid the tax, for they
cannot get employed except through him. Of all the
middlemen who have grown up in the country, none
have such a snug and satisfactory position as he. The
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">star</q> can stay at home and get his letters by post.
He has to pay the percentage just the same, but he
need not walk to his agent's every morning, and
linger round Poverty Corner, to be on the spot in case
of inquiries. The smaller men, who begin and end
performances, when the hall is half filled, are not in
such an independent position. It is their dependence
upon their agent which has created Poverty Corner,
and which will keep it peopled until the system is
broken through.

<HEAD>Babel on the Wool Exchange.</HEAD>



  <p>Any one who wishes to have a fair idea of what the
confusion of tongues was like may be recommended
to pass half an hour in the Wool Exchange, in the
City, during one of the periodical sales held there. It
surpasses anything in that direction within ordinary
experience. There is probably no other place in the
world where so many excited representatives of foreign
nations are congregated; certainly no place equal to it
for the extrordinary babel which prevails day after day
for the three or four weeks that each of the series of
sales last. A <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">wool sale</q> does not sound very inviting to those on the look-out for novelty and
amusement, but any one turning into the Coleman Street
establishment will find his preconceived ideas on the
subject of sales by auction rudely assailed. A wool
sale has nothing in common with the sale by auction
of any other commodity.
  <p>Coleman Street is a fairly busy street at the back
of the Bank, given over to city warehouses, and it is
not easy to find the Wool Exchange without asking
a policeman. For the Exchange is hidden away behind
the high offices on the left-hand side going from the
Bank. A short flight of steps leads up to a passage
lined with small shops, and at the end of the passage
is a flight of steps with swinging doors. There is still
nothing to indicate the Wool Exchange; but pass
through the swinging doors and your ears are at once






<pb n=62>







assailed with cacophonous sounds that startle you. At
one moment you think they are howls of execration.
Some unfortunate fellow must be being mobbed.
Then the sounds change. It is like the baying of a
pack of hounds in full cry. They die away suddenly,
only to break out with renewed vigour a moment
later. While this is going on you hurry upstairs,
eager to see what it all means. At the top of the
staircase you pass through glazed doors into a narrow
gallery, with something of the look of the whispering
gallery at St. Paul's. This is perhaps suggested by
the huge glazed dome which forms the roof. You look
down upon a strange picture. In serried rank are five
or six hundred men of all nations, acting apparently
in the most unaccountable manner. Their seats are
arranged in a semi-circle, and they are packed close
together like herrings in a cask. On a rostrum at
the side is the auctioneer; the only calm and dignified man in the place, if you except his assistant and
his clerk, who are absorbed in their ledgers. The
foreigners are all immersed in large papers, like the
agenda papers of the Common Council. Busy with
their pencils. they never look up except to bid; they
never look to one another; never exchange a word.
The all-absorbing nature of the business in hand is
the first characteristic one notices. All the rest seems
chaotic to the uninitiated. The auctioneer calls out
a number. Immediately a dozen or twenty people
get up and bay or howl at him. You recognise
the sounds which appalled you on the staircase,
but you distinguish nothing. The auctioneer is a
mild, inoffensive man, and you wonder what they
are execrating him for. He takes no notice, but









<pb n=63>



goes on writing in a book with a huge quill pen
that looks big enough to have come from the wing of
an ostrich. The cacophony continues. Every man is
excited, and howls at the top of his voice. What they
are shouting you have not the faintest idea. Two or
three are getting red in the face and look apoplectic,
All have their right hands extended, and wave their
catalogues in the face of the auctioneer. Whatever
they are howling, it is directed at him. He looks up
presently, and points his quill at one man. Several
of the others drop in their seats; but immediately
there is a fresh shout from those that remain standing.
It is a new note, but it is as yet undistinguishable.
Then the auctioneer looks up, something is said you
cannot hear, and they all drop into their seats. You
imagine that they are utterly exhausted and worn
out. In another minute they are on their feet again;
the babel is continuous. At one moment there are a
Hungarian, an Austrian, a German, a Frenchman, a
Russian, and an Italian joining in the cry. Then up
jumps a man with an unmistakeably Jewish type of
countenance. They are all animated by the same
excitement; and even the phlegmatic Englishman
shouts and bawls with the rest.
  <p>After a little watching, and a stray question put to
a neighbour-the gallery is full of people who are
probably spectators, as they take no part in the proceedings-one begins to understand the process. The
first point learned is that the number the auctioneer
calls is the number on the catalogue, and refers to so
many bales of wool, samples of which have been on
view elsewhere. There is no laudation of the wool,
no appeal for bids, no opportunity for the auctioneer






<pb n=64>







to be smart or jocose. The number is no sooner
called than someone shouts ten or twelve, or any
number up to eighteen. Then the babel begins. The
first shout you find to be one. Everybody ispointing
at the auctioneer, and furiously shouting <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">one.</q> The
sound which is so much like the baying of a pack of
hounds is distinguished to be <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">half</q>; and the next
is found to be <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">three.</q> A neighbour explains that
the wool is sold by the pound, and fetches from 8d.
to eighteen-pence per pound. If the figure <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">8</q> is
shouted, the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">one</q> means eightpence-farthing, the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">half</q> means eightpence-halfpenny, and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">three</q>
means eightpence three-farthings. The lot is supposed
to be knocked down to the one who first bids the
highest amount; but how the auctioneer distinguishes
him in such a babel of sound, it is difficult to see. If
eightpence is bid, and some one gives <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">half</q> more,
then all the bidders go on shouting <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">half, half,</q> without stopping, until someone bids again, or until the
auctioneer points to the one to whom it is knocked
down. Even then the bidder may not get the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">lot,</q>
for if the previous buyer got his lot at the same price
he can calmly say <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">last buyer,</q> though he has not
bid at all, he having the option of taking the next lot
if the price is the same. This often occurs, but the
bidder thus baulked of his purchase takes his defeat
philosophically. And this again points to a characteristic of the place. Seeing the excitement with which
the bidding goes on, one would suppose there would be
much wrangling about who really bid first, or who
should have the various lots.  But the authority of
the auctioneers appears never to be questioned.
   <p>Having shown how the sales proceed, it may be
 interesting to add a few details of the amount of wool






<pb n=65>



sold. These sales have usually been held five times
a year, but in the year (<datestruct value="1894--"><year>1894</year></datestruct>)
there were six. They
last two or three weeks; and usually the amount of
wool sold at each series of sales is of the value of from
five to six millions sterling. The largest amount
comes from Australia. Last year, of 1,410,000  bales,
1,170,000 bales came to England to be sold; this
was a decrease on the previous year owing to the
drought in Queensland and other causes. From the
Cape 274.616 bales were imported, only a very small
quantity going to the Continent and America direct.
The remainder come from the River Plate, to the extent of half a million bales; East India, 104,000 bales;
Persia, Spain, and Portugal, Russia, the Mediterranean,
Peru, and China; the last-mentioned being comparatively small quantities This year the stocks of wool
to be sold are much heavier, and will necessitate the
sixth sale. Last year there were many causes of
depression. In the first place, the American crisis
caused an almost complete cessation of demand both
for wool and woollen goods. Then the tariff war
betweeen Germany and England, which also broke
out in the summer, worked in the same direction. It
considerably hampered the German industry by closing to it an important outlet, and reduced the volume
of its competition for the raw material. While the
export demand thus became contracted, and increasing quantities of goods were thrown on the home
markets, the consuming power here was impaired by
labour disputes-notably the coal strike-and by
enormous losses in investments. This year the prospect is much more promising. It is a distinct
advantage to this country that practically all the wool of






<pb n=66>

the world should be sold here, for the profits in various
directions must be very great. The import of wool
has grown enormously. In <datestruct value="1860--"><year>1860</year></datestruct> the amount of colonial
wool imported into Europe and America, through this
country, was 226,000 bales, and the total value was
&pound;6,850,000. Last year the total value had risen to
just under 26 millions sterling ; a little more than the
year before, but a million less than <datestruct value="1891--"><year>1891</year></datestruct>, and this
though the average value per bale has decreased from
&pound;25 15s. in <datestruct value="1860--"><year>1860</year></datestruct> to &pound;12
10s. last year. All this means
work for shippers, railway companies, warehousemen,
and other distributing agencies, and employment for
auctioneers and others, forming a considerable item
in the commerce of the country. The remembrance
of these facts adds an element of interest to a visit to
the Wool Exchange, where in so curious a manner the
wool passes from the hands of the grower to the consumer.

<HEAD>A Market of Human Flesh and Blood.<note type=foot n=1>This article appeared in the <title>St. James Gazette</title> of <datestruct value="1896-09-01"><month>September</month> <day type=number>1st,</day>
   <year>1896.</year></datestruct></note></HEAD>
  <p>A little-known spot in London is at the corner of
Lexington Street and Broad Street, in the small area
to the east of Regent Street, which is densely populated
by working tailors and tailoresses.  Some unknown
cynic christened the corner <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Meat Market;</q> the
suggestion being that it is a market of human flesh
and blood, and not of butchers' meat. The name has
clung to it, just as the designation of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Poverty
Corner</q> clings to the corner of York Road and
and Waterloo Road, where in the early morning the
lower members of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo"><emph>the</emph> profession</q> foregather to
await employment.  There are some points of
resemblance between Poverty Corner and the Meat
Market, though in the main features of each there is
entire dissimilarity. They agree in the one fact that at
each the most woe-begone and down-at-heel of their
profession or trade are to be met with.  Fortune's
victims jostle against the victims of drink and their
own folly; the pinch of poverty afflicts them all;
and at each the most saddening sight is that of young
girls lounging about, waiting for something to turn
up, indulging in coarse jokes, and coarser actions.
  <p>The chief point of dissimilarity between the two
places is that at Poverty Corner the emissary of the







<pb n=68>







theatrical agent goes to the corner to find a particular
man, and there offers him terms to go off perhaps to
some foreign cafe-chantant. At the Meat Market
there is put up on the wall, just around the corner,
in Lexington-street, a large board, on which, after the
fashion of the house agents, little bits of square paper
or card are nailed up, announcing the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">wants.</q> This
board affords a curious study. Some of the wants are
printed, others written, and the caligraphy of most
betrays the foreign origin of the writer. The spelling
is often strictly on phonetic principles, and instructions
to go to the two-pair back, ring the top bell on the
right-hand side, or walk straight up to the top floor
indicate the nature of the place where the employment is to be found. A little acquaintance with these
places shows that the cynic was not far wrong in
calling the place a market of human beings. To paraphrase Tom Hood, it might truly be said
that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">it is not <emph>suits</emph> you are wearing out, but human creatures'
lives.</q>  Many of these places are what are known as
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">back shops.</q> In the lofts over stables, in overcrowded dity rooms, on every floor of buildings, large
or small, the clothes are made of dudes and mashers,
of princes, and peers, for the work done here is for
big firms in Seckville-street, Maddox-street, Hanover-
street, and elsewhere.
  <p>There are two ways in which anyone can investigate these places for himself. One is to wait at
the Lexington-street corner until some fresh <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">want</q>
is announced, and follow the rush of applicants, going
in with the crowd and looking around. The second
is to walk through any of the streets in the tailors'
area, which includes Poland-street, Portland-street




<pb n=69>

Broad-street, Lexington-street, King-street, and even
extends as far as Heddon-street. You will not have
walked far before you meet one or more girls carrying
finished or unfinished garments, roughly covered with
a piece of black linen. They are called <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">trotters,</q>
and their duty is to carry the garments to and from the
shops. By following on it can readily be seen where
the clothes are made. In a few hours' acquaintance
can be made in this way with more squalid misery
and with more loathsome filthiness than could be
found in any equal space of time in the East-end.
  <p>One of the surprises of the West-end, and
particularly of this part of it, is that, to an extent
hardly to be met with in any part of London, there
are extremes of affluence and poverty. Wedged in
between the most important shopping streets of
London are dirty courts, foul-smelling mews, obscure
lanes, squalid alleys, full of workshops, warehouses,
and tenement blocks. Many of the houses retain
somewhat of their original stateliness, especially in
long-forgotten squares where rank and beauty once
resided. Such houses emphasise the fallen condition
of the neighbourhood, which has run the entire gamut
of fortune's favours since, two centuries ago, it was
open fields, melancholy and marshy.  From   the
region of the Holy Well (now Holywell-street) the
West-end gradually extended through Covent-garden
to Soho-square, Golden-square, the Seven-dials, and
so on to Mayfair, leaving behind a track of large
houses of no great architectural beauty, surrounded
by large gardens, now built over with smaller
tenements.





<pb n=70>







  <p>It thus happens that many of these tailors' houses
have a fair exterior. But pass through the entrance
passage into the interior and they are found to be
whited sepulchres. Every room  on every floor is
filled to overflowing with both sexes. There is dirt
and disorder everywhere, and the sanitary appliances
are of the most insufficient character. These places
are let and sub-let in a remarkable manner. As a
rule they are let out in <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">sittings.</q> A bench is run all
round the room, and a sitting is about a square yard
of space at this. A man will pay half-a-crown a week
for a sitting for himself, and a shilling or eighteen-
pence a week for each member of his family, or any
one he employs; for the fact that to every depth
there is a lower deep is nowhere so true as in the
tailors' den. Included in this is facility to heat his
irons and other advantages which would cost him a
considerable outlay to procure if he wanted to work
in his own lodgings. Here they bring their work,
which they get from one of the middlemen and by
working eighteen hours a day, and Sundays included
probably, they can earn 25s. a week. In many of
these places fifty or sixty men and women can be
found at work. And it is a surprise to find that these
are not aliens. Scotchmen, Irishmen. and Englishmen
can be found in as large a proportion as Jews and
Poles and other foreigners. The latter are mostly to
be found in the East-end.
  <p>Many of these people are the victims of selfish and
grasping middlemen, who undertake work at a good
price and get it done for a mere pittance. Such a
man will receive 7s. 6d. for the making of a pair of
trousers, and engage a woman to do the work at





<pb n=71>

1s. 6d. And these, as stated before, are not the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">cheap
clothes and nasty,</q> to use Kingsley's description in
<title>Alton Locke,</title> but clothes of best West-end production.
Sweating is by no means general, though undoubtedly far too common. There are many of the
middlemen and master tailors who pay fair wages,
according to what they receive. Though most of the
West-end tailoring is done by out-workers, there are
employers who have workshops where the sanitary
conditions under which the people labour are decidedly
better. They are not ground down to the lowest farthing like many of the poor outworkers, who, like the
shirt-makers of whom Hood sang, barter their very
flesh and blood for a small pittance.

<HEAD>The Diamond Club.</HEAD>
  <p>The Diamond Club does not court notice. It is,
of course, in Hatton Garden, the centre of the diamond
trade of the world, but the uninitiated might pass up
and down that busy thoroughfare many times a day
without noting its existence. No notice-board proclaims its whereabouts, but on the step of one of the
passages is nearly always to be seen a group of persons, and proceeding along the passage and up a
flight of steps there stands revealed a club where an
immense number of diamonds change hands every
day, and where are to be obtained a few curious sidelights on diamond dealing.
  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It is a bad day for diamonds,</q> remarks our chaperone. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Owing to the fog it is impossible to tell
the value of the stones. Otherwise you would see
these full.</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">These</q> were a number of partitions
like those in a telegraph office, only built for two.
Here buyer and seller stand and examine their wares.
A sale has evidently been affected in one, for one man
is folding up a little parcel, and another is handling a
cheque. Being a bad day for diamonds, there are not
many people using the club for business purposes,
though a number are sampling the culinary accomplishments of the cook, whose apartment is apparently
situated somewhere in the nether regions. Still, one
is able to get an insight into the characteristics of the
place, and they are in many respects very unconventional.






<pb n=73>



  <p>The Diamond Club is an upretententious place, and
the members unpretentious people. In answer to a
remark to this effect, our cicerone replies that though
they do not make much outward show of affluence,
many of them would have bags of diamonds in their
pockets of the greatest value. Evidence is soon forthcoming of the wonderful confidence they have in one
another, and of their general heedlessness in the matter of diamonds. A diamond broker never carries a bag.
His stock-in-trade is in neat little paper bags slipped
into the inside pockets of his coat. A broker is sitting
down having his chop. A purchaser comes along,
and whispers in his ear. Thereupon the broker takes
one of the little bags out of his pocket, hands it to the
other, who goes to the window at the other end of the
room to examine them, while the broker proceeds
with his dinner unconcernedly.
  <p>If the purchaser is satisfied with the stones and the
price, he gives his cheque, and the transaction is complete. But there is no abatement. The broker who
has received the diamonds from the merchant, who in
turn has received them from the diamond fields, has
them to sell at a certain price, and can take no less.
But there is a proceeding known as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">giving a seal.</q>
If the purchaser will not give the full price, but would
be willing to give a little less, he says so to the broker.
Thereupon the broker seals up the packet, impressing
his own seal upon it, and writing on it that Mr. Blank
offers so much. This he takes to the merchants, and
and if they agree the transaction is settled. The pur-
chaser cannot withdraw his offer, but is obliged to
take the goods. Of course there are disputes some-
times, Perhaps the purchaser has another chance of






<pb n=74>







buying what he wants at his own price, and, not
knowing whether the other merchants will accept his
offer, effects a purchase. He is chagrined to find his
offer accepted, and not wanting two lots, objects to
pay. The matter then comes before the directors of
the club, who sit as a Board of Arbitration, and they
decide according to the merits of the case, whether he
is to take the diamonds, or pay a certain sum to the
merchants for the bargain to be off.
  <p>The confidence which each party to the transaction
has in the other is only equalled by the unconcern-
it would be perhaps too severe to say carelessness-of
each as regards the diamonds themselves. It is no
uncommon thing, we are told, to find a bag of diamonds
lying about the club of the value of &pound;800 to &pound;1,000.
No one takes any notice, until at last an official of the
club takes charge of the packet until it is inquired for.
Of course this is only the result of the most scrupulous
care being exercised as to election to membership,
and the enforcement of rigid rules as to the admission
of strangers. The experiences of diamond dealers
were not always so pleasant; and that brings us to
the origin of the club. Only a year or two ago there
was no such place, and the diamond broking fraternity
used to affect a public-house a little down the street.
Naturally the company there was very mixed. As our
cicerone quaintly put it, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">When you took out a
parcel of diamonds from one pocket, you did not know
whose hand was in the other.</q> Yet, despite the danger of robbery, this went on for years, and might have
gone on to the present day had the public-house not
been pulled down. It then occurred to two men to
start a club. It was at once a success, but it was a






<pb n=75>



proprietary concern, and some of the members thought
it would be better to place it on a limited liability
basis. The project <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">took,</q> and the proprietors being
bought out, the club is now an assured success, and
looks forward to emulating Antwerp, where a club
formed years ago in the same way recently opened
palatial buildings.
  <p>The interior of the club-it has no exterior, being
on the two-pair-back principle-bears every sign of
newness. It is comfortable and homely rather than
luxurious, and is a social as well as a business club.
Diamond dealers find time to have a game of billiards,
and hang up their coats on the pegs round the billiard-
room, presumably with the diamonds still in the
pockets.  The members being mostly foreigners,
dominoes are much in evidence, and sometimes
there is a friendly game of cards, though the
rules strictly forbid gambling.  But it has this
unique feature in a London club that it opens its
doors at 10 o'clock in the morning, and is in full
swing shortly afterwards ; whereas at seven o'clock
in the evening its doors are shut.  The diamond
dealers are early birds, or if they want to stay out
late, they lock up their stock in a safe deposit.  It is
the aspiration of the directors of the diamond club to
ultimately build club premises of their own, and have
a safe deposit in their own vaults.  Whether the
diamond broker, who has been accustomed all his life
to carry his stock-in-trade in his pocket, would
welcome such a change, may be doubted, because a
broker is here, there, and everywhere, and likes to have his
diamonds with him to show on the earliest opportunity.  And there is this fact that may account for

<pb n=76>







his seeming carelessness, that except in cases where
the merchant is his own broker, the broker is under
no liability for the loss of the stones. He sells on
commission stones entrusted to him to sell.  If he
loses them the loss falls on the merchant.  But
inquiries only serve to show that cases of robbery and
loss are strangely rare, especially when we remember
the large value constantly carried about, that no
special precautions are taken, and no special protection sought for.
  <p>Another characteristic of the place is that, though
everybody may be safely presumed to have diamonds
in his pockets, no one wears even a single stone as an
ornament. Diamonds in the form of jewellery are as
scarce in Hatton Garden as the glossy silk hat of
the City and new suits of clothes.  Everyone seems
to cultivate a general seediness of aspect, and a visit
to the Diamond Club emphasises the thought that
must strike everyone on making the acquaintance of
Hatton Garden, that here at all events you must not
judge either buildings or men by their exterior.
Through some of these old buildings, that are little
better than rookeries, diamonds of great value pass
daily, and many of the men of shabby appearance are
men in affluent circumstances. So with the club; it
has no architectural pretensions, but as a diamond
exchange it is a place of much interest and
importance.

<HEAD>The London of Dickens; a Chat with Canon Benham.</HEAD>

  <p>The London which Dickens described, so minutely
and so accurately that almost every district and
building can be located, is fast disappearing, and but
little remains that is of interest. With that little no one
has a more intimate acquaintance than the Rev.
Canon Benham, who is not only a keen theologian,
but a great lover of literature, and an indefatigable
student of the archaeology of London, as to which his
knowledge, like that of Sam Weller, is <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">extensive and
peculiar.</q> The rev. gentleman gave a lecture the
other day on the life and writings of Dickens, and he
indicated in it that he had made diligent inquiry into
what might be termed the archaeology of the Dickens'
novels.
  <p>I found Canon Benham in the well-stocked library
of his house in Finsbury Square, and happened to
arrive at a specially opportune moment. The rev.
gentleman was just poring over a huge and ancient
map of London, and had made a discovery which had
evidently pleased him. It was nothing less than the
exact locality of the Saracen's Head mentioned in
<title>Nicholas Nickleby.</title> Dickens described it as the
place where the omnibus horses coming the other
way fall down whether or no.  <quote>I should never have
known where it was,</quote> said Canon Benham, <quote>if I had










<pb n=78>







not looked at this map of London last century. Here
it is marked on the map, close to where the police-
station now stands on Snow Hill.  Popular error
points to the Present Saracen's Head in Snow Hill,
but that is a modern house, not even near the old
one.</quote> My congratulations to the Canon on this led
him to mention that within the past few days he had
made another addition to his store of knowledge. At
the lecture, to which reference has been made, he had
read that part of the Pickwick Papers which
described Pickwick's visit to Messrs. Dodson and
Fogg, with regard to the breach of promise case; and
how Mr Pickwick, hot and angry, walking along
Cheapside with Sam Weller, expressed a wish for
some brandy, whereupon Sam ushered him into a
public-house, up one of the turnings. The only point
likely to lead to its discovery was Sam's injunction to
his master to take the box in the first fireplace:
because the table had no centre leg to it; and having
said this, the Canon ejaculated the wish that he could
see that table. A day or two later he got a letter
telling him that the house was in Honey Lane, and
losing no time in paying a visit to the place, he saw
the table, just as described, with a leg less than all its
fellows.
  <p>This conversation took place while the map still
lay open on the table, and Canon Benham drew
attention to the inns in Bishopsgate which used to be
there. It was the old coaching centre, and there
were marked on it <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Flowerpot,</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Bull,</q>
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Green Dragon,</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Four Swans,</q> and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The
Vine.</q> The inn where Ralph Nickleby went to attend
a meeting about muffins and crumpets used to be in









<pb n=79>



the neighbourhood of the old Southsea House, but the
licence was some years ago moved to a house in
Fenchurch Street. This neighbourhoodwas a favourite
one of Dickens', and Canon Benham, who knew him
well, remarked that the novelist once told him that
when he came to London he used to go to the Spread
Eagle in Gracechurch Street to see the start of the
coach which he knew would go past his father's
house. On the other side was the Swan-with-two-
Necks, where Estrella met Pip, and which is now a
receiving-house, though still called by the same name.
Pursuing still the conversation about most inns, the
interesting, Canon Benham thought, was the George,
in the Borough, for the reason that Dickens describes
the two galleries with balustrades outside, so constructed that when you went to bed it seemed as
though you went to your bedroom in the open air.
The George remains, and one of the two galleries is still
intact just as Dickens described it. This arrangment, though an uncommon one here, is frequently to
be met with on the Continent, where the bedrooms
open on to a gallery that looks like a courtyard.
<quote>As far as I know,</quote> added Canon Benham, <quote>the
George is the only inn left with these characteristic
galleries. I well remember seeing them in the old
Golden Cross, at Charing Cross, before it was rebuilt.
That, by the bye, was the inn with the low gateway,
about which Mr Jingle told the story of the lady
being decapitated while she was eating a sandwich.
I remember the old gateway well, and though the
story is apocryphal, you really had to <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">mind your
head.</q></quote>





<pb n=80>






  <p>So far the conversation had gone on rather disjointedly, but now sitting by the fire, Canon Benham,
in reply to an inquiry, said it was many years since
he first began to take an interest in the localities
mentioned by Dickens. In reading the books, and in
his personal knowledge of Dickens, he had been struck
by his marvellous power of describing localities. As
Forster very truly said of him, he had a keen eye for
details. If he walked down a street he could tell you
afterwards the names of all the tradespeople and
what they sold. The place seemed photographed on
his memory. Dickens was a man of London; there
are a very few places he described except London.
There is a little of Canterbury, but not much. There
is rather more of Rochester, and the Kent marshes are
described with remarkable accuracy and vividness
in <title>Great Expectations.</title>  Dickens, of course, lived
at Gad's Hill, which is on the way to Rochester.
His house was on the edge of the marshes, and
especially in his later life he was fond of making a study of them. One place he described with
the greatest faithfulness at Cowling, though he
did not give the name. But his great strength was
London, and it is a remarkable fact that his descriptions of places were so accurate that, though he
rarely gave the correct name of a street, houses and
places can be readily recognized.  Many of the
large places which he described, such as the Marshalsea, where his own father was confined, are removed,
but there still remain some of the smaller ones. The
public-house where <title>David Copperfield</title> had his glass
of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">genuine stunning,</q> is still in Parliament Street, at
the corner of Derby Street, though now turned into a


<pb n=81>







modern gin-palace, with much plate-glass and gaudy
adornment. Not far away, in exactly the same state
as when he described it, is the residence of the doll's
dressmaker of <title>Our Mutual Friend.</title> It is in a little
street going up to St. John's Church, Westminster-
a house with a green door.  The street is Church
Street, Westminster, and it is described so accurately
that it is impossible to make a mistake.  Sol Gill's
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">little midshipman</q> stands now at the door of
Messrs. Norrie and Wilson's in the Minories, having
been removed from Leadenhall Street. The house of
Mr. Grewgious, the lawyer of Staples' Inn, who
figures in Edwin Drood, still exists, with the initials
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">J.P.T.</q> above the doorway, about which Dickens
made so serious a point.
  <p>Dickens not only described houses and buildings,
but whole localities ; and one especially noteworthy
point, Canon Benham thought, was his description in
<title>Dombey and Son</title> of the making of the North
Western Railway.  As a rule, Dickens did not like
railways; almost all his novels deal with coaches and
coach-riding.  But he made Paul Dombey's nurse
live in Stagg's Gardens, situated where now the
Euston Station stands, and he described how it
appeared as though there had been an earthquake
there, owing to the pulling down of the houses to
make the station and the line.  That one bit of description was quite
historical.  Then in <title>Oliver
Twist</title> he was even more definite as to locality; and
took care that every place should be traced.  When
Oliver Twist came to London he entered it at the
Angel, Islington, and every step is described just it
might be seen now down to Field Lane, which was at




<pb n=82>







that time the chief haunt of the young London
thieves; though it must be remembered that Coppice
Row is now Farringdon Road, and Hockley-in-the-
Hole is Ray-street. Bill Sikes's house was in Spital-
fields.
  <p>Asked as to the <title>Old Curiosity Shop,</title> about which
a claim is put forward for a house near Clare Market,
Canon Benham said there really was no foundation
for this claim. It was beyond a doubt that the Old
Curiosity Shop, described by Dickens, and with which
he was very familiar, was in Fetter Lane, and had
been a few years ago.  Among other places still
remaining, some of them altered almost beyond
recognition, are the old churchyard, in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane, visited by Lady Dedlock, now a
recreation ground and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">open space</q>; the George
and Vulture, Lombard Street, where Sam Weller
knocked the Sheriff's Officer against the wall-Canon
Benham thought he had found the identical door
mentioned, but found on subsequent examination
that it was a modern substitute; the Old White
Hart, in the Borough, less changed than many others,
where Sam Weller was found; and the Bull, in Holborn, associated with Sairey Gamp and the sick
fever patient. In conclusion, Canon Benham said he
had spent much time, and had been greatly interested
in going over these places, and finding out spots associated with Dickens's works.  He had located all
in which he felt any special interest, with the exception of two. One of the two was the opium den
mentioned in <title>Edwin Drood</title>; and the other was a
house he had often tried to find, but without success.
It was the house of Mr. Whitfield, the lawyer in Can-





<pb n=83>

terbury.  There was one very much like it in the
High Street; but it did not quite answer. It was
possible that Dickens had blended two together. But
he wrote of it as having queer arabasques ; and in
that respect the house in High Street answered the
description.



<pb n=84>
<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=16>
<HEAD>A Stroll in Holywell Street.</HEAD>

   <p>Booksellers' Row in the Strand, or Holywell Street
as it used to be called, and is still called on maps and
in guide books, is a unique thoroughfare. It has a
history such as no other street has, rich in interest to
those who would trace the evolution of a typical
London street; it affords an unlimited field for moralising; and in the course of an hour it presents more
curious scenes to the student of human nature than
any other in the Metropolis. The guide-books admit
the picturesqueness which is given to it by the few
old lofty gabled houses which remain, but lament the
decayed interest of its old bookstalls, and the obtrusion of much that in better regulated thoroughfares is
not allowed to offend the eyes of the bulk of people
who pass along. In the course of a hurried walk
through the row this lament may be found to be
justified. It emphasises the state of decay into which
the row has fallen; and the place may be voted a ramshackle, tumbledown passage to be avoided rather
than frequented for entertainment and study. But the
searcher after the curious in every day life, who likes
to spend an idle hour in out of the way places, will
note many features the multitude do not see. The
people one meets are not all of them units in an uninteresting crowd; but are themselves worthy of study.
Holywell Street has its <foreign lang=fr>habitues</foreign>; and some singular
folks are to be found among them.






<pb n=85>

  <p>But first there is the street itself, which means, of
course, the shops on either side. Curious old rookeries
some of these are. The overhanging upper storeys
are not as they were when the place was a typical bit
of old London. If you see any old prints of London
before the great fire, with the proverbial couple shaking hands across the roadway, you may be sure it is
either Holywell Street, or Wych Street, where the
state of things was at the worst. When the fire came
these places burned like match-wood, and when the
buildings were re-erected a more sensible plan was
adopted. Some have again been pulled down, and re-
erected in the most uninteresting style of modern
domestic architecture. But there are others that are
eloquent of history. One almost begins straightway
to babble of green fields, though it is a far cry back
to the time when all around here were fields, outside
the city walls. Fitzstephens, describing London in
the reign of the second Henry, speaks of the excellent
springs at a small distance from the City, whose waters
were most sweet, salubrious, and clear, and whose
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">runnels</q> murmured over the shining stones. One of
these was that of Holywell. Then London began to
spread, and here was the west end. There are still
relics of the mansions of the great, and of the highwaymen who infested the neighbourhood when houses
were few and far between. These were the days when
the Strand was a strand, before the Fleet ditch had
been turned into a culvert, and when a rippling brook
ran down Milford Lane. Pepys mentions meeting
milk-maids here with garlands on their pails, and
wrote of the lively dancing around the may-pole which
stood on what is now the site of St. Mary-le-Strand.







<pb n=86>







The country fields having been cut up for the erection
of mansions, the process of evolution went on. As the
district got more crowded, the great folks went further
west.  The time came when this region had an
unsavoury reputation as the resort of thieves. There
used to be an old inn hereabouts, called the Red
Lion, which, on being pulled down revealed trapdoors, sliding panels, blind passages, &amp;c., in true
Sweeny Todd fashion.
  <p>The history of the place is fascinating ; but it is
time to turn to what the street is. Get rid of first
impressions; and you find that, though it is named
Booksellers' Row, the second-hand books play now a
subsidiary part in the business of the place. A good
many books are doubtless sold, but it is a mistake to
suppose that the reputation of the row is fabulous in
this respect, because second-hand books here fetch
prices almost as high as new, and frequently much
higher. You go into one shop to buy a book and they
ask what seems a ridiculous price for it, and you
leave; you go into a second and a third, and are inclined to think your estimate of its value is wrong, as
there could otherwise scarcely be so much unanimity
among different dealers. But if you are more than
ordinarily observant, and have had a little experience of
the place, you will find that you have been closely
watched, and that you have been simply asking the
price at different shops of the same proprietor; for
though there are many second-hand book-shops in
Holywell Street there are very few second-hand book-
dealers, and so prices are kept up at a ridiculously
high rate. It is utterly useless to ask for an abatement of a penny, even though you offer to buy books









<pb n=87>



to the value of thirty or forty shillings. They see you
walk away with the most philosophic indifference.
Apart from books you can buy anything in Holywell
Street, either to eat, to drink, or to wear: you can invest in the fine arts, purchase bric-a-brac, jewellery,
cycles, fire-arms-the place is quite a commercial
compendium-you can be shaved, can have legal
advice, and are sure to find an auction of some kind
going on.
  <p>One exception must be made to the commodities
purchasable in the row. It is only on very rare occasions that you can buy a newspaper in it. The paper
boys all prefer the busier Strand, and rarely try their
fortune here. On the other hand the row has some
peripatetic vendors peculiar to it. The man who sells
a penny budget of comic songs and proclaims their
titles in stentorian tones and in a very humorous way,
is rarely to be seen elsewhere. He walks up and down,
and does not venture out into the more open thorough-
fares, where the sound of his voice would immediately
bring upon him a <foreign lang=la>posse</foreign> of policemen. There is a
man, too, who sells knives, who is quite a character;
a thin, cadaverous looking fellow, with a small box,
containing a small collection of pen-knives. He is
seen to appear suddenly in the centre of the row, drop
on his knees, open his box, and arrange his wares. A
small crowd is soon gathered round him, and he
begins an harrangue about the knives, going on for
some five minutes or so without making an effort to
sell them. Then he starts up, looks restlessly round,
and darts off at great speed. Why he does so is not
apparent, for it does not appear that the police are in
sight, and if they are they do not interfere much with






<pb n=88>







these people. You may perhaps see him repeat this a
dozen or more times, before you find him actually
selling knives, though when he does he generally disposes of them with great rapidity; and you have a
dim idea that it is due to the curiosity he has excited.
  <p>Then there is the man who sells a sort of quartz
that cuts glass; a vendor in disinfecting ribbon that
emits a pungent odour; and now and again a man
who tells you how to take instantaneous photographs,
and sells you the apparatus for a penny, the apparatus
being a piece of glass with metal rim: on the glass a
donkey's head has been drawn in soap and wiped off,
but when it is breathed on the image is visible. These
are varied by sellers of collar-studs and sleeve-links,
at the rate of three or four a penny, and a host of
other cheap commodities; the curious features of the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">open market</q> being that there is a constant change
in the <foreign lang=fr>personnel</foreign> of the vendors, who appear and disappear
in a rather unaccountable fashion. The musicians are the longest stayers, and of these a familiar
couple is a blind fiddler and a woman with the remnant of a once good voice. Then to the stranger there
is the curious sight of the children in lines across the
roadway at either end of the row, dancing to the music
of a barrel organ that never seems to go away. In the
courts and alleys round about live hosts of children,
who are employed in the winter as pantomime fairies,
and who seem to have plenty of time for <foreign lang=it>al fresco</foreign>
practice. It is noticeable that they all dance the same
simple step; but the grace of some of these unkept
girls is remarkable.





<pb n=89>

  <p>These are a few of the features of the place, which
mark it out from the broader thoroughfares where the
obstructions which count for nothing in narrow
passages would not be tolerated. These street scenes,
which are not allowed in provincial towns with any
pretensions to good government, are among the most
curious features of London; and nowhere are they
more varied than in Holywell Street.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=17>
<HEAD>Paved with Gold.</HEAD>
  <p>The old idea that London streets were paved with
gold was, and to a certain extent is still, supposed to
be indigenous to the rustic mind, and to have led in
every day life, as well as in pantomime, to much
mental affliction when the grim and grimy reality
was experienced.  To suggest in this eminently
practical age that there was any truth in it, would
seem to invite ridicule. Yet Alderman Treloar, who
is a trustworthy authority on City matters-seeing
that he only recently retired from the chairmanship
of the Commission of Sewers-had the hardihood to
do it, and instead of being met with derision he only
excited a feeling of surprise. For he made it known
that if the streets of the City are not actually paved
with golden ingots there is daily swept up and
collected from the streets-often including, as will be
shown, specimens of the precious metal itself-that
which is turned into gold to the tune of some
thousands of pounds a year. The brief details he
gave as to how this was accomplished seemed to
indicate that there was much interesting information
to be procured as to the unconsidered trifles which it
is one of the duties of the Commissioners of Sewers
to dispose of.
  <p>Alderman Treloar was found at the offices of the
Commissioners at the Guildhall, and very readily
consented not only to substantiate his statement as






<pb n=91>



to the streets being paved with gold, but to act the
part of the good fairy, and to show the transmutation
process in actual operation. At the outset he warned
his visitor that there would be none of the glamour of
the footlights, and the warning was well founded. It
is not by the waving of a tinselled wand that the
refuse of the City is turned into gold, but by processes in which one is brought into contact with much
that is grimy unto foulness. Ninety huge horses,
standing seventeen hands high, attached to great
carts, are daily used in the collection of the City
refuse; and by them it is taken to Lett's Wharf, in
close proximity to Waterloo Bridge on the Surrey
side, where everything that is of the slightest value is
extracted and sold, and the remainder burned. It was
with a view of showing the surprising extent to which
the rubbish of the City is found to be of value that
Alderman Treloar consented to act the part of
cicerone, and explain not only why certain seemingly
valueless things were picked out, but why they were
selected, and what was their ultimate destination.
  <p>To begin, then, with the wharf. It is not the
unsavoury place one would suppose.   The disagreeablenesses attaching to the business are brought
down to the irreducible minimum, and really leave
no room for complaint.  The rule of the wharf,
rigidly adhered to, is that everything is to be disposed
of with the greatest promptitude, even at a considerable sacrifice upon the value of the unique
commodities which the Commissioners have for sale.
Nothing is kept on hand with a view to securing a
better market; the first comer has it at his own price.
Take, for example, the heap of tin cans we see first






<pb n=92>







on entering the wharf. These are being carted away
in a huge waggon by a man who keeps this waggon
in constant use for the purpose, there being a never
ending supply and he taking all he can get. There
are meat tins, old buckets, dilapidated baths,
collapsed coal-boxes, and tin ware of all kinds.
Asked what is to be done with it, he says the main
product is the solder, which is very valuable, and is
first extracted. But there is, especially among the
meat tins and tins that have been used for preserved
fruit and fish, much bright tin which, when cleaned,
can be used over again for other purposes. It is
curious to learn that a large quantity goes abroad,
where it is cut up into tin soldiers and toys that, with
a touch of paint, are sent back to delight the children
in our nurseries.  What is useless for these purposes
is melted down.
  <p>Hence we go on to witness what is really the initial
process, the sifting of the refuse. The waggons, as
they enter with their loads, are emptied in the centre
of a covered yard, round the outside of which are the
women who are employed as sifters. It looks an
unpleasant process, but the work is not badly paid,
and in addition to the wages there is always the
tempting prospect of a haul, for any money they find
which cannot be identified they are allowed to keep,
and these finds are far more frequent than would be
imagined. If they discover a purse and there is anything in it to lead to identification the things are given
up. Only a few weeks ago a purse was found with a
&pound;5 note, some gold and silver, and a first-class season
ticket in it. This was duly returned to the owner,
who rewarded the woman with half-a-crown. Postage









<pb n=93>



stamps are frequently found-once to the amount of
fifty shillings. On another occasion a woman found
two bank notes, and the owner gave her 10s. Cheques
and season tickets are also found, and only recently
one of the women came across several boxes of kid
gloves, quite new and uninjured. But the aim of the
Commissioners is not to restore valuable articles to
careless people. That is only a detail of the work.
What we have come to see is with what dexterity
things of little or no value are collected. Bones go
into one heap, string into another, rags are carefully
put together, odd scraps of ironmongery and cutlery
are put on one side; in short, everything is carefully
sorted by the women through sieves, which are filled
for them by a man who waits on them with a shovel.
  <p>Chatting over the value of these things, it is curious
to learn that next to the tin the string is the most
valuable. Even the smallest piece is not despised;
and it is astonishing how clean it looks when the
dust is shaken from it. There is a ready market for
it, string making the best kind of note-paper. The
bottles are carefully collected, and those that are not
broken are sold to be cleaned and used up again. So
great is the collection of ink bottles that the makers
find they can buy them back and clean them at a
cheaper rate than they can get new. Ginger beer and
aerated water bottles, with maker's name on them,
go back to the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bottle clearing-house,</q> and so find
their way back to the bottlers. The broken bottles
and odd pieces of glass go to another heap, and are
destined to be ground down for glass paper. Bones
go to the soap makers, paper and rags to the paper
mills, corks to the cork cutters, where they are cleaned




<pb n=94>







and cut down to smaller sizes; the iron is melted
down again, and there is even a market for the
remnants of the composition from printers' rollers.
The fire ashes are carted off to the brickfields, being
used to mix with theclay forthe making of bricks,while
the coarser ashes-which are sometimes in the nature
of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">breezes</q>-are used in the brick kilns to feed the
fires. After all these things have been picked out
there remains, of course, a great deal of no use at all,
mainly dirt, and bits of rotten wood, straw, and such
like. This is all shovelled back into specially
constructed waggons, wnich, when drawn to the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">destructors,</q> are taken up bodily on pulleys, and
emptied into one of the ten huge furnaces, in which
they are burned until only a remnant of clinker
remains.
  <p>Asked why the Commissioners did not go further
and utilise the calcined products in the making of
flagstones, as was done in one or two municipal
boroughs, Alderman Treloar said this had been
tried in London. In the first place a committee
went into the provinces, and saw how it was
done. They found in some towns stables, walls,
and even houses built of the concrete made in
this way from refuse, and came back so satisfied with the success of the process that they
erected mortar mills to grind down the calcined
refuse, and make the concrete blocks.  But they
could find no market for it, and had to admit
that it was not of the same good quality as that
made in the provinces, because the London refuse
was lacking in <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">grit.</q>  Owing to its price people
here are more economical with their coal, and there is



<pb n=95>

nothing like the same proportion of ashes.  So this
scheme fell through after a time; and the Commissioners are content with the various processes that have
been described. As Ald. Treloar remarked, if London
streets are not <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">paved with gold,</q> the authorities
manage to get gold out of what would otherwise litter
the pavements.  Their object is not to make money
but to keep the streets clean; and a system that
does both must be worthy of commendation.

<HEAD>In a Refrigerator.</HEAD>

  <p>We step upon the floor of a large lift that has no
seats, nothing to lean against, and nothing to hold on
to.  The word is given to let go; and we seem to
fall through space, for the pace is some fifty times
quicker than the luxurious hotel lifts work at.  In a
few moments we have left light and noise behind; and
though the atmosphere above was something considerably over freezing point, and we are well wrapped up,
there is an icier coldness which makes us button our
coats closer, turn our collars well up round our necks,
and thrust our hands in our pockets. We are bound for
a region where every day in the year, summer and
winter alike, air is reduced to an even temperature of
sixty degress below zero Fahrenheit, where, though
the sun may be shining in the streets above with
summer heat, there is always some five or six inches
of snow to be seen, and where everthing is frozen
hard as iron. In a word we are about to explore the
refrigerators of the Cold Air Stores Company, in the
vaults underneath the poultry market, entered from
West Smithfield.
  <p>We are met by a man clad as though for arctic
exploration, bearing an oil lamp, which is to give us
all the light we shall have.  He immediately unbars
a heavy door, that we notice is some six inches thick,
invites us to enter hurriedly, and as hurriedly closes
the door behind that none of the cold air shall be lost.










<pb n=97>



If we were chilly before we begin to freeze now; and
have to hurry on to preserve our remaining warmth. It
is an uninviting place. As the lamp is flashed round
the vault, we see that the walls and ceiling are white
with snow and frost. It is not the soft, crumbly hoar
frost such as we are familiar with in the country roads;
but little scales of ice, which glisten in the light, and
show wondrous tints of colour, like so many sparkling
jewels.  The place has not been built with an eye to
architectural effect.  There is no groyned roof; no
massive pillars; or it might look wicrd, and exercise
a certain fascination over the visitor. Instead everything is of the roughest. It is simply a succession of
short passages some twelve or fourteen feet wide, and
about twelve feet high, each separated from the other
by heavily-barred doors; and the generally uninviting
aspect of the place is rendered more gruesome by
piles of carcases of sheep, heaped one above the other
on the floor ; varied by quarters of beef, and here and
there boxes of game and piles of hares frozen rigid.
Our guide picks up one, and throwing it on the
ground it sounds like a piece of iron.  The meat is
equally hard, and if you beat it with your hand it is
like beating at an iron block.  As we go on from
vault to vault, the air gets gradually colder and less
bearable, the incrustation of ice around more thick,
and the wind we meet as we walk has a keener and
more icy bite. We are coming nearer the source of
supply, where the air is at its coldest, and where we
get among heaps of game that is being frozen in order
to supply vessels going on long voyages. We are not
sorry when we at last leave the vaults and go to see
the cold air in process of manufacture.









<pb n=98>







  <p>We are in light and warth again, and though there
is a strong oleaginous flavour about the atmosphere
it is preferable for a while.  Here, in another vault
we are among huge cylinders, and an interminatable
network of pipes.  The clatter of the engines has
stopped for a time; there has been a burst in one of
the pipes; and the engineer explains how the cold
is made.  It is exceedingly simple, being produced
solely by the compression of the air.  No chemicals
are used here, though in some processes anhide of
ammonia is used in addition to the compression.
But that does not appear to to be necessary.  The
cylinders-which are much the same in appearance as
those in other manufacturies, except that they are
much bigger-fill themselves with air; the engine
then drives the piston rod down, and the air which
occupied some three feet of space, is flattened down to a
thickness-if such a description is permissible-of
about a quarter of an inch.  What has happened no
one has yet adequately explained; but the rapid pressure seems to have taken the heat out of the air; for
that is reduced to a temperature of some 60deg. below
zero, or 90deg. of frost, while the iron of the cylinder
has become proportionately hotter, rendering it
necessary for a stream of cold water to be kept constantly flowing over it. The compressed air finds an
exit into a huge box, where by a similar cylindrical
action it is forced into the feeding-pipes and conducted
to the vaults. The box is called the snow box,
because the moisture that was in the air freezes into
snow, and for some distance along the air passages this
snow falls, and would block them up if it were not
removed. The engineer lifts up a trap door in one of










<pb n=99>



the air passages and we see adhering to it snow, of
the purest and softest character, to the depth of several
inches; while looking into the chamber we see that
it is caked all round in the same way with snow of
dazzling whiteness.
  <p>Day and night the process goes on, for it is an important point that the air should not only be kept at
a low, but an    equable temperature.  This is
easily managed as far as the vaults themselves are
concerned, because by opening and closing the trapdoors in the air-chamber which run through them the
cold supply can be reduced or cut off entirely.  Altogether there is accommodation in these vaults alone
for seventy thousand carcases of sheep; and the
vaults have proved a great boon to the meat salesmen
in the neighbourhood, who in the summer would
otherwise have tons of meat rendered unsaleable. As
a means of storage they are invaluable; and it is not
surprising to hear that the authorities in Paris are
preparing huge refrigerators on the same plan, where
large supplies of meat could be promptly frozen and
stored in case of war.  They are animated doubtless
by the remembrance of the horrors of the last seige.
Nothing of that kind is to apprehended in London.
The vaults here have been constructed mainly in connection with the supply of frozen meat, which, imported from New Zealand and other places, is brought
over in specially built boats, with refrigerating
chambers ; transferred to special barges built on the
same principle, and thus brought nearly to the
market, where, transferred to the vaults, it can be
kept wholesome until distributed throughout the
country. The frozen meat trade has grown to wonderful






<pb n=100>

proportions.  Though it was only commenced in
<datestruct value="1880--"><year>1880</year></datestruct>, the last completed returns show an importation
for the year of nearly three and a half millions of
carcases, as compared with four hundred in the year
of trial. Of this upwards of a half came to London,
the rest being imported at Liverpool. That the trade
will continue to grow there can be no doubt.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=19>
<HEAD>Drivers' Day at Marlborough Street.</HEAD>
  <p>The interior of Marlborough Street Police Court
presented a curious appearance one afternoon. There
was none of the bustle and liveliness which generally
distinguishes a magisterial sitting. The drunk and
disorderlies had been disposed of in the morning, and
the long list of felonies and misdemeanours having
been got through, defendants and their friends had
gone their various ways. Even the usual court
loungers, whom very little will satisfy in the way of
interest, had gone away, regarding the daily entertainment as at an end. And yet the Court was
crowded. Down one side were two long and closely
packed seats of policemen; and behind the dock in
serried rank, four deep, were rows of cabmen and
omnibus drivers, with their yellow and white badges
conspicuously displayed on their breasts.  It was
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Drivers' Day,</q> and some 70 or more had come up-
as similar battalions come up twice or thrice a week,
on pressing invitations issued on blue paper-to pass
in review before Mr Newton. So formal are the
interviews, and so regular the result, that the general
public never honour the afternoon sitting with their
presence. And yet it furnishes the contemplative
mind with an abundance of material for reflection,
while not a few humorous incidents help to wear
away pleasantly an otherwise tedious afternoon.





<pb n=102>
Two or three questions begin to obtrude themselves
upon the attention after a few of the cases have been
called on. Foremost among these is the problem
why Piccadilly Circus should yield so many more
cases of delinquency on the part of omnibus-drivers
and cabmen than any other place in London. There
are other spots where the traffic is as much, if not
more, congested than here. As, for instance, where
Wellington Street crosses the Stand, at the Mansion
House-which is generally regarded as the busiest
spot in London, and at the Elephant and Castle.
But yet the number of offences at these places on the
part of licensed drivers is wonderfully small compared
with the large number which render these afternoon
sittings at Marlborough Street a continual necessity.
Curious emphasis is lent to this by the official returns,
for they show that during one period 216 drivers were
brought up at Marlborough Street, whereas in the
City Courts the number was only 39, and at Bow
Street 41, Can there be something in the air of
Piccadilly which makes omnibus drivers and cabmen
recklessly defy the law; or is it that the Marlborough
Street authorities are more exacting, and not disposed
to allow so much latitude.
  <p>But the spirit of inquiry is checked by the amusing
features which crop up. It is a bit of a drawback
from the entertaining point of view that so many of
the men go through their trial with despondent
nonchalance. They look as depressed as though they
had seen over the door <quote>All hope abandon, ye who
enter here.</quote> All of them, too, have a hand in their
trousers pocket, and there is a suspicion of a chink, as
though they were preparing for the final performance.






<pb n=103>



But one soon sees that these are the old birds, who
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">know the ropes.</q> As their names are called they
walk in front of the dock. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Guilty or not guilty,</q>
asks the inspector who has called the names. And
the old hand says <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">guilty,</q> and never a word more.
Well he knows there is little hope of the police
evidence breaking down, and experience has taught
him that by pleading guilty he gets off with a fine of
6d, or at the most 1s and costs, whereas if he defends
himself, or impugns the evidence of the constable, it
is half-a-crown or 5s. Useless it is to plead that he
stopped for a passenger, or was hemmed in by other
vehicles.  Equally useless to plead, as one conductor did, that two nervous old ladies got into the
omnibus, and he, at their earnest request, did not start
the 'bus until they were seated. Unlucky gallantry
-it cost him a fine and costs which absorbed some
four or five shillings of his hard earned weekly wage.
  <p>Almost equally hopeless is it for the unfortunate
driver to have any witnesses, for the offence has been
committed a month ago. While he has been going on
in blissful ignorance, some sharp-eyed policeman
has noted an irregularity and dotted down his number,
with the result that three weeks later he gets a
summons, and perhaps he has a hazy notion what it
is for-perhaps he has not. Maybe he has driven
into Piccadilly at the rate of five miles an hour instead
of four-in the opinion of the policeman. Down goes
his number for <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">wanton driving.</q> Perhaps he has
unwarily lifted his whip and muttered <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Cab, sir.</q>-as
cabmen will.   His number is inscribed in the
Argus-eyed policeman's book for <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">plying for hire.</q>
By way of variety, one cabman was fined for allowing

<pb n=104>







himself to get hemmed in among other vehicles. Mr
Newton told him he should not have been there. As
he had not got a fare he should have gone to a cabstand. Another was fined for standing at a place where
there is a notice that it is a cab-stand. Mr Newton
told him the notice had no right to be there, and
ordered the police to remove it. The unlucky wight,
for not knowing that it ought not to have been there,
paid 1s and costs, and went out a sadder as well as a
wiser man.
  <p>Here is a case which is quite a comedy of errors.
Albert McGowan is an omnibus driver, and more
than usually gentlemanly looking. He got ill one
night, and, no authorised driver being in the yard,
a handy man about the place was put on his box.
It was a foggy night, and it was thought he would
pass muster. But the unlucky man, not knowing the
niceties of the position, drew up on a crossing to
let a passenger get out.  The constable on duty
saw him, and, not being able to get up to him
in time to take his number, so quick was he in
going on, jotted down the number of the omnibus.
Subsequent inquiry elicited the fact that McGowan
is the regular driver of that omnibus, and forth a
summons went to him. Still ill, he did not appear,
but his unlucky deputy attended in his stead. This
was last week. Justice was outraged by his non-
attendance, and the company was fined 5s and costs
for not producing him, another mandate going forth
for his attendance. Yesterday he was present, and
explanation ensued. The deputy stood forward and
acknowledged his error. Mr Newton looked rather
puzzled, but clearly McGowan could not be fined, and
so the summons was dismissed.





<pb n=105>



  <p>Another feature of the day was that in every case,
almost without exception, where omnibus men were
charged with loitering, the testifying policeman said
the omnibus remained stationary for <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">two minutes.</q>
Never more, never less. Sometimes the constable
had timed it by his own watch ; in other cases by a
clock in a shop,' but it was ever <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">two minutes.</q> Mr.
T. Duerdin Dutton, who appeared on behalf of the
London General Omnibus Company-hopelessly-to
defend ten of their men, got rather curious on the
point, and questioned the constables rather closely,
though, of course, without shaking their testimony.
At last Mr. Newton, seeing that Mr Dutton was
puzzled, explained that doubtless it arose from a rule
he had himself laid down, that no cases were to be
brought before him where the loitering had not lasted
at least two minutes. He had been asked to
adjudicate in cases where the omnibus or cab had
loitered for a minute, but he thought some little
allowance should be made for the eagerness of the
conductors to get passengers. And so the hard and
fast line is two minutes, and anyone who passes
Piccadilly Circus and sees a police, watch in hand,
with one eye on an omnibus and the other on his
chronometer, may know that the vehicle is being
timed for the regulation two minutes. It says
something for the omnibus men that none of the
police witnesses complained of the men overstepping
the two minutes, so that if Mr. Newton, in his
discretion, could have given two minutes' grace
instead of one, he would have been relieved of the
trouble of trying some score or two of cases yesterday,
But it is not much to the credit of the shrewdness of






<pb n=106>







the men that they are not content with a minute and
three-quarters, and so escape the penalty, because, of
course, the police are not so eager to show their zeal
as to strain the rule by a few seconds. Some of the
delinquents had the temerity to say that this was so,
but naturally they would be prejudiced. So, at least,
thought Mr. Newton, who, believing the policemen,
invariably fined the men.
  <p>One man did get off, but in this case the policeman
informed the conductor he should report him for overstaying the two minutes, and a good - natured
passenger, who did not corroborate the constable,
came forward to swear that it was not so, and the
summons was very properly dismissed. The others
had no witnesses, and having only their own word to
offer against the police evidence, cashed up with more
or less good grace.
  <p>In this connection it is necessary to state that some
of the men complained that, owing to their not receiving any warning at the time, and to the summons
being served three weeks or a month after the offence,
it was impossible for them to bring evidence. Mr.
Dutton took up this point, and argued it at some
length, even going so far as to denounce it as unfair.
To this expression Mr. Newton promptly objected,
pointing out that it would be highly inconvenient in
the office if summonses were to be issued within a
week. This could not be done without having a special
court and special officers for these cases alone; and if
Mr. Dutton wanted that he could apply to the Home
Secretary, who alone had the power to oblige him.
Further, that if men committed offences they must
suffer for them, and if they did not and still suffered,





<pb n=107>

they were very unfortunate. To all this the men
listened with the same stolid air of nonchalance which
characterised them throughout, and, when all the three
score and ten had paid up their various amounts, with
the exception of the two who had got off and two or
three whose cases were adjourned, the court closed.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=20>
<HEAD>The Westminster Abbey Waxworks.</HEAD>



  <p>In his efforts to popularise Westminster Abbey as
one of the sights of London, Dean Bradley recently
decided on an innovation, which has met with many
signs of public approval. Formerly the weird exhibition of wax effigies, which has for the past eighty
years occupied Abbot Islip's Chantry, in the north
ambulatory, was shown only to those who had a
special order from the Dean. It was possibly thought
that these dust-stained figures on which the relics of
former grandeur are in rags and tatters, had no attraction for the ordinary visitor; that it partook rather
of the nature of a chamber of horrors, and was not to
be seen promiscuously, or come upon unawares, but
only of set purpose. Whatever the reason, the limitation was in force for many years, with the result that
few ever saw the effigies, and comparatively few of
the visitors to the Abbey were aware even of their
existence. Now, however, they are included in the
ordinary round of sight-seeing; and on free days as
many as eighty persons will climb the rather rickety
staircase which ascends from the chapel where is the
tomb of Abbot Islip, and which is used as the Bishops'
robing-room on great occasions, to the upper story, in
which the effigies are crowded together in great glass
cases. The show is curious, and has the great advantage, from a spectacular point of view, of being
absolutely unique; but it cannot be said that the





<pb n=109>

effigies are fair to look upon. They are apt to upset
the ideas one has formedas to the personal beauty of
thekings and queens and other notables whom they
depict, the more so that the visitor is assured that
most of them were modelled from casts taken from
the face soon after death, and that the moth-eaten
robes are those which each wore in life.
  <p>But before going further it should perhaps be explained that the effigies are the remains of an ancient
custom, that at the funeral of a king, or great man,
his <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">lively effigy,</q> habited in his robes or uniform,
and dressed to imitate life, should be carried before
his remains on their way to burial. These effigies, of
which only eleven now remain, were made for that
purpose, and were so used. After the funerals they
were set up as temporary monuments in the Abbey,
and before they were brought together and placed in
Abbot Islip's chantry they were scattered over the
building. That of Charles the Second, which is the
oldest, stood, according to the testimony of Dean
Bradley, for two centuries in the south aisle of Henry
VII.'s Chapel, and formed his only monument. From
the same authority we learn that the Royal effigies
in the Abbey can be traced back to the fourteenth
century. Up to Henry V.'s time the embalmed bodies
of the sovereigns, and not the effigies, were exposed
to view. The earlier effigies were not of wax, but of
wood, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">some with heads, hands, and feet of plaster;
a few had wigs and the faces were painted.</q> Tradi-
tion has it that in a cupboard somewhere in the Abbey
are gathered together a gruesome collection of the
battered remnants of these effigies, but neither bribe
nor importunity will prevail on the vergers to show






<pb n=110>







them. Dean Bradley says they are too ghastly a
sight to be exposed to view ; and when one has seen
the waxen effigies the desire to see more is not very
great in the mind of the average visitor.
  <p>Some of the figures are of no great historical
interest. Catherine, Duchess of Buckinghamshire, and
her young son, for instance, were not very famous
personages. These effigies used to stand by the Duke
of Buckinghamshire's monument. The Duchess wears
the brocaded robes she wore at the coronation of
George II., but so dust-begrimed and moth-eaten are
they that practically no idea at all can be formed of
their original beauty. The effigy of her other son, the
last Duke of Buckinghamshire, is not able as being the
last carried at a funeral. Then we come to the
Duchess of Richmond, in the robes she wore at the
coronation of Queen Anne; and near her face is the
stuffed green parrot that lived with her for forty
years, and died a few days later than she did. The
huge farthingale is one the Queen wore in life. Pitt,
Earl of Chatham, in his peer's robes, has a particularly
dirty face, and the figure generally seems in a state
of collapse. Then we pass on to Queen Anne, fat,
placid, and gorgeous, and, after a passing glance at
Charles II., slight and shrewd, not to say shrivelled,
see William and Mary in one case. The Queen
stands erect by the side of her diminutive husband,
who, the guide is careful to point out, is standing on
a stool, in order not to be looked down upon by his
Queen. In the next case is the ghastly figure of
Elizabeth. This effigy the visitor is told is not the
contemporary one, but was constructed when the
other fell to pieces in <datestruct value="1760--"><year>1760</year></datestruct>. The original figure was









<pb n=111>



quite worn out in <datestruct value="1708--"><year>1708</year></datestruct>, the only remains of the royal
robes mentioned by the old writers being <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">a dirty old
ruff.</q>
   Another of the effigies which is admittedly not
altogether original is that of Nelson, which, however,
is said to have been modelled from a smaller figure
for which he sat. The clothes, except the coat, were
actually worn by him at some time or other; and the
hat is to this extent authentic that, Maclise, when he
painted <title>The Death of Nelson,</title> borrowed it to copy.
Of this effigy a curious story is told by the Dean.
The burial of Nelson at St. Paul's drew so many
people, and the Abbey had so few visitors for some
time afterwards, that as a counter attraction the
Admiral's effigy was made, and set up among the
waxworks, with the result of attracting the public
interest and bringing crowds of visitors to the Abbey.
The Dean and Chapter of former days had great faith
in the waxworks as a means of making money, and
apparently not without reason. When the figure of
the Earl of Chatham was added, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">at considerable expense,</q> the entrance fee was raised from 3d. to 6d., at
which sum it still remains on paying days. This, too,
like that of Nelson, was not a funeral effigy, but was
set up after the custom of making them for funerals
had ceased, solely as a money-making speculation.
  <p>A still greater curiosity than the effigies is the suit
of armour which is reputed to have been worn on the
battle-field by General Monk. What is most remarkable about it is its extraordinarily small size. One's
preconceived idea is that Monk was a man of fine
physique, but if this armour fitted him he must have
been a dwarf, almost as broad as long. This may











<pb n=112>



account for Guizot writing of him that <quote>he had on
greatness of soul, for his body could not possibly have
contained one of more than the most moderate proportions.</quote> Dumas, too, may have had this suit of
armour in his mind when he described in <title>The
Viscomte de Bragelonne</title> D' Artagnan's exploit of
packing Monk in a box and taking him across the
sea as a present to Charles II. It would not have required a very big
box. The famous cap mentioned in<title>The Ingoldsby Legends,</title> which, according to Goldsmith, was used by the verger in his days for
collecting coppers from visitors, has disappeared, but the
battered old armour still exists, and its story is told
by the vergers, in whose company the visit to the
chantry must of necessity be made. They have something to say, too, about each of the wax figures, which
form what Walpole fittingly described as <quote>ragged
regiment</quote>; and, if the sight is not of the most agreeable character, the visitor has the satisfaction of
having seen the oldest waxworks in existence.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=21>
<HEAD>The <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Picturesque Legacy</q> in Westminster.</HEAD>
  <p>From both the sentimental and the severely
utilitarian points of view much has been written with
regard to Emanuel Hospital, and the plea for the
continued existence of its present building in James
Street, Westminster; but practically no notice has
been taken of certain points in its history, which give
a glamour of real human interest to the place,
emphasising as they do the great social revolution
which has been wrought since the much-vaunted days
of Good Queen Bess.  The three centuries that have
passed since Lady Dacre, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">of pious memory,</q> ex-
pressed her charitable intentions in the quaint
language of the day, have been so full of change that
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">picturesque legacy,</q> as it has not been inaptly
called, may almost be said to comprise a romance in
brick and mortar.  Certainly as compared with the
more business-like methods of the present day the
early history of the charity has in it many elements
that are fantastic, and which throw a curious light
upon the social life of the sixteenth century. As the
place is doomed now beyond all hope, and its decaying bricks and mortar, together with the crumbling
ironwork, will, despite the outcry of the sentimentalists, soon be brought under the auctioneer's
hammer, a little glimpse into the ideas of its founder
and early managers may be regarded with interest.






<pb n=114>







  <p>Of Lady Dacre, who founded the hospital, little is
known, except that she was the sister of Elizabeth's
Minister, Lord High Treasurer Buckhurst, and that
these two were the only children of Winifred, daughter
of Sir John Brydges, who was Lord Mayor of London
in <datestruct value="1520--"><year>1520</year></datestruct>, by her first husband, Sir Richard Sackwell.
Her tombstone tells us that she was a lady of
exemplary piety. By her will, which was dated <datestruct value="1594-12-20"><day type=number>20th</day>
<month>December</month>, <year>1594</year></datestruct>, she related in almost pathetic terms
how she had long been minded to build <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">a hospitall,</q>
and set apart a sum of  &pound;110 in money <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">for the building and edification " thereof, and &pound;40 a year " in lands
for ever,</q> towards the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">reliefe of the aged poor and
the bringing up of children in vertue and lawdable
artes.</q> The poor lady seems to have so occupied her
mind during the latter portion of her life with thinking out the details of this scheme, that after her death
she could not leave the place, but wandered about the
building when in due course it came to be erected. So
much, indeed, did these ghostly visitations disturb the
repose of twenty aged pensioners upon her bounty
that it is reported that her spirit had to be solemnly
exorcised with <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bell, book, and candle,</q> and all the
formula appertaining to that solemn religious service,
the local clergyman at the urgent request of the timid
hospitallers undertaking the ceremony. It appears to
have been effectual, for no further ghostly appearances
are on record.
  <p>Could, however, Lady Dacre once again <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">revisit the glimpses of the moon,</q> she would marvel
to find that by a process of unearned increment,
which had not been discovered in her day, her
modest &pound;110 had swollen in value to something





<pb n=115>



like &pound;40,000 ; for that is the price at which
the existing building and land is now   valued.
Greater still, perhaps, would be her surprise at the
change in the manners and customs of the people,
and in the rules and regulations by which the
pensioners are governed. A strange old world place
it was when her uneasy spirit hovered over it. Before
admission could be gained to its hallowed precincts,
the candidate was to recite the Lord's Prayer, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the
articles of the Christian beliefe,</q> and the Ten
Commandments.    He (or she) was to formally
declare he was no enemy <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">to the Gospels of God,</q>
no swearer, thief, piker, hedge-breaker, scold, or
drunkard. He must either have served <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Grigorie,
Lord Dacre,</q> or <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">become miserable, poor, lamed,
or maymed by sickness,</q> been born blind, or brought
to extreme poverty by <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ffire, shipwracke, or loss of
goods.</q> And having once obtained possession of one
of the twenty one-roomed tenements, he was kept in
the straight and thorny path by pains and penalties
such as no self-respecting pensioner in these days
would submit to for a moment.  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">We ordaine,</q> for
instance, says the rule, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">that each one shall labour
daily in the working days according to their abilities
of body, and those not otherwise set to work shall be
required by any resident of Westminster, and put to
doe such labour as they may or can doe and shall
be offered within one penny by the daye</q>-subject
to severe penalties if they refused.  Penalties, too,
were strictly enforced for <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">frequenting tippling
houses;</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">railing or using uncharitable speech one
against the other;</q> and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">swearing any manner of
blasphemous or unlawful oath.</q>







<pb n=116>







  <p>The diction is not always of the clearest in these
old regulations; but it is evident from these quotations that the life of the pensioners was not
altogether merry. Not only were they to lead a godly,
righteous, and sober life, and be at the beck and call
of any resident of Westminster, at the astonishing
remuneration of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">within a penny</q> a day, but they
were also to take turns at night watching, after their
enforced daily labour was over ; for another regulation reads: -- <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">We ordaine that every evening
after prayer the warden one week and subwarden another week by turns shall take    the
handbell delivered to them, and shall by turn
ring it to prayer next day; and then also shall each
one take heed to their fire and candle, and that
he or she whose turn it is to keep the bell shall, for
that night also, watch till twelve of the clock at night,
and in that while once or twice walk about the court
of the hospital, and that noe harm doe happen by
negligent keening of fire or candle.</q> Rather a rough
time certainly for octogenarians, even though <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">honest
and godly poor, especially those lamed or maymed by
sickness or service of the Prince.</q>
   <p>It must, of course, be borne in mind that the present building was not in any part the original
 <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">hospitall.</q> The first one lasted until the time of
 Queen Anne, in whose reign the initial Tudor building
 was pulled down. It was, however, the present one in
 which, according to Walcot, Mrs Windymere, cousin
 of Queen Mary, consort of William  III., and also
 cousin of Queen Anne, died in one of the lowly one-
 roomed dwellings in <datestruct value="1772-01-"><month>January</month>, <year>1772</year></datestruct>, though that
 point seems to have been lost sight of by the advocates




<pb n=117>



of its preservation. In its early days, no doubt, it
was a decidedly picturesque addition to Old Palmer's
Village, as the then rural district in which it stood
appears to have been called. It is even now a
pleasant little oasis in a desert of brick and mortar,
the trim greensward, seen though a fairly handsome
grille, and the picturesque clock tower making
pleasant features in its appearance. But there is
only too much reason to fear that its sanitary
condition is exceedingly bad, and that it deserves the
epithets such as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">a pile of crazy buildings,</q> and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">an
old ramshackle pile of decayed buildings</q> which
have been showered upon it.  It is a pity to
lose so unique an example of architecture, surrounded with such curious associations; but, on
the other hand, it is impossible to lose sight
of the fact that at present the place is in such
a condition that it is of necessity half empty; the
governors have lost a large part of their funds and
cannot afford to put the present tenements-very
inadequate for human occupation as anyone may see
-into proper repair; while-and this seems the
great argument-the site by the happy accident of its
position is of such value that it can be sold for a sum
that will enable the governors to build a much more
suitable place, and carry out far more satisfactorily
the benevolent intentions of the founder.

<HEAD>The Cathedral of the East.</HEAD>
  <p>Round about the Victoria Docks, in that unsavoury
part of the metropolis which Dickens called <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">London
over the Border,</q> the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Cathedral of the East</q> rears
a stately presence in the midst of surroundings which
for one dead level of squalor, poverty, and wretchedness, cannot be equalled in any other part of London.
It is just midway between Canning Town and Tidal
Basin, at the rear of the great ironworks on the shores
of Bow Creek.   The smoke from the ironworks
mingles with the acidiferous fumes from the many
chemical works on Bugsby Marshes, when the wind
blows from over the river. And when the breeze
comes over Plaistow Marshes, which lie beyond
Cherry Island and Hallville, in the rear, it brings
damp mists and unpleasant exhalations from that
dismal and often putrid swamp. Time was, and not
many years ago, when all this region was marsh land,
impassable not only because of the water that always
lay there, but because of the slime which caught the
unwary pedestrian fast by the ankles in a sort of
quick-sand of greasy, tenacious mud.  But the jerrybuilder came some years ago, and, beginning at the
river bank, where there was something solid and substantial to start upon, has been gradually damming
back the water, and, by a process of propping one
house up by means of another, has run streets and
roads of curious geometric design into and upon the









<pb n=119>



marsh land, so that when you go up one street you
come upon acres of mud and slime, and to get to the
next street, a stone's throw away, you have to return
and go round by the way by which you started.
  <p>So it has come about that here and there are
these little thickly populated townships, of which
the district around St. Luke's Church is one. The
salient feature of them, and of this one in particular,
is that everybody, save the parson, is of one class of
life. Nobody will live there who can afford to live
anywhere else; and no one-even the poorest--lives
there long. There are absolutely no gradations in
society at all. Even the working man, if he has
regular employment, lives elsewhere; for it is not
only that the neighbourhood is squalid, and the
neighbours of the least reputable, but the air is full of
noxious fumes; it is damp and agueish, vegetation of
the hardiest kind refuses to grow, and life generally is
at its lowest level. Consequently there is nothing but
a floating population. People come down to the
docks to find work, and linger in the neighbourhood a
few weeks or months. But, though the whole populalation is changed every two or three months, it is
always the same kind of people who come to take the
places of those who go away-rough, wild, and reckless; seemingly hopeless of improvement either
morally, socially, or physically.
  <p>In this neighbourhood the Rev. J. C. Buckley, Vicar
of St. Luke's Church, carries on a work compared to
which missionary enterprise in foreign lands must be
pleasant and congenial employment. In his case the
work is the more disheartening because he can bring
no prolonged influence to bear upon those coming





<pb n=120>
under his care. It is a case of sowing the seed that
the harvest may be reaped elsewhere under happier
conditions. Yet here a work is being carried on, for
which it would be difficult to find a parallel. The
Church, which has been christened <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Cathedral
of the East,</q> because it is of imposing cathedral-
like structure, is the parent of numerous smaller
churches or mission houses, which seem to crop
up in every other street. Looking at the interior
and exterior magnificence of the mother Church,
with its artistic statuary, its fine stained glass
windows on every side, its wealth of hammered
iron work - in itself an exhibition of art - its
noble proportions in the perpendicular style, and,
above all, its state of wonderful cleanliness and
good repair, one cannot but feel at first that
it is all sadly out of place.   Surely all this
grandeur, coupled with music that seems only fitted
for educated tastes, would be more in keeping with
the West-end than the east. But Mr Buckley argues
otherwise ; and  the  success that attends  his
endeavours seems to show that he is right. His idea
has been to make at least one bright spot in the
wilderness in which circumstances have placed him.
The new comers are attracted to it, but from a sight-
seeing point of view. They come and are impressed
by what they see and hear. The contrast is so great
from anything they have ever seen, and they are so
welcomed that they come again, cleaner and tidier
than before. Hence the Church is full every Sunday,
and despite the uncongeniality of the surroundings,
heartier and better conducted services it would be
difficult to find.









<pb n=121>



  <p>This much is apparent to the most casual observer,
but a little inquiry shows still more remarkable features
in connection with our Eastern Cathedral. I called on
the Vicar, and found him at the Vicarage, which is a
roomy building at the rear of the Church, standing in a
large vacant space of ground. Somewhat surprised
that this should bear the aspect of a wilderness, I was
informed that it was useless to attempt anything, for
not only was the atmosphere so saturated with
poisonous emanations from the chemical works, but
the predatory instincts of the neighbourood are
unconquerable, while offerings of dead cats and refuse
thrown over the walls necessitate that each morning
a man shall go round with a barrow and make the
grounds tolerable for the day. This naturally led to
some conversation as to the character of the neighbourhood, and even the Vicar, who was ready to take
a roseate view of things, spoke almost in a despairing
voice; for not only does the playfulness of the hobble-
dehoys take this form, but broken windows are of
common occurrence, and street fights and midnight
raids form part of the daily life of the people. Among
this rowdy element the Vicar is the only peacemaker,
the police being in too hopeless a minority to do much
good. But though he stops fights, and marches
boldly up to the most brutal to succour some helpless
victim, he passes unscathed where a policeman would
be brutally ill-used, for bad as the general nature of
the mass of the people is, they have a certain respect
-perhaps, in many cases, little more than cupboard
love-for the clergyman who is always at their beck
and call, and who is always their friend in need. The
worst of them will not die, or see one of their kind






<pb n=122>







die, without the attendance of the clergyman, and, as
the Church of England is the only religious body
attempting to live among or reach these people, the
Vicar is, more or less, constantly in request. All this
tends to emphasise the other side of the picture. For
the dark cloud has its silver lining even here. Among
the vast majority there is a minority brought under
the influence of the Church. Small guilds have been
formed which have for their object the encouragement
of personal efforts. One, for instance, undertakes the
repair of everything in the church or mission-rooms.
The materials are bought, but the labour is given
cheerfully; and every night industrious men are to be
seen at work, some painting or gilding, some carpentering, and others attending the gas fittings. Then
every Tuesday morning a procession of women may
be seen going to the Church with their buckets and
brushes. Soft soap is supplied, and they clean the
whole place under the guidance of the Vicar's wife.
This is the explanation of the good order and cleanliness which prevails in the church, and it is the more
remarkable considering the nature of the place in
which it is situated.
  <p>A walk with the Vicar round the parish emphasised
his description of the people with whom he had to
deal. There was at that moment a fight going on at
a street corner. The signs of drunkenness were at
this early hour apparent.  The parish is full of
drunkenness, and this is one of the greatest hindrances
to social improvement. Every idea of the mass of
the people is material; so hard is the struggle
for existence that the spiritual is lost sight of. The
houses in front, being mostly of recent construction,









<pb n=123>



have a fair exterior, but the interior is appalling.
Families are crowded into single rooms of the smallest
dimensions, often destitute of furniture or domestic
comfort. Contrasted with these, the neatly furnished
little mission-rooms look cosy, and serve to attract
youths and others from the streets at night. There is
also a large and well-arranged club. Just on the outskirts of the streets, and on the edge of the marsh, a
site is marked out for another Church. It is on the
edge of a dismal swamp, but all around houses are
being built, apparently without any substantial
foundations, showing how rapidly the place is extending. Over the marsh could be seen, dimly looming
through the mist, the outline of the Church of the
neighbouring parish. Lying between was a veritable
bog. Even what was supposed to be a roadway was
so thick with mud that it was difficult to avoid
leaving one's boots behind, as a curate of Mr. Buckley
did on one occasion, having to walk home in his
stockings. Everything around could only be fittingly
characterised in the picturesque language of Mr
Mantalini. Moisture and unpleasantness, poverty and
wretchedness everywhere, save in the schools, where
the children, thanks to Mr. Buckley's co-workers, were
clean and tidy; dirt and despair everywhere save in
the Church, the mission-rooms, and the club. It was
impossible to leave the district without being
impressed by the success which has attended efforts
which would have seemed to ordinary eyes entirely
hopeless and disheartening.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=23>



<HEAD>At the Soane Museum.</HEAD>



  <p><q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">I don't intend to vegetate here,</q> remarked Mr G.
H. Birch, F.S.A., the well-known architect.  He was
seated in that quaintly-arranged and comfortably-
furnished room which the late Sir John Soane used as
a breakfast room, and in which some of his choicest
relics are stored. There was the ruddy glow of health
upon his cheeks, for Mr. Birch is in the prime of life,
and his remark was in reply to a suggestion of
strangeness that he should settle down so early in
life to a quiet old age as a curator even of so curious
and fascinating a collection as that in Lincoln's Inn,
Fields. A curatorship of this class is generally
regarded as a sort of pension, but Mr. Birch declared
that he declined to accept it in any such spirit.  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">I
am going to make it of interest to everyone,</q> and he
proceeded to show how he should do so.
  <p>First, it must be remarked how few people know
much of the Soane Museum.   To the majority it is
a strangeley-built house,overcrowded with curios of the
description usually found nowhere else, a collection
worthy of the closest study. But it is improbable that
any living person knows thoroughly what the place
contains. Though its former curators have been men
of culture, and of much enthusiasm with regard to the
relics placed under their charge, it is doubtful whether
even they have ever made themselves thoroughly
acquainted with the contents of the place.  And this,











<pb n=125>



not because of any want of diligence on their part.
The fact is that Sir John Soane had a sort of mania
for two things.  One was the use of looking glass in
every possible corner, and in the most unexpected
places, and the second was for making cupboards,
folding doors for pictures, and hiding-places on a sort
of secret panel arrangement of his own.  The former
gives the place a weird aspect.  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It is a good thing
I am not a nervous man,</q> Mr. Birch said; <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">but I
must confess when I came here I was often startled by
seeing my own reflection-which in the dusk I did
not recognise-advancing towards me from out of odd
nooks and crevices. At times the effect was ghostly,
but I am getting used to it.</q>  By the second feature
of the place, Sir John Soane made the house hold
three or four times its apparent capacity, and things
are so crowded together that constant discoveries are
being made of articles of the greatest possible interest.
There are few men, if any at all, possessing such a
knowledge of everything valuable that they would be
capable of appreciating the worth of all the treasures.
To do so, a man would have to be a bibliophile, an
art connoisseur, an architect, a draughtsman, an
Egyptologist, and a archaeologist, not to mention
other less important qualifications, for such a wide
range of curiosities and specimens-covering as it
does every art and almost every science-has probably never before been collected under one roof.
This is why many valuable things are hidden away
unappreciated.
  <p>There are many secret places that have rarely been
opened, many nests of drawers of which the keys
have been lost, cupboards that may simply have

<pb n=126>







skeletons in them.  To open these hidden stores of
wealth, to make fresh discoveries, and to make them
available to the public is one of Mr. Birch's ideas.
He has not been there long, but he has already made
one discovery on which he prides himself. Taking a
small key from his pocket, he crossed over to the
other side of the fireplace, to where the wall was
panelled with wood. There seemed no hiding-place
there, and no room for one, but, inserting the key in
a concealed keyhole, he opened a narrow doorway,
through which he could just pass.  Beyond was a
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">strong room,</q> and from this he returned with a
paper-covered book, that looked as though it might
have been a copy-book of a child of Brobdingnag.
It was, however, a book in whichwere designs of
Vanbrugh, an original account book of Blenheim
Palace, and original drawings by Thorpe, an architect
of the reign of James I.-a perfect mine of interest
to architects. With reverential care Mr. Birch displayed its contents, and then gathered up his treasure
and carried it carefully back to its hiding-place. Other
panels he opened in this room, other unsuspected
bookcases he revealed, full of old books, many of
which doubtless are of considerable value, but which
the casual visitor does not deign to notice.
  <p>And in respect to cupboards, it must not be forgotten that in his will Sir John specified two, which
were found carefully locked ; one of which was not
to be opened until 50 years after his death, and the
other of which was to remain closed for 75 years.
As Sir John died in <datestruct value="1837--"><year>1837</year></datestruct>, the first cupboard has been
opened.  The result, Mr. Birch remarked, has never
been made public; but as a matter of fact, the cubboard










<pb n=127>



board was found nearly empty. The most interesting
thing found was a letter to Turner enclosing a cheque
for &pound;500. which had never been posted. The letter-
and it possesses interest from the fact that it has never
before been published, was as follows:-<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Dear
Turner,-I saw that drawing last night, and admired
it very much. And if you think the accompanying
cheque in any way represents the value of it, pray let
me have the picture.  Yours, &amp;c., John Soane.</q>
Whether the other cupboard will reveal anything of
greater value remains to be seen.
  <p>A walk round the Museum showed that Mr. Birch
was wonderfully well informed as to its contents, as
well as well versed in its intricate geography.
In the dining room and library he pointed to the
capacious and crowded bookshelves on the walls, and
in the projecting piers dividing the rooms, and in the
window recessess, where one usually finds shutters,
and announced his determination of exploring these
shelves and examining each book-a truly Herculean
task, which will certainly tax his patience and perseverence. This is perhaps one of the best-known parts
of the museum, and there is no necessity to linger
over the pictures which cover the vermillion-painted
walls, the curios with which it is filled, and the strange
furniture crumbling to pieces with old age. In every
other part of the museum he indicated cabinets and
places to be explored, while in the oddest possible
spots he showed how the space had been made the
most of. Nowhere, of course, is this more noticeable
than in the picture room, which has the unique series
of movable planes, shown to every visitor, which
makes a room 13 feet by 12 equal in picture-hanging







<pb n=128>







space to a gallery 45 feet long by 20 feet broad. But
this is by no means the only instance, and visitors
who have the time and inclination may find many
others.
  <p>The pictures by Hogarth, <name>The Election</name> and
<name>The Rake's Progress,</name> everyone knows; and it is
noticeable how much better preserved these are here
than those in the National Gallery. The Canalettos
also are to everyone's taste, but there is one particular
feature of the art portion of the Museum which no
doubt strikes some visitors. It is that one sees here
pictures by artists long since dead and forgotten, and
whose works are never seen elsewhere. It is evident
that Sir John was an art critic of the broadest possible
views, and that, added to the catholicity of his taste,
was a desire to perpetuate the worth of many neglected men. Who now remembers George Jones,
Danby, Owen, Jackson, Howard, or Bird? Yet here
are pictures by each and all of them, which anyone
who has patience to find them out will view with
admiration. The ordinary visitor, when he has gazed
at the Turners, the Lawrences, the Ruydaels, Raffaels,
Reynolds, Rubens, Tintorettos, the Zuccharellis, and
the Watteaus, has little disposition to linger over the
mass of paintings and drawings of peculiarly architectural merit, and gives but a passing glance of
astonishment at the numerous designs of buildings which Sir
John Soane proposed to build in various parts of
London. One of these, his great design for a Royal
Palace in the Green Park, might have been utilised
had George IV. lived; but after his death more
economical notions prevailed; Buckingham Palace
became a Royal residence, and was subsequently
enlarged by the Prince Consort. There is something









<pb n=129>



pathetic in these long rows of grand edifices which Sir
John found time to draw-the Royal palaces, the
design for a new House of Lords, the new Houses of
Parliament, and Courts of Judicature, a triumphal
bridge, and churches innumerable, which never got
further than a paper existence, and which are now
but a monument to the untiring industry of the man.
  <p>Walking through the corridors, the students' rooms,
the monk's parlour, the catacombs, the sepulchral
chamber, and the crypt, Mr Birch showed that he is
full of schemes for popularising the museum, and
making it of greater use. At present the prominent
features of the place only are known, and those not
so widely as they should be. What is wanted is that
some knowledge of its hidden treasure should be
spread abroad. The museum is now more readily
accessible to the public than it used to be. Formerly
it was only opened on two days in the week. Now,
from March to August inclusive, it is open to the
public four days in the week, the other days being
reserved for students, of whom there is an increasing
number.


<pb n=130>
<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=24>
<HEAD>The Nation's Newspapers.</HEAD>
  <p>It is generally known that at the British Museum
is preserved a copy of every newspaper published in
the United Kingdom, and that the collection of early
newspapers is unique, having never suffered by fire or
accident. But probably few people have ever thought
of, much less realised, the immense amount of labour
involved in keeping up the collection, in binding,
classifying, and preserving the papers ready for use
in the newspaper reference room. Anyone who has
had occasion to consult the newspaper files knows
how simple it is. He walks into a comfortable room,
and fills up a form with the name and date of the
journal he wishes to consult. It may be one of the
earliest papers published, or a century or half a century old, or it may be one of recent issue, but in any
case it is placed before him in a few minutes, and he
is free to pore over its contents as long as he likes.
When he has done with it, back it goes to the catacombs below, where are miles upon miles of passages
in which the newspapers are kept.
  <p>It is interesting to walk through these catacombs,
and see the arrangements which render this result
possible. The department is in charge of Mr. W.
Vincent, and under his interesting pilotage I had
recently an opportunity of making an acquaintance
with the mysteries of the newspaper department, the
inner working of which, as is the case with every










<pb n=131>



other department of the Bloomsbury Institution, is
carefully hidden from the public eye. Descending a
spiral staircase to the nethermost basement, one of
the huge sacks was seen in which newspapers are
brought every morning from the Post Office. There
is at least one sack full every morning; on Mondays
and Saturdays two and sometimes three; while all
day long by every delivery other smaller quantities
are dribbling in. Mr Vincent explains, as we go
along, that last year the different provincial newspapers sending copies numbered 1,400, those
published in London numbered 659, Scotland contributing
232, and Ireland 195, making a grand total of 2,846
journals sending copies of each issue, or 170,618 single
number; the average received per day being 546
papers. These are sorted, folded, and registered; and
a watch has to be kept that every paper comes that
ought to come. Should any fail to arrive, the publisher has to be written to, and, if necessary, threatened
with pains and penalties; and so carefully is all this
done that during a period of many years there are
scarcely half-a-dozen missing papers.
  <p>It should be explained here that the British Museum
authorities had statutory right under the Copyright
Act to a copy of every newspaper published in the
United Kingdom. This was not always the case.
Originally, of course, newspapers existed under great
difficulties, and not much was done in publishing them
until the abolition of the Censorship of the Press in
<datestruct value="1695--"><year>1695</year></datestruct>. They then grew so rapidly that the Chancellor
of the Exchequer of the day saw in them a means of
revenue, and a stamp duty was imposed in <datestruct value="1711--"><year>1711</year></datestruct>.
This stamp duty, together with the duty on advertisements,






<pb n=132>







rendered it necessary for copies of the
papers to be sent to Somerset House, where either
by accident or design they accumulated for some
years. It then occurred to some one that they would
be a valuable record of events, so they were handed
over from Somerset House to the British Museum,
where they became part of the Library. During the
whole of the time the stamp duty was exacted this
course was followed, and the collection of newspapers
by the time the stamp duty was abolished had become
very considerable. Its value had also become so evident that the Museum authorities felt bound to
continue the collection.  They were, however, in a
dilemma, for newspapers had multiplied so rapidly, in
spite of the stamp duty, that it was no light task.
Mr. Lethbridge, of the firm of Messrs W. H. Smith
and Sons, came to the rescue, and undertook the duty
for a year. By that time the Copyright Office had
been started (<datestruct value="1873--"><year>1873</year></datestruct>), and with the statutory power
now possessed a new department was initiated at the
Museum. Mr. Vincent soon aftarwards took charge
of it, and it has grown to its present gigantic proportions under his supervision.
  <p>By this time we are walking along long passages
lined with bulky volumes, edgewise, from floor to
ceiling, or rather what would be the ceiling if there
were one, for these storage places are on a curious
principle. The passages-they are not rooms-are
one above the other, three deep, and instead of
intervening floorings there are iron gratings, so that
the light of day comes though the roof and finds its
way down to the basement. It is curious to look up
from the ground floor at the upper storeys, walled







<pb n=133>



with books, and listen to the patter of the feet of the
assistants, who are constantly moving about, fetching
or returning books. Commenting on the seeming
strangeness of the arrangement, Mr Vincent explains
that it is the safeguard of the place. Everything is
fireproof, and there is absolutely no artificial lighting,
except here and there at cross passages an incandescent light. The only light used is the light of day,
and the only heat is from underground hot water
pipes, fed by engines which are outside the building.
On a foggy day the place is in darkness, and it is
impossible to get any books. But if for any purpose it is
necessary to penetrate into the labyrinth of passages,
the only light allowed is a lamp carefully locked up
with a Chubb's lock, which is lighted and locked by
the Superintendent. To these safeguards is attributed
the fact that the library has escaped catastrophe
from fire. Only once has there been the least danger.
That was some twenty-nine years ago, when a fire
occurred in the bookbinder's shop, and some half
dozen books were destroyed and others injured.
  <p>All the bookbinding is done on the premises, and,
with so many newspapers to be bound, there is quite
a glut of binding. The newspapers accumulate so
fast that it is impossible to keep pace with the work,
and one sees huge bundles of papers stored away in
odd corners. The system pursued is that papers, as
they arrive, are placed in pigeon holes until a
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bindable</q> quantity is accumulated. They are tied up
in bundles, and, having been bound, are transferred to
the permanent shelves, of which there are more miles
than one would care to measure. It is one of the
statistical facts about the Museum, which is to be
accepted as undoubted, that there are over thirty-






<pb n=134>







three miles of shelving stored with books. Of those
thirty-three miles a very large proportion is occupied
with newspapers, which are so rapidly overflowing the
accommodation provided, that an application for more
room is now under the consideration of the authorities.
After walking through the labyrinth of passages and
noting the extra space filled each year one can realise
that the future prospect is presenting a grand problem
to the authorities.
  <p>One of the most interesting things in connection
with this department is to note the growth, not only
of the newspaper press as a whole, but of individual
papers, from small and curiously printed sheets-
note-paper size-to the great broadsides now in use.
Some of the earlier ones are very curious. These, of
course, have been either bought or presented to the
Museum, because there was no systematic collection
in the early days of newspapers.  One extremely
interesting lot is known as the Burney collection,
which was bequeathed to the Museum by the late
Dr. Burney. These include copies of the <title lang=la>Mercurius
Publicus</title> and the <title lang=la>Mercurius Politicus</title>, in which some
of the most important evens in history are chronicled.

  <p>It only remains to state, for the information of those
unacquainted with the routine of the newspaper
department, that there is a special room for reference
to newspapers, parliamentary publications, voters'
lists, and directories, available to those possessing
tickets of admission to the reading-room. The chief
restriction is that access is allowed to bound volumes
only. Originally there was no restriction of this kind,
and the newspaper reference-room degenerated into a
reading-room, cases being known of weekly and daily
periodicals being asked for within an hour or two
of their publication. As it was never intended to be
a reading-room, this rule was adopted, but in cases
where special reason can be shown access is allowed,
on application to the library superintendent, to
unbound papers. Mention has been made of voters'
lists, and it may not be generally known that copies
are received of voters' lists from all parts of the
country At first thought it might not be supposed
that they are worth storage room, but M. Vincent tells
a story which illustrates their utility. One day he
met a solicitor whom he knew, and who said he was
much bothered about a case he had coming on, in
which the question arose whether his client or the
other man occupied a certain house some years before.
M. Vincent at once referred him to the collection of
voters' lists, and by that means he was able to show
conclusively that his client was the tenant of the
premises, thus winning a case the issue of which would
otherwise have been very doubtful.

<HEAD>Curiosities of Coinage.</HEAD>

  <p>Two circumstances happened a couple of years ago
which called attention to our coins and coinage.
The new designs for the coinage of this country were
thrown open to inspection at the Mint, and it was
announced that Professor Poole, who had been
Keeper of Coins at the British Museum, was vacating
that position.  The professor had so close an
acquaintance with the ancient and modern coinage
of the world that this seemed a specially fitting
opportunity to procure from him a few of the results
of his researches, with sone other curious points
attaching to coins and their history. I found the
Professor-who died some two years later-at home at
his official residence in the Museum quadrangle, and
was readily granted an interview in the large library,
the walls of which are covered with books on
numismatics, including the catalogues - quite a
library in themselves-of the national collection issued
while Professor Poole had held the office of Keeper
of Coins. It seemed difficult to believe that the
Professor had spent forty years in the service of his
country, so well did he look, and so energetic was he in
lecturing on his favourite study. Yet that was the fact.
In <datestruct value="1842--"><year>1842</year></datestruct> he was appointed to the old department of
antiquities, and when this was divided, he remained in
charge of the coins, first as assistant keeper, and since
<datestruct value="1870--"><year>1870</year></datestruct> in the more responsible position.





<pb n=137>



  <p>The collection of coins at the Museum had therefore
grown up almost entirely under Professor Poole's
care-for before it became a separate department the
collection was a very miscellaneous one indeed-and
he had much to say of its continual enrichment, the
care required to procure unique specimens, and the
difficulty of doing this in a department under
Government, where funds are sometimes ample and
sometimes very scarce. But important gifts have
been made from time to time; and the collection is
now an exceedingly good one, in which the Professor
took a great deal of pride. If he had one regret more
than another, it was that the Museum missed what was
undoubtedly the rarest coin in the world-an
enormous gold coin of Eucratides, King of Bactria,
about three inches in diameter, which was sold for
&pound;1,200 to the French Emperor-it is now in the
<foreign lang=fr>Bibliotheque Nationale</foreign>-after the authorities here had
offered &pound;1,000 for it. The gem of our collection,
from the point of view of rarity, is a five-shilling piece
of the Old Pretender, issued under the style of James
III., being the only one known. There is a curious
history attaching to this. It belonged to a certain
General Yorke-Moore, who brought it to the Museum
when Mr Hawkins was keeper of antiquities, and said
that he was going to take it out to the Crimea. Mr
Hawkins was so angry to think that such a risk should
be run with so rare a coin that he threw it back to the
General, and it fell to the floor. General Moore
picked it up and went away with it, taking it with
him as a sort of talisman to the Crimea. After the
General's death it was puschased for the Museum for
&pound;250, which is about the largest sum the Museum






<pb n=138>







authorities have ever given for a single coin. The
next largest price they have paid was &pound;240 for a coin
of Cleopatra of Syria, which is also unique, and was
bought at the Northwick sale.
  <p>The mention of these prices naturally brought up
the question of how price is fixed, and how he would
arrive at a price to offer for a rare coin. The Professor
answered that for the better known coins there is a
sort of fixed market price, which is increased or
decreased by the exigences of demand and supply.
But when, as in the case of the Eucratides coin, he
might have to make an offer for an unique gold coin,
he arrived at the value by considering what would be
the value of a gem of that size, and then dividing the
amount by four; the value of the gem being about four
times that of gold. It sometimes happens, however,that
price and present value are materially affected by an
amateur collector with abundant funds at his disposal.
As an instance, he mentioned that Mr Wigan-
whose collection was one of world-wide celebrity, and
who was a man of extraordinary taste and judgment
-raised the price of the Roman large brass coins to
&pound;40. As soon as he was dead the price fell to &pound;5, at
which they have since remained. On the other hand
there was a distinguished collector who bought almost
entirely on borrowed money, and formed a very fine
collection. When it came to be sold there was a large
profit after the debt and interest had been paid off.
To do that, of course, required immense caution, and
the advice which Mr. Poole gave the intending
collectors was to take up a special branch. Acting on
this advise, Dr. Hermann Webber has accumulated a
fine collection of Greek coins, which is only rivalled






<pb n=139>



by that of Canon Greenwell, of Durham, the famous
archaeologist. It is also necessary to bear in mind
that coins are not valuable merely because of their
age. What is wanted is a good specimen from a good
condition of the die, bearing in mind, especially with
regard to Roman coins, that the Romans used up one
die before they got a new one, so that their coins
varied much as regards condition, even from the first.
  <p>The great time of the spread of coinage was in the
fifth century B.C., but the beauty and historical
importance of coins dates from only about 400 B.C.
The Romans were great coiners, and their coins are
practically a chronicle. They always kept the standard good, and the metal pure ; the Roman coins
were practically what it was intended the Queen
Anne's farthings should be. These farthings have a
fabulous reputation for value, but really, Professor
Poole declared, they are not valuable, though an
interesting class as bearing a number of subjects
allegorically treated.  The Romans went further.
They represented on their coins all the events of the
year by an immediate issue of bronze coins and, in a
lesser degree, of gold and silver, so that a man of the
time of Hadrian going to market and looking at his
change would see where the Emperor was and what
was going on. The Professor declared that there is
no better representation of the course of Roman
history than a full collection of coins. It is remarkable, too, that modern medallists have entirely failed
to produce such good coins and medals, as these
which were the work of inferior Roman artists.
Another curious fact about coinage is that Philip II.
discovered a gold mine near Philippi, and issued a





<pb n=140>







coin that became popular throughout the world. The
earliest British coins are debased Philips-lower in
weight and of ruder type, but at the same time really
representing Philip's money.  In the times of the
Saxons, these coins gave place to silver pennies-
very small thin silver coins, weighing 24 grains, being
used. From that time to Edward III. there was no
marked improvement in our money. That monarch
issued the noble or 6s. 8d. in gold; and then there
was little change until the time of Elizabeth, when
practically modern coinage begins.  The reign of
Charles I. in the time of the great rebellion was
marked by an enormous issue of hastily struck pieces
with a view of providing payment for troops. It was
in this era that not only crowns and ten shilling
pieces but pounds were struck in silver-coins with
little else but their weight and actual value to recommend them. The Oxford crown is memorable for
bearing on it a picture of the City of Oxford, in
which the chief buildings are clearly recognisable
under the figure of the King on horseback. In the
meantime foreign nations had advanced rather more
rapidly than we did, and the whole currency of the
middle ages presents very beautiful coins, though
they were never equal in artistic merit to the Greek.
  <p>In conclusion the Professor pointed out that the
collection at the Museum is eminently practical and
confined to standard coins. It is devoid, therefore,
of many of the curious features which characterise
some private collections-the base coins bearing a
false value, leaves of prayer books roughly stamped,
pieces of metal and other things mace to do duty as
coins in times of war. There are a few <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">mules,</q> or





<pb n=141>
coins that have two obverses or two reverses; and
there are some coins called <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Charon money.</q> taken
from the mouths of Greek skeletons, where it was
fixed between the teeth to pay Charon for the passage
across the Styx; but there is no effort to secure mere
curiosities that have no bearing on the legitimate
coinage of the country to which they belong. As a
national collection should, it illustrates the growth of
coinage from the earliest days; and, thanks largely to
Professor Poole's zeal, study, and care, is one worthy
of the institution in which it finds so prominent a
place.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=26>
<HEAD>The National Stamp Collection.</HEAD>

  <p>It is pretty generally known that some time ago the
late Mr. T. R. Tapling, M.P., bequeathed to the nation
his collection of postage stamps, which is believed to
be the largest in the world, and has only one competitor in size and importance, namely, that of Herr
von Ferrary, of Paris. The bequest was accepted by
the authorities of the British Museum, who recognising
the widespread and rapidly-growing interest taken in
philately, resolved to make the collection accessible to
the public. In pursuance of this design, they have
been at considerable pains to have the stamps,
envelopes, &amp;c., properly arranged. For some months
this has been in progress, the services of Mr. E. D.
Bacon, of the Philatelic Society of London, having
been procured for the purpose; and various instal-
ments have been on view at the Museum.
  <p>It is not unnatural that the action of the authorities
of the Museum should have excited a good deal of
interest, perhaps a little apprehension, in the minds of
collectors and dealers. The former at once wanted
to know if the nation was going to set up stamp-
collecting on a gigantic scale, and completely overshadow all possible individual efforts. The latter, of
course, are interested to know the extent to which the
authorities are going to boom philately. With a view
to obtaining some information on these and other
points which might be generally interesting, I called









<pb n=143>



at the Museum, and was accorded an interview with
Dr. Garnett, the Keeper of Printed Books, in whose
department, and under whose charge, the collection
has been placed. Dr. Garnett, as everyone knows,
has been in the Printed Book Department since <datestruct value="1851--"><year>1851</year></datestruct>,
first as Assistant, then as Assistant-Keeper, and finally
as Keeper. Though taking an active part in the
duties of the department, and having effected very
great improvements in the Library, he has found time
to contribute largely to periodical literature, and to
publish many books. His forty-two years' service at
the Museum have in no way impaired his vigour; and
though he at once admitted that he had not been
smitten with the philately mania, he at once showed
that, having undertaken the charge of the Tapling
collection, he had made himself thoroughly acquainted
with the details of the new task that has been imposed
upon him.
  <p>Dr. Garnett was not difficult of access, from the
point of view of his willingness to be found; but it
was not easy to find him. The Library of the Museum
is peculiarly labyrinthine. On asking for Dr. Garnett,
you are informed that he is to be found in the King's
Library, at No. 121, with the added injunction, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Please
ring the bell and wait.</q> Well, you walk into the
library and find all the walls hidden by books-the
bookshelves being particularly solid and substantial.
There are cases around, with precious contents; and
among them the cases with the Tapling Stamps are
seen. Two new cases have been made specially for
the purpose, and the stamps are admirably arranged.
There are no signs of a doorway, but, looking around
rather helplessly, one sees on the cornice above the





<pb n=144>







bookshelves certain numbers very close together.
Yes, there is No. 121, in gilt numerals, some fifteen or
twenty feet from the ground, but underneath are continuous bookshelves running round the room. And,
then, as you begin to comprehend the details, a little
push-button is seen on one of the shelves. That must
be the bell. On pushing the button you hear a distant
tinkling of a bell, of rather <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ghostly sound, as though
it came from a distant tomb.</q> Then the book-shelves
are seen suddenly to give way; you step back, and,
before your amazement has subsided, you are standing
in front of an assistant, who is in a passage burrowing
through the wall and bookcase, and you are invited
inside. Through the passage, and by way of an outer
office, turning abruptly to the left, you find you rself
in a cosy room lined with books, and pleasantly received by Dr. Garnett, but still feeling that you have
had a curious experience.
  <p>In the course of conversation, Dr. Garnett said it is
quite true that the collection had been valued at
&pound;50,000. It seemed a large sum, he admitted, but the
collection includes not only stamps, but post cards,
envelopes, telegraph forms, &amp;c., many of which are
unique. They had been placed in the printed book
department, though not strictly belonging to printed
books, because they are printed matter, and can be
best displayed in the Library.  There are other
curiosities of printing under his charge, such as a
Chinese bank note printed hundreds of years before
bank notes were <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">invented</q> in Europe, so that it was
not out of place for the stamps to be placed here. It
also seems to have been forgotten that the Museum is
already in possession of a collection of stamps, a










<pb n=145>



gentleman named Hase having some two or three
years ago presented to the Museum a small lot as the
nucleus of a collection which he urged the authorities
to make. These were not of sufficient importance to
be displayed in cases, but they had been arranged in
an album, and can be seen by anyone desiring to do
so. This naturally brought up the question, do the
authorities intend, now that they have got so good a
start, to attempt to make a complete collection. To
this Dr. Garnett replied rather emphatically that the
Museum <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">would not probably at any time</q> purchase
stamps, because they did not think it proper employment for their funds. They had not money enough
to buy all the books they wanted, and he considered
that books are of more importance than stamps. But
they would perhaps be enabled to enrich the collection
by exchange, there being a great many duplicates
Nothing was to be done in this way until the arrangement of the collection has been completed, but when
that is done they will be better able to tell what they
will be able to do. And in this respect it was well to
bear in mind that stamps are liable to deterioration
when exposed to view for any length of time. That
consideration makes it impossible for the whole
collection to be shown at once. For the present the
display made will be confined to the two cases already
obtained, but the contents will be changed frequently,
in order to avoid fading of the colours from exposure
to light.
  <p>With regard to the nature of the collection, Dr.
Garnett said it is too early as yet to go into details,
but there are stamps of very great rarity, and consequently of very great value. It is a curious thing with









<pb n=146>







regard to stamps, he remarked, that there is possibly
no other object in which the intrinsic value is so small,
both as regards the material of which it is made, or
the art required to make it. The intrinsic value is out
of all proportion to the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">unearned increment</q> that
became attached to it in consequence of its rarity.
There are rare Mauritius stamps among the collection,
which are valued at about &pound;200. The paper and
paste of which they were made was of infinitesimal
value, and the art expended on them practically nil.
Another case in point is the group of specimens of
the first issue of stamps in Hawaii, among those now
on view. Though only twelve in number they had
been roughly valued at about &pound;800. There are also
equally rare specimens of the early stamps of Buenos
Ayres, and indeed the Tapling collection is specially
rich in first issues. Then again there are not only
specimens of prints from the various dies, but specimens of the various issues showing the various tints
of paper on which the stamps were printed.. Thus
in one instance, now on view, there were seven or
eight specimens showing different tints of paper.
Viewed singly no difference would be noticed, but
when placed close together in line there is a perceptible gamut of colour.
  <p>Those now on view are mostly colonial, including
three-cornered  Newfoundlands,  specimens  from
Hawaii, with the heads of Kamehama I., Elua-
Keneta, and Queen Kapeolani; and early issues of
British North America, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Canada, and Buenos
Ayres. Among the New Brunswick are two specimens of the five per cent. stamp, known as the











<pb n=147>



Connell stamp, having been issued by a postmaster of
that name, who had the temerity to put his own
portrait on the stamp in place of that of the monarch.
The stamps were only on issue for a short period,
being withdrawn by order of Council. Among other
curiosities are the halved stamps of New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward
Island. In order to prevent the necessity of having a
new stamp prepared to meet a reduction of the
postage fee, the public was allowed for a time to cut
existing stamps in half, and use each half. As fresh
selections are placed on view new curiosities will crop
up from time to time, so that the collection will be a
source of perennial interest. In conclusion it may be
added that Dr. Garnett is strongly impressed with the
view that the collection is one which will grow in
value. He also looks forward to the time when, if
the present tendency to unification goes on increasing
in influence, there may be an international series of
stamps. In that case such a collection as this would
be an object of great curiosity to future generations.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=27>
<HEAD>A Chat about Oriental Manuscripts.</HEAD>

  <p>There are certain departments of the British
Museum into the sacred precincts of which the feet
of the profane rarely intrude. One of these is the
department of Oriental Printed Books and MSS.,
where are zealously guarded priceless treasures in the
shape of ancient books and manuscripts. With these
in the mass it is not permitted to anyone to make
acquaintance. A few are exhibited in cases in the
lower halls to stimulate or satisfy the curiosity of the
casual visitor, and students can have others down for
perusal in the students' room. But, far from being a
museum of antiquities open to all, the treasures of the
department are stowed away, with infinite solicitude
for their future welfare, in rooms the very existence of
which is known to few.
  <p>Attention has recently been called to the department by issuing what is called a descriptive list of its
Hebrew and Samaritan contents. Hitherto there has
been no catalogue whatever of these books and manuscripts, and consequently no one but the officials had
any idea of what was stowed away. Students have,
however, something to refer to now, and the issuing
of the list has called attention to the importance of the
collection. With a view to giving some particulars of
the collection, I paid a visit to the museum, and
readily received the permission of Mr. R. K. Douglas,





<pb n=149>



the keeper of this department to make himself
acquainted with its contents and arrangement. The
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">list,</q> it should be said, has been compiled by Mr. G.
Margoliouth, who is a veritable walking encyclopaedia
as regards the books in his charge. He was quite
ready to point out its chief features, and an hour's
conversation with him elicited the facts contained in
this article. The descriptive list, he was careful to
point out, is only a preliminary to a voluminous catalogue, like those of the Syriac and Ethiopic MSS.
which were the work of the late Professor Wright.
When this has been completed, the whole of the ancient
books and manuscripts will have been catalogued,
and students will be able to take the fullest advantage
of them.
  <p>Before proceeding to give an insight into the character of the Hebrew and Samaritan books, it may be
interesting to state that in this room, the Oriental
room as it is called, there are the Syriac library, the
Ethiopic, the Hebrew, and the Persian, besides a number of books from Yemen. The history of some of
these is quite romantic. The Syriac, for instance, came
from the desert of Scete, in Egypt, where they had
been mouldering for years, and were restored with
difficulty. These books and manuscripts were originally written in Egypt, and were then taken to
Mesopotamia, whence they were taken back to Egypt
about the 10th century. At that time the Egyptian
monks knew Syriac, and studied these books, but
gradually they lost their knowledge of the language,
and the writings were stowed away in subterranean
caves and caverns until European scholars ascertained
their existence, and with difficulty obtained possession








<pb n=150>







of them some forty or fifty years ago. The Ethiopic
writings composed the royal library of Magdala, and
were brought to this country by Lord Napier. Other
manuscripts have been obtained from all parts of the
world. Some of the most valuable were obtained
from the unfortunate man Schapira, whose history is
still well remembered. Scarcely is there one of which
the history has not been eventful and curious.
  <p>To deal, however, with the Hebrew Library, which
now, practically for the first time, is open to public
perusal. The library, taking it in the order in which
it appears in the descriptive list, begins with <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Biblical
texts and commentaries</q> in Hebrew and Arabic. A
good many are in Arabic, but written in Hebrew character, so that they rank as Hebrew literature. Next
are the Midrashi, which come in natural sequence to
the Biblical, because they deal chiefly with the
Pentateuch, and give legendary and homiletical explanations. The biggest section of all is that which
deals with the Talmud; and in this and Halakah-
which means <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">law</q>-practically all the Jewish rules of
life are laid down and discussed. As the section
covers a period of two thousand years it is naturally
much the largest in point of size. The first portions
of the Talmud were not written until about the year
<datestruct value="200--"><year>200 A.D.</year></datestruct>, but the sayings thus written down date back
to the time of Maccabeeus, 100 B.C. Many of the
books and writings are of great interest, though in
those of later date the Talmudic writings degenerated
sometimes into puerile discussions which now appear
strange and unmeaning. Next come the liturgies,
which is also a large section, and contains the liturgies
of the synagogue all over the world, including those







<pb n=151>



used in Africa, Italy, Spain, and Yemen. The Yemen
books are specially valued. They have been brought
into Europe within the last forty years, Before that
time very little was known about them. It is by
these liturgies that the Jewish liturgies all over the
world are practically traced from Babylonia in the
10th century, though the earliest are about 2,000 years
old. Many of them are illuminated.
  <p>Then welcome to the Kabbalah, books which treat
of mystic teaching. In the 13th century Moses de Leon
composed in Spain the most famous mystic book of
his age, the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Zoar.</q>  He gave it out that it was
originally composed by a Rabbi who lived in the time
of the Christian era, and a great many people believe
still that that was so. For a long time the Jewish
world was stirred to its foundations by this book, and
the copy here is a favourite book with students. In
the books relating to ethics and philosophy, it is
found that the Jews were entirely disciples of the
Greeks, chiefly through the Arabs. The Arab scholars
and thinkers, from the 9th to the 12th century, based
their philosophical systems chiefly on Aristotle, translating his works into Arabic with commentaries. The
Jews translated these translations into Hebrew. They
also partly translated the commentaries, and wrote
new ones. Here will be found the writings of that
great man Moses Maimonides, who may be called the
Jewish Aristotle-the great Jewish philosopher who
tried to reconcile the Hebrew scriptures with the
Greek philosophy, much in the style of Philo the Jew
in Alexandria a century before the Christian era. It
is this Maimonides about whom there was the famous
saying that from Moses to Moses there was no man

<pb n=152>







like Moses. A later writer, Moses Mendelssohn, was
paid the same compliment.

  <p>Of poetical books the collection is smaller. Some
of them are rather heartrending, describing the
sufferings of the  Jews, their persecutions and
martyrdoms. One of the greatest poetic writers was
Rabbi Jehuda Hallevi  In the 13th and 14th centuries
the Jews had very great poets, the Spanish Jews
being especially famous for their poetry. One of the
greatest of these is Al Hariza, whose works are to be
found preserved here. He was an imitator of the
Arabic poet Hariri, and is considered almost his
equal. He was a secular poet, and did not write
much liturgical poetry. Recently the department has
been enriched by works of the Yemenite poets of the
16th century. There are also specimens of Persian
poetry in Hebrew character, very valuable, because
there is little of it extant in Europe.  Specially should
be mentioned the famous story of Yussuf and
Zulaikha.  The original poem  was by the great
Persian poet Jami. It was translated into Hebrew
character, and a great deal of other matter added to
it. An interesting poet of the middle ages in Italy,
whose writings can also be read here, was Imanuel
ben Solomon. He was an imitator of Dante. It is
abundantly evident that the Jews had a great deal of
poetic talent, but they were kept down by persecution.
When prosecution ceased, their poetic talent had
freer play. Their poetry was also influenced by the
fact that they were kept away from the great world.
They lived in the Ghetto, and their ideas could not
have the same play.






<pb n=153>



  <p>In philology again the Jews did a great deal. The
earliest Hebrew dictionary was composed in the 10th
century. The great Hebrew lexicographer of the
Middle Ages David is Kimchi. His dictionary and
grammar are included in the list; as are also his
commentaries, which, for the Middle Ages, are
singularly free from  puerile interpretations.  As
regards mathematics and astronomy, the writings
show that the Jews were in this, again, disciples of the
Arabs, although there were independent men among
them. Most of the Jewish great men of the Middle
Ages studied astronomy, and many wrote books upon
it. Their great object was not to study it as a science,
but to calculate the calendar, because their feasts
begin with the new moon. Their month was not
fixed by calculations for a long period of years, but
depended on each new moon, for which reason, instead
of keeping one day as a feast, they keep two days, as
they were not sure originally which might be the
right one. And now, though the calendar is fixed for
a lengthened period, this practice is still continued, so
conservative are the Jews in their customs.  In
America, however, the Reformed Jews now only keep
the feasts on one day. Space will not permit more
than a passing reference to the other sections. With
regard to the medical books, it is, of course, known
that the Jews have excelled as physicians in all ages.
The great Maimonides was physician to the Sultan of
Egypt. Most of the prominent Jews of the Middle
Ages studied medicine. They were pupils of the
Greeks-Hippocrates being their great authority-
and also of the Arabs. Then there are polemical
works directed against the Roman Church; historical










<pb n=154>



documents and chronologies, marriage contracts and
divorces, and charters.
  <p>The Samaritan manuscripts number 63. This is
rather a large collection. They are not very old.
The oldest known is dated <datestruct value="1219--"><year>1219</year></datestruct>, and is at Cam-
bridge; the next oldest, dated <datestruct value="1227--"><year>1227</year></datestruct>, is at Rome;
and the oldest here is of about <datestruct value="1356--"><year>1356</year></datestruct>. That is as
regards books. The oldest scrolls are not dated, but
are probably of the  11th and 12th centuries. The
oldest Hebrew manuscript in the department is,
unfortunately, not dated, but, by comparing it with
the oldest known dated Hebrew manuscript at St.
Petersburg, it is believed to belong to the 9th century.
It is a curious fact that whereas, as regards the
Hebrew scriptures, there is no manuscript that seems
older than the 9th century, there are copies of the
Greek and Syriac translations that go back to the
5th century. This is considered partly due to the persecutions of the Jews and the wholesale destruction of
their writings. It is, however, quite possible that in
the old synagogues of the East some ancient Hebrew
manuscripts may be stowed away still and quite
forgotten, for the Jews of the East set no value on old
copies, a well written modern one being preferred by
them. In conclusion, mention should be made of an
almost unique collection of Caraite manuscripts, which
is one of the treasures of the museum. The Caraites
were a body of Jews who gave up the traditional
beliefs of Judasism and relied on the Bible alone
entirely discarding the Talmud and the Rabbinical
works. There is a large number of controversial
writings, and these are the more valuable, as the
Caraites are dying out. There is only one important





<pb n=155>
Caraite community left. This is in the Crimea, and
it is somewhat singular that it has been exempted
from the persecutions with which the orthodox Jews
have been afflicted.

<HEAD>Royal Weddings at St. James's Palace.</HEAD>

  <p>The first Royal wedding with which St. James's
Palace was associated was that of Henry VIII. with
Anne Boleyn. The marriage did not actually take
place here, the hurried and secret ceremony being
celebrated in a garret at Whitehall; but immediately
afterwards the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">happy pair</q> crossed the secluded
grounds to St. James's, which from that date was used
as a sort of palace of ease to Whitehall. Thus the
history of the place as a Royal residence began with
a Royal wedding. What it had been before, the
student knows, though its early history goes back to
remote antiquity. When the now fashionable quarter
was a barren flat, lying very low, and little better than
a swamp all the year round, a hospital was built here
for lepers in order to isolate them from the population
of London, and dedicated to St. James, the especial
protector of lepers. It was as dreary and lonely a
place as could have been chosen; and the fourteen
unmarried women who were housed in it must have
lived a dreary life in the midst of its unrelieved desola-
tion.  This was long before the advent of the
Normans. As time went on London extended its
borders; and when Henry VIII. swept away all the
monastic establishments, he seized upon the revenues
of this, which then amounted to about &pound;1,000 a year,





<pb n=157>



transformed the building into a Royal Palace, and
brought here his wife Anne Boleyn. When Whitehall
was burned down, St. James's became the permanent
town residence of the sovereign until George III.
removed to Buckingham House, on the site of which
Buckingham Palace now stands; and from that time
the old palace, which still gives its name to the
English Court, has been used for State purposes only.
  <p>Altogether there have been six Royal weddings
here, extending over a period from <datestruct value="1683--"><year>1683</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1858--"><year>1858</year></datestruct>, and
including those of the Queen and the Empress
Frederick. The first, in <datestruct value="1683--"><year>1683</year></datestruct>, was that of Lady Anne,
subsequently Queen Anne, younger daughter of the
Duke of York by his first wife, who was married to
George, Prince of Denmark. The interest in that
marriage was mainly political, being intended to quiet
the uneasiness with which many looked forward to
the accession ot a Popish sovereign. Those were not
days when Royal marriages were regarded as popular
holidays, or as occasions for the display of public
pageantry, as they have become since the introduction
of the daily Press ; and there is little on record save
the celebration of the event. But by the time the
next Royal wedding took place here matters had
altered very considerably in this respect. On the 2nd
of <datestruct value="1761-09-"><month>September</month>, <year>1761</year></datestruct>, George III. married Princess
Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the occasion
was marked by great pomp and circumstance. One
point which seems rather curious is that the Princess
arrived in London in the morning and was married in
the evening.  The same bells that rang out their
joyous greetings before noon were ringing the wedding
peal before midnight. The occasion was one that had





<pb n=158>







given rise to conflicting emotions. The journey of
the Princess to this country had been unduly protracted, the vessel having experienced three different
storms, and been in danger of being driven to Norway,
From Harwich to London by road was an affair of
two days.  The Princess spent her first night in
England at Lord Abercorn's place at Witham, and
next day the King's coach met her at Romford, and
brought her to London. Quite a Royal procession
was formed, what the records call <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">an incredible number of spectators on horse and foot,</q> having gone
many miles out of London to meet the Princess.
Through Stratford, Mile-end, Hackney Turnpike, and
Shoreditch, crowds lined the route. Arrived in London, though the Princess was fatigued by so long and
exciting a journey, no time was lost in the celebration
of the wedding, there being only a short interval for
rest in the Palace before the ceremony at eight o'clock.
Though thus hurried it was a grand affair, and was
carried out with every ceremonial detail. The bride's
procession was long, including maids of honour,
georgeously apparelled servants, pages, and a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">quarter
waiter.</q> The bride was supported by the Duke of
York and Prince William, and her train was borne by
ten unmarried daughters of dukes and earls. The
King's procession included all the great officers of
State, and when the Duke of Cumberland gave the
hand of the bride to His Majesty the Park and Tower
guns fired a <foreign lang=fr>feu de joie</foreign>. On the conclusion of the
marriage ceremony, the Royal couple sat on their
State chairs under a canopy, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the rest of the Royal
family being seated on stools, and the peers, peeresses,
and bishops on benches,</q> while special music was







<pb n=159>

sung. Afterwards a Drawing Room was held, and,
honeymoons not being in fashion, the King and his
bride showed themselves in public places during the
next few days, attracting a great deal of attention.
Indeed, going on the day after the wedding to the
theatre in their chairs, the pressure of the crowd was
so great that the Queen was very much alarmed.
   <p>On <datestruct value="1765-04-08"><month>April</month> <day type=number>8</day>, <year>1765</year></datestruct>, the Prince of Wales (after-
wards George IV.), married Princess Caroline of
Brunswick-a marriage of convenience rather than
of affection, the Prince's debts being very heavy,
and he having given his consent to marry any
wife his Royal parents chose for him.  On this
occasion also there had been some fear for the
safety of the bride, the British squadron which
brought her over being in risk of attack from the
French, and having to lay to in a fog for forty-
eight hours.  The Princess, however, was safely
landed at Greenwich on <datestruct value="-04-05"><day type=name>Sunday</day>, <month>April</month> <day type=number>5</day></datestruct>, and was
accorded a hearty reception.  The acclamations
of the people were unbounded, and the subsequent
journey to Lcndon called forth a great popular
demonstration. Arrived at St. James's Palace, the
Princess took possession of rooms prepared for her
overlooking Cleveland Row. The crowd remained
and huzzad so persistently that the King had himself to go out and beseech them to go away. The
wedding was celebrated in full state, all the great
officers attending. The bride's train was borne by
four unmarried daughters of dukes and earls, and the
bridegroom, who wore his collar of the Garter,
was attended by two unmarried dukes. There was
a third Royal procession, that of the King and Queen,





<pb n=160>







who occupied chairs of State under a canopy in the
church.
  <p>Included in the six Royal weddings that have
taken place at St. James's is that on <datestruct value="1818-07-11"><month>July</month> <day type=number>11</day>, <year>1818</year></datestruct>,
of William  IV. to Queen Adelaide.  It must be
admitted, however, that the authorities are not all
agreed on the <foreign lang=fr>locale</foreign> of the ceremony, for while some
say it was at St. James's, others state that it was celebrated privately at Kew. In either case it was so
private that it may be dismissed with this brief
mention.
  <p>We now come to the wedding of the Queen, before
which all these pale in their present interest.
It took place here in <datestruct value="1840-02-"><month>February</month>, <year>1840</year></datestruct>.  There
are many living who remember that historic occation, the great crowds that assembled in the Park
to witness the arrivals, and the immense enthusiasm
which was displayed; but there are very few
now living who were present in the Chapel Royal.
The Chapel, which had been intended for the
Royal household only, and on ordinary occasions
seated but 150 persons, was so altered, and added
to that 500 distinguished persons were present,
either in the body of the building or the temporary
galleries which rested on light Gothic pillars. The
scene was of great pomp and brilliancy. The Queen's
dress alone cost &pound;1,000; it was of white satin, made
in Spitalfields.  All business was suspended in
London; triumphal arches were erected, illuminations
were general, and the great crowds gathered around
St. James's were a sight in themselves. The weather
was most unpropitious, but the good humour and
buoyancy of spirit of the people, which the occasion







<pb n=161>



was well fitted to call forth, triumphed over the
disagreeable influences of the weather. A heavy rain
which fell in the morning had covered the ground
with water. A great part of the Mall and the space
in front of Buckenham Palace presented an appearance which suggested that some neighbouring river
had overflowed its banks. This, however, did not
prevent large numbers of elegantly dressed ladies
from mingling with the crowd, and standing quietly
there for hours ankle deep in mud. The Queen and
the Prince Consort were received all along the line
from Buckingham Palace with every possible demonstation of affectionate attachment. One description
says :-<quote>It is hardly possible to imagine a stranger
scene than that which the long line of people
presented. Very little could be seen, except by those
on the edge, and therefore the greater part of the
crowd attempted to see what they could by jumping
up, the Royal <foreign lang=fr>cortege</foreign> having the effect as it passed
along of converting Her Majesty's sober lieges into so
many   dancing  dervishes of the most vivacious
description.</quote> It was noticed, too, that the weather
brightened up just before the service, so that,
as far as the Queen was concerned, it was everything
to-be desired.
   <p>Since the wedding of the Queen only one other
marriage has taken place at St. James's. That was
the wedding of the Princess Royal of England
(Empress Frederick) to Prince Frederick of Prussia, on
<datestruct value="1858-01-25"><month>January</month> <day type=number>25</day>. <year>1858</year></datestruct>.   As on the occasion of the
nuptials of the Queen, the weather in the early part of
the day was far from satisfactory. It was a cold
winter's day, with a slight fog; but the streets of
London were made gay with flags and bunting, and








<pb n=162>







the crowds and general enthusiasm    everywhere
recalled the scenes that prevailed on the marriage of
the Queen. <title>The Globe</title> of that day, describing the
the scene, said: <quote>The spectacle was indeed a rare
sight. The pomp and paraphernalia of one of the
oldest monarchies in Europe; all the moral grandeur
attached to a national event in the history of the
greatest empire in the world; the love and reverence
of the whole English nation surrounded the nuptials.</quote>
Speaking of the crowds, it was said :-<quote>The pressure
at some points was frightful, and after the passing of
the Royal procession the mob fairly fought its way
through the lines of the guards and police, Notwithstanding the sharp biting of the frosty air, every good
point of view was taken possession of at an early
hour, and maintained against all comers. . . In all
the approaches to the park ballad singers were rife
with ditties celebrating the event.</quote> Inside the Chapel
Royal the scene was of great splendour. Sir Benjamin
Hall had done everything to make the place look
attractive. It was a happy inspiration of Lady Hall
that, as the chapel was sadly lacking in decorative
features, it should be embellished entirely with flowers.
Foliage and flowering plants were used without stint
and with great effect, forming an admirable background to the gorgeous uniforms of the men and the
splendid Court dresses of the ladies.
  <p>Of the weddings mentioned, only the two last were
celebrated in the Chapel Royal, that building being
converted to its present use three years before the
marriage of the Queen. Formerly it was a guardroom, after having been a lumber-room and a stable,
one of the other rooms in the palace being used as a
private chapel.

<HEAD>St. Martins'-Le-Grand Up To Date.</HEAD>



   <p>If there is one institution in London which more
than any other it is necessary to keep up to date, it is
the General Post Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand. The
bulk of correspondence, periodicals, and circulars
which passes through it daily grows so continuously
that there is a constant demand for more men, more
space, and more machinery. It has elbowed out of
the building altogether other branches of the postal
service, and, having used up every scrap of accommodation the present building can afford, is being
enlarged, in the only way possible, by a new floor at
the top.
  <p>To see the interior of the Post Office at its busiest
the visit should be timed to begin with the rush to
post letters, packets, and papers just before six o'clock,
at which hour the reception ceases-except with an
extra fee -of letters for the country night mails. The
scene then presented is quite exciting. Outside is a
throng of office boys and messengers struggling for
precedence, some with letters and packets done up in
bundles, some with waste paper baskets full, and
others with well filled sacks which they proceed to
empty by putting the mouth of the sack in the
capacious opening for letters and tilting up the sack
by the far end so that the contents flow down like a
cataract. Inside a little army of porters is kept on the
<foreign lang=fr>qui vive</foreign> dragging away the big baskets full of correspondence,





<pb n=164>







which are filled as rapidly as they can be
removed.   But though it seems exciting to the
onlooker, the postal officials regard it is a matter of
course, and the work goes on with mechanical
simplicity. From six o'clock to just before eight,
when the mails are despatched, is an exceptionally
busy time, the work having to be done with quickness and precision in order not only that the trains
may not be missed but that no single letter or newspaper shall be left unsent. An appreciation of the
amount of labour involved may be gleaned from a few
figures which represent the daily average.
  <p>During the morning the number of letters, newspapers, and packets passing through the head office
totals nearly 1,100,000. This is almost equal to the
total for the evening, which is about 1,200,000; but
there is not the same rush at the last moment, and
not so much difficulty to get through the work. So
much is this the case that whereas only 1,550 officials
are employed to make up about 2,350 bags in the
morning, it requires the services of about 2,150 men
to make up the same number of bags in the evening.
At midday and midnight there is a lull; the number
of letters, &amp;c., amounts to 440,000 at the former, and
300,000 at the latter, the number of men employed
being about 1,000 in the midday and 520 during the
midnight hours. But it is by the grand total that
the immense labours of the Post Office, and especially
of this branch, are more accurately gauged; the total
average per day of 24 hours amounting to about
3,000, sent off in about 8,000 bags, by the united
labour of 3,100 persons; or a gross total of a thousand
millions per annum.  And this refers only to the











<pb n=165>



letters, newspapers, &amp;c., which pass through the chief
office, and includes only a portion of those posted in
the suburbs ; the rule being that letters posted in the
suburbs go to the district offices, which deal with those
to be delivered in their own district, and send on the
remainder to St. Martin's-le-Grand.
  <p>We now proceed to follow these letters, which we
have seen dropped into the huge letter boxes, through
the many departments they have to pass until, carefully sealed in the mail bags, they are dropped down
a shoot to the carts in waiting to convey them to the
railway stations. As we turn first into the stamp-
obliterating department we begin to realise what a
vast hive of industry St. Martin's-le-Grand is. You
walk through avenues of letters banked up on every
side. And elbow to elbow are the officers sorting and
stamping, each with his share of a desk before him.
Some of the juniors are placing the letters face upwards, with the stamp in the top right-hand corner,
for the convenience of the stampers. Others carry
the letters thus prepared and give a few at a time to
the stampers, so that each shall have only a small
but never exhausted pile in front of him. Following
on behind, others come and take the defaced letters to
the sorting-room, which we shall presently see. What
strikes one most is the orderliness with which prevails. Though there are hundreds of men working
absolutely shoulder to shoulder, and though there is
little more than enough room to walk between the
rows of them, everything is done with the monotonous
regularity of machinery. Not a voice is to be heard;
no semblance of idleness to be seen; and in a remarkably short interval from the time when they were







<pb n=166>







dropped into the receiving box the letters have passed
through this department and are on their way to the
sorting-room.
  <p>Before we leave here, however, our attention is
drawn to the difference between hand labour and
machinery in defacing the stamps. It is rather curious
that in these days of invention and ingenuity no one
should have been able to improve on the hand-worked
self inking stamp which was invented by Mr Pearson
Hill, son of Sir Rowland Hill. True there is -the
Hoster machine, which, somewhat in the style of a
newspaper printing press, takes the letters from a heap
and throws them up on the other side with the stamp
obliterated. But it is so very apt to miss, and indeed
does miss, so large a proportion, that the time lost
in sorting those not defaced and putting them through
the machine again is so great that the gain by being
able to stamp a larger number of letters per minute is
not appreciated. The few machines that were had on
trial are kept in use; but it is apparently deemed
inexpedient to further supplant hand labour by
machinery, and so there still remain the long rows of
busy stamp-obliterators, whose dexterity claims attention thus early in the visit.
  <p>By the time a walk round this department has been
completed, all idea of the geography of the place has
been lost, and the visitor follows his escort helplessly
through a maze of rooms and corridors, rarely losing
sight of busy throngs of men and youths, who are well
drilled units in a gigantic scheme, with a set task
which they carry out within circumscribed limits.
From the stamping room we turn aside to see the
department which deals exclusively with the Government









<pb n=167>



correspondence, and learn that all this is kept
entirely apart from the public letters. This again is a
great place, and the amount of correspondence appears
to vie in quantity with that in which the general
public letters. And not only does it have to go-
through the same processes, but in addition a strict
watch is kept to see that all the letters and packets
are properly franked-to which end a book is kept at
hand of signatures of the officials of each department
empowered to frank letters-and an account is kept
of the weight of the letters sent by each department,
in order that the revenue from the postage can be
balanced against each office, Having seen how these
are received, arranged, stamped, weighed, and sorted,
we pass on to the general sorting-room.
  <p>And now we begin to see the processes by which
the great piles of letters, hitherto jumbled together
in chaotic heaps, are gradually weeded out and
arranged in small bundles according to their destinations. With a view to keeping apart those for
town, country, and abroad, different posting boxes are
provided; but though individuals will pay attention
to this provision, the office boys and door porters who
bring their great piles almost entirely disregard it,
and therefore add considerably to the trouble of
dealing with the letters; as inside the office the town,
country, foreign newspapers, and registered letters are
all kept distinct, though, with the exception of the
registered letters, all undergo the same processes,
These processes, when once the system is understood.
are extremely simple. The first sorting is into what
are called railway divisions, including large towns,
foreign, suburban, metropolitan district, East Central





<pb n=168>




(City), and Irish and Scotch. For each of these
divisions men are kept, who, walking behind
the sorter, takes those sorted, and, putting them into
a basket, carries them on to the next department.
There is thus no accumulation of letters before any
man, and the work is got through in the smallest
possible space of time. Should the address of any
not be legible, or the the sorter not know which
division it should go into, these are put into the
pigeon-box labelled <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">blind.</q> These are collected in
the same way, and carried into the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">blind</q> department, where skilled sorters do their best to rectify
errors of address. If any are found with the stamps
not defaced they go back to the first room, and if
any are open or injured they go into the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">infirmary</q>
to be patched up. In the next department the
letters are further sorted into <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">roads</q>-the name
being a survival of the old coaching days-each road
comprising a large town, or several large towns, and
the surrounding villages, and then, done up in small
bundles, tied tightly together with string, they are
ready to be put in the mail bags, sealed, and sent
away.
  <p>In the newspaper department, so large is the bulk
of the papers that it seems a Herculean task to stamp
and sort them. Shortly after six o'clock, when the
evening papers have been posted, there are great
heaps on huge tables, and the uninitiated would deem
it impossible that they could all be got rid of by ten
minutes to eight, but so well does the system work
that, as with the letters, the heaps are rapidly
diminished, and the tables cleared in good time for
the outgoing mails. This is much facilitated by









<pb n=169>



keeping the papers entirely distinct from the packets
and the circulars. Otherwise confusion would be the
inevitable, as it is not uncommon for some of the large
advertising firms to send down as many as half a
million of circulars at a time, all of which have to go
through the same processes. Then there is the
foreign section, which is by no means the least
interesting, with its bulky letters from bankers and
commercial houses in the city to their branches
abroad, and those for the soldiers and sailors of Her
Majesty's services in various parts of the world. On
this night the Indian, China, and Australian mail
consisted of 1,600 bags. It is impossible to conjecture
what the grand total would be if a universal penny
post was adopted. From the foreign section the next
step is to the registered letter department.  The
method of dealing with registered letters-how each
one is checked, and every man through whose hand it
passes has to keep a receipt for it-has been explained
over and over again. So thoroughly has this department been brought up to date that no registered
letter can now miscarry without it being at once
perceived in whose possession it was last.
  <p>There only remains to be mentioned the infirmary,
where undecipherable and enigmatic addresses are
dealt with, and here it appears that the amount of
trouble caused to the authorities is due not so much
to ignorance and bad handwriting-though that is by
no means unknown even after twenty odd years of
board schools-but by the waggish proclivities of
people who write the addresses on the old puzzle
fashion; Maidstone, for instance, being represented by
drawings of a girl and a stone; Sevenoaks by a





<pb n=170>







drawing of seven oak trees; Surrey by <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Surr</q> and
then an eye; and Southampton by a pig and then
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">th,</q> a ham, then a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">p,</q> and finally a drawing of a
one ton weight. The amount of time, too, that will
be spent in decorating the envelope is astonishing,
some being on an elaborate scale in black and white,
and others in colours. Many of the most curious of
these have been copied into a scrap book, the exhibition of which is the closing feature of the visit. In
conclusion, it should be added that the two gentlemen
on whose shoulders the responsibilityfor this section
of Post Office business mainly rests are Messrs.
Badcock and Sanderson, respectively Controller and
Sub-Controller of the Department, and heavy indeed
must it be. To keep such a gigantic and far reaching
business up to date must be a source of endless
anxiety to all the higher officials of St. Martin's-le
Grand even at ordinary seasons, but what must it be
when the work is increased a hundredfold, if it will
shortly be at the season fast approaching, when all
but Post Office officials post their letters, parcels, &amp;c.,
with a light heart, and leave them to the tender
mercies of the most useful of all Government
Departments.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=30>
<HEAD>A Visit to Newgate.</HEAD>

  <p>Newgate Prison is not generally included in the
itinerary of visitors to London. There is some little
difficulty about it, owing to the necessity for obtaining a special permit from the Lord Mayor or one of
the City Aldermen. Yet there is much of interest in
the old place; and that interest is not necessarily of a
morbid character.  Another difficulty in the way of
intending visitors is that the prison can only be seen
on a Wednesday or Thursday between the hours of
twelve and three; and this only in those weeks when
the Old Bailey Sessions are not being held.  On
those occasions the prison is used for the accommodation of the prisoners to be tried. Newgate, as is well-
known, ceased to be used as an ordinary prison many
years ago, but during the sittings of the Central
Criminal Court prisoners are temporarily housed
there, to prevent the necessity of taking them backwards to Holloway night and morning. Then, should
a prisoner be sentenced to death, he or she lingers out
the last three weeks of life in one of the two
condemned cells; and during that period the merely
curious visitor is not allowed' within the grim and
grimy portals of the prison.  It may, therefore,
happen that the holder of an <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">order to view</q> may
have it in his possession some two or three months,
and pay several visits to the place, before being successful in gaining admittance. As exceptions to the






<pb n=172>




general rule it may be mentioned that the grand
juries at the Old Bailey Sessions are always taken
round the prison, as a sort of solatium for their
attendance, which, indeed, is the only one they have;
and jurors attending the inquests on executed
prisoners are similarly favoured.
  <p>There is no trouble when one has passed the heavily
spiked wicket gate, at the top of a narrow flight of
steps, just before reaching the old debtor's door,
through which many famous prisoners passed to their
doom in the famous <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">hanging days.</q>  The warders
are particularly affable; and seem to take a personal
delight in showing you the treasures and curiosities
of the place. So much is this the case that one begins
to wonder whether it is a case for half-a-crown or five
shillings; and finally feels a strange surprise when
the janitor points to a printed notice that no tips are
allowed.  However, that is anticipating.  Having
shown your authorisation to view the prison, and
noted the immense thickness of the outside walls, you
are taken through a rather gloomy corridor; and the
sight-seeing begins rather gruesomely. In a cupboard
in a short passage are plaster casts taken from the
heads of celebrated criminals, now almost forgotten-
Muller, Greenacre, Wainwright, Thurtell, and a host
of others. It is an unpleasant sight except to the
the student of physiognomy, and one is pleased to
hear that the practice of taking these casts has been
discontinued.  A few yards further on another cupboard is opened, and there are revealed shackles and
chains, handcuffs and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">leg-cuffs</q> of various patterns,
making a goodly array.  One special set of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">cuffs</q>
for hands and feet is pointed out as being those in





<pb n=173>

which Jack Sheppard escaped from gaol. Then the
stalwart warder lifts from a recess with much difficulty
owing to their weight, the cumbrous irons which were
specially forged for the redoubtable highwayman;
and one hears with some amusement that he actually
escaped from these.  The blacksmith made them so
big and weighty that he defeated his own end.  It
was necessary to pad the part fitting round the ankle,
and Sheppard, picking away the wadding, was able to
get his feet out of the irons. Noting the thickness of
the walls and the heavily-barred windows, one expresses great admiration for his pluck and
perseverence; but it is explained that this occurred before
the prison was rebuilt, and when it was not the
massive stronghold it now is.
  <p>From here the visitor is ushered through other
corridors, and shown the little barred cages in which
prisoners are put when consulting their solicitors or
friends.  Then a short flight of steps leads to the
prison chapel; and one looks up at the curiously-
constructed grille behind which the female prisoners,
very much in the style of the lady visitors to the
House of Commons, can see and hear without being
seen themselves. By this time the visitor has reached
the prison proper; the series of corridors open to the
roof, with rows of cells on each side.  There is a
feeling of surprise here; for one may naturally have
expected to see the old stone cells of a century ago,
before Howard had commenced his crusade in favour
of prison reform. But it is explained that the whole
of this part was rebuilt, as the result of the outbreak
of gaol-fever, which time after time decimated the
ranks of the jurors, and others, at the Old Bailey. As





<pb n=174>







a result, the prison is now on an entirely modern
principle, just as is adopted in most of Her Majesty's
gaols. There is the same small cell with hammock
bed which rolls up during the day; a little fixed table
in the darkest corner, holding a tin mug, a wooden
spoon, and a Bible, and an uncomfortable-looking
stool which is also a fixture. Down another flight of
stairs the dark cell, which used to be for the punishment of refractory prisoners, is shown. Invited inside
to try the effect, the gaoler goes out and double locks
the double doors behind him, leaving you in a darkness that can almost be felt. And all the furniture
of these places is a plank bed, and a wooden pillow,
both as immovable as the walls themselves. Then
crossing a passage, a double cell is reached. There
is nothing to indicate what it is, but one instinctively
feels that it is the condemmed cell, in which so many
poor wretches have passed their last days on earth.
This is the male condemned cell-that for females
which last accommodated Mrs Pearcey, is on the
women's side of the prison, and is much the same. A
bare cheerless place,  In the centre is a narrow
wooden bedstead, very low, on which the prisoners
sleep. Against one wall is a table and two stools for
the warders, who never leave him; and that is all in
the way of furniture. But there are one or two
Scripture texts on the walls; and it is noticeable that
the door is so constructed that the warders too are
under surveillance from the outside. There is no
hope of escape for the prisoner who once enters this
doorway.
  <p>With this the prison cells are left behind.
Immediately outside is the exercise ground; a dismal








<pb n=175>



looking parallelogram of paved courtyard, with such
high walls on either side that it seems like looking up
to the sky from the bottom of a well. Near by, in an
old shed-for it is not now used-is the old whipping-
post, in which many prisoners have been flogged with
the cat-o'-nine tails, which lies upon it. Invited to
stand inside it, a wooden partition at the bottom grips
you round the legs just under the knees; and
your wrists are held tight by a cross-bar.  It
gives you a distinctly unpleasant sensation of
helplessness; even though you are not in any
fear that the warder who flourishes the long-
tailed cat around you will lay it across your shoulders.
From here you go down another long courtyard,
which seems a repetition of the exercise-ground you
have recently left; but there are curious letters on
the walls; and the top is covered in with a grating.
This is what old goal-birds, who have a life acquaintance with the Old Bailey, have christened
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Birdcage Walk</q>-they have to pass through it from the cells
to the court. In the case of a man to be tried for
murder, his feelings must be of an unenviable character as he marches to and from the court, for it is
here that prisoners are buried after execution, and
the initials on the walls denote the occupants of
the graves. Some gruesome details are given-which
need not be repeated here-as one passes on; and a
shed is seen in which you are informed the executions
take take place. This is not open for inspection; and
all that remains to be seen is the kitchen where the
prisoners' food is prepared ; and in which is shown
the door through which prisoners in the days of public
execution passed to the gallows. Then, having written

<pb n=176>
your name in the visitors' book, you pass out into
the street, with the feeling that you have seen an historic institution which will soon cease to exist ; for
Newgate has been doomed to destruction, and will
sooner or later share the fate of Millbank.


<pb n=177>
<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=31>
<HEAD>The End of the Old Bailey.</HEAD>

  <p>While the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Crown of Towers</q> that composed Millbank was being pulled down and brought under the
hammer, fate was busy with another historic institution
which has played a still more important part in the
annals of crime. The appointment by the Common
Council of a committee to select a site for a new
building for the Central Criminal Court, points
to the fact that the Old Bailey, as a Court of
Sessions, will soon cease to exist.  Its adjacent
prison, Newgate, last served its original purpose
in <datestruct value="1877--"><year>1877</year></datestruct>, save during the sittings of the Central
Criminal Court when it is used as a gaol of detention, and occasionally afterwards when <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">some poor
wretch condemned to die</q> lives out within its
gloomy walls his last three weeks of life. Thus the
link which has so long connected the two has been
preserved and to this extent will exist to the last.
Not until the Central Criminal Court goes to more
salubrious quarters on the Embankment, and the
tribunal curiously composed of Judges, Recorder,
Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Serjeant finds
a new habitation in a gorgeous Palace of Justice by
the water side, will the link be finally broken. Newgate will be improved from off the face of the earth;
and this site, upon which justice has been dispensed
and executed time out of mind, will have to look for
fresh associations.







<pb n=179>







   <p>There is no record of when first the trial of culprits
 took place here. Even the derivation of the familiar
 name of Old Bailey is open to dispute ; the various
 learned authorities differing very widely as to its
 genesis. One says that it comes from the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ballium,</q>
 or outer space near the wall of Ludgate, reaching
 from Ludgate Hill to Newgate Street, which has been
 traced in some massive stone-work near Peacoal Lane,
 at the bottom of Breakneck Steps. Another, that it
 is a corruption of Bail Hill, which means a place for
 the trial of prisoners by a bailiff, just as the name
 Bail-dock is retained for the cell or place in which
 criminals are kept while awaiting their trial. Again
 we read that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ballum</q> is a corruption of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">vallum,</q>
 and an explanation is given that where there were
 two courts to a castle, they were distinguished as the
 outer or inner bailey, or rampart; and that sub-
 sequently the word which applied to the whole of the
 court and buildings became attached to the castle, as
 in the case of the Bailey, at Oxford. However that
 may be, the Old Bailey, or, more familiarly, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the
 Bailey</q> has been the name by which the Court has
 been known, and that it will cling to it to the last is
 beyond question. But when the court is removed, the
 name must go too. It is not only that it would be
 incongruous to call a brand new building, in a modern
 boulevard, by the name of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Old Bailey,</q> or that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">New
 Bailey</q> is obviously objectionable. But as a matter
 of fact the court has now no legal right to the name
at all, for when in <datestruct value="1884--"><year>1884</year></datestruct> an Act was passed which
considerably widened its jurisdiction the name of
Central Criminal Court was conferred on it. It is true
that the general public have never taken kindly to the





<pb n=179>

new designation. The newspapers have given it a
half-hearted adoption by sometimes speaking of it
as the Central Criminal Court and sometimes as the
Old Bailey; but in conversation the new name, though
Serjeant Robinson, in his memoirs, declares it to be a
more euphonious one than it was intended to replace,
is rarely used. The Old Bailey it was before the
earliest records were written, and nothing short of its
entire removal from the locality could bring about the
adoption of a new title.
  <p>The decision to provide a new court has come none
too soon, for the accommodation has long been inadequate; and the condition of affairs in the principal
court during a sensational trial is something to be
remembered for a life time. Things are not so bad
now as in <datestruct value="1750--"><year>1750</year></datestruct>, when the Lord Mayor, two judges,
one alderman, several jurymen, and numerous witnesses all caught the goal fever and died. That was
in the days of the court which the present building
replaced ; but it was due, of course, more to the condition of affairs in the prison than want of air and
ventilation in the Court itself; and matters have been
wonderfully improved in this respect, thanks to the
reforms set on foot about that time by Howard, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the
prisoner's friend.</q> But when, some 20 years later,
there was another, and yet more fatal outbreak, it was
felt that the Court, too, called for improvement, and
the present buildings were erected partly on the site
of the old Surgeon's Hall, to which Oliver Goldsmith
went up for examination in <datestruct value="1758--"><year>1758</year></datestruct> and was rejected.
This building has existed with little alteration or
improvement, save a slight enlargement in the early
part of the present century, to the present day, and





<pb n=180>







has long been felt to be miserably inadequate for the
accommodation of the persons having to attend, and
a very poor structure for the first criminal court of the
country. Still it has many historic associations, and
by the removal of the Court and of the prison London
lose landmarks which are amongst its oldest and most
renowned.
  <p>Many memories cling to the prison and the court
which, in a sense, has been part and parcel of it for
so many years; so notable have been the malefactors
who, having been tried and condemned in the one
have been executed in the other. With them are
connected the names of Titus Oates, Jack Sheppard,
whose manacles are still to be seen, and numerous
others who figure in the chronicles of Newgate. The
place has witnessed many changes since the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Monday
matinees</q> were commenced, which were patronised
by Lord Tom Noddy and his friends. This was
when, Tyburn Tree having been abolished in <datestruct value="1783--"><year>1783</year></datestruct>,
public executions were commenced in Newgate. It
was after this that the individual who became famous
as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the Newgate bellman</q> perambulated the street
at night outside the condemned cell, calling out to the
unhappy occupants who were to die in the morning:
<quote><l>All you that in the condemned hold do lie
       <l>Prepare you for to-morrow you shall die
       <l>Watch all and pray the hour is drawing near
       <l>When you before the Almighty must appear,
       <l>Examine well yourselves, in time repent
       <l>That you may not to eternal flames be sent,
       <l>And when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls
       <l>The Lord have mercy on your souls.</quote>
  <p>Public executions were not abolished until <datestruct value="1868--"><year>1868</year></datestruct>
and it was eleven years later that Newgate ceased to
be used regularly as a prison. It would have ceased,




<pb n=181>
altogether, but that at the Old Bailey there is no
accommodation for the detention of prisoners, and
Newgate had perforce to be used during the sittings
of the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">C.C.C.</q> until some other arrangements could
be made. Accommodation of that character will have
to be provided in the new buildings, which will be too
far away from Newgate for the cells there to be of
any use, and then this old prison, which was erected
on the ashes of the one burned down in the No Popery
Riots in <datestruct value="1780--"><year>1780</year></datestruct>, will be ready to follow the example of
Millbank, and add another to the growing list of
prisons which have disappeared in London. The
site, there can be no doubt, will be put to better
use, as has been the case with those that have gone
before. Clerkenwell Prison, it' will be remembered,
now serves for the Parcels Post, which has been
crowded out of St. Martin's-le-grand; and where
Horsemonger Lane Gaol once stood, children now
disport themselves in a public recreation ground. It
was at this latter prison, at the execution of the
Mannings, that Dickens saw the hideous scene of riot
which, on his depicting it in the <title>Times</title> next morning, led to the abolition of public hangings. These
prisons will all have disappeared within a very few
years; and though they will be missed by our country
cousins, London can well afford to part with them.

<HEAD>Orientalism at Woking.</HEAD>



  <p>Travellers by the South Western Railway, on the
main line, must have noticed a curious colony of
buildings just before reaching Woking Station. One
with its large cupola and flanking minarets looks as
though it had been imported bodily from the East.
Near it is a square building of Indian design, with
flat roof and broad balcony, which, though rather
more homelike in structure, reminds one forcibly of
Oriental architecture; while the third is a long row
of buildings, which look more like a row of almshouses than anything else. These are the component
parts of the Oriental University Institute which Dr.
Leitner has established, and the interior of which
possesses features of interest which deserve to be more
widely and more generally known. Before proceeding to describe a recent visit, it may be explained
that the Institute was founded in <datestruct value="1884--"><year>1884</year></datestruct>, to be not only
a centre of Oriental learning, with musuem, library,
and other aids to study; but with special provision so
that natives of the East of good family shall be
enabled to preserve their religion or caste while residing in England for educational or official purposes.
  <p>To that end are special apartments arranged on a
system of monastic simplicity, in which Hindoo or
Mahomedan can live apart, with his own servants to
prepare his food.  A special well has been sunk, that
the Hindoo can have his water supply uncontaminated




<pb n=183>

by water from any other source. A mosque has been
built that the Mahomedan on his little square of
carpet can follow his prescribed form of worship,
with his face duly turned towards Mecca, and his eyes
falling on nothing that shall distract his attention
from his orisons.  It is the only mosque in England,
if not the only one in Europe; and as it was not
intended to be for any special sect or country, its structure is of a designedly composite character, The front
is Cairean, the minarets and dome are Mogul, the ornaments are Turkish, and so on; so that from
whatever country a Mahomedan may come he will see
something to remind him of his native country. Just
before the door is a little pool of water in which the
worshipper can wash his feet, according to his custom,
before going into the mosque.  The water supplied
to this is, of necessity, by means of a pipe, but the
supply is so arranged as to give a bubbling effect, in
imitation of a little fountain supplied from a spring
such as the Mahomedan would find in his own
country. The mosque is also kept free from the
pollution of boot-leather, and the English visitor who
would see the interior must either look through the
open doorway, or remove his boots like one of the
faithful.
  <p>The square Indian building before mentioned is a
residence; one wing for Hindoos and the other for
Mahomedans, so arranged as to meet any caste
requirements.  Here natives who have come over
to this country for educational purposes have free
lodging; furnishing their own rooms, and being
allowed to live in their own way. The more extensive
range of buildings is that to which we have referred






<pb n=184>







as presenting the appearance of a row of almshouses.
But that is only as seen from the railway. On a
nearer acquaintance it is seen at once that it is something very different. As a matter of fact, it is a range
of buildings originally erected as a Dramatic College,
and built in rather costly and elaborate style, with a
colonnade, the pillars of which have capitals on which
are carved scenes illustrative of Shakespeare's plays.
Here is to be found, in a large well-lighted hall, with
open and partially-glazed roof, a museum of Oriental
art, containing much that is absolutely unique. There
are ancient manuscripts in rich profusion of the
greatest historical value; there are Graeco-Buddhistic
and other sculptures; art, industrial, and ethnographical exhibits, chiefly intended to compare
European with Eastern culture, to show the influence
of Greek art on Egypt, Asia Minor, Persia, and
Northern India, and to illustrate the regions between
Russian and the British spheres of influence in Asia.
  <p>A brief survey of this museum reveals some
interesting points. In the gallery one sees a number
of illustrations of Dr. Leitner's discovery with regard
to the Cashmere shawl, which has now practically
become a thing of the past. Everything in India, as
is well known, is connected with religion, but it was
left to Dr. Leitner to show that this was the case with
the Cashmere shawl. He it was who found that what
was supposed to be a pattern was in reality based on
language, and appealed to the religious sense of the
people. The Frenchmen came, and thinking it
merely a pattern, proceeded to improve upon it, with
the effect that the shawl lost its effect on the native
mind and the industry was destroyed. Here also is a










<pb n=185>



collection of paintings of the religious mendicants of
India; and another collection of paintings of the
various manufactures.  In a corner is a unique
collection of Indian musical instruments, mostly
string, some extremely complicated, and requiring not
only skill but great manual dexterity to play on;
and some in the simplest possible form-a mere
tendril of the vine stretched upon a sort of bow.
Contrary to  general belief, the native  Indians
have a great knowledge of music, and native
music is often very charming, but is rarely
heard by Europeans, who, judging from the feeble
imitation of British music by fifth rate musicians,
which is generally all that they hear, form a
very erroneous idea of musical accomplishments
of the Hindoo.    There is also  a specimen of
that curious  sort of panpipe which   is played
by being pressed against the throat and emits a
hideous sound. In another corner is a collection of
native medicines, and one learns with surprise that
ages ago the- Indian medicine man knew all about
microbes and disease germs, though he was only
laughed at because he always represented them as
minute worms.   After all, his description was as
sensible as calling them  bacilli, which interpreted
means <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">little sticks.</q>
   <p>But this is not the only instance in the museum
 which lends emphasis to the old saying that there is
 nothing new under the sun. There is here a book of
 Persian production, with raised letters, so that the
 blind should be able to read. It was generally supposed that the system of reading for the blind by
 means of raised letters was a European discovery;





<pb n=186>







but manuscripts of this class have existed in Persia
from the oldest times. Some of these are to be found
among the manuscripts on the ground floor. Here
also are Eastern coins, some of them unique-there
are at least eighty varieties, not possessed by the
British Museum-relics from funeral pyres, a small
but interesting Egyptian collection, including a
mummy, the outer case of which opens, showing
the mummified body, denuded of its wrappings,
inside; trophies from Asia, and a great variety of
other exhibits.
  <p>Space will not permit anything like a detailed
reference to these things. Speaking generally, they
are thoroughly representative, and so numerous as to
require many days to examine them with any minuteness. But something more should be said of the
Graeco-Buddhistic sculptures, because they illustrate
another of Dr. Leitner's discoveries, and one of very
great interest.  It deals with the specific Greek
influence which fixed a period in the history of art, of
religion, and of the general history of India. Before
this era Indian mythology represented omnipotence
by many arms, omniscience by many eyes; the representations of the human form were very crude, and
art was at its lowest level. But Alexander the Great,
on his invasion of India, was accompanied by some
sculptors, and Alexander's great object was to improve
the state of India, and bring it up to the Grecian
standard. The result is illustrated by sculptures of
the two periods placed side by side. The human
figures lost their grotesqueness; omniscience, instead
of being represented by many eyes, was represented
by expression; omnipotence by attitude. The Greek




<pb n=187>

model was adopted, and adapted to Indian subjects;
and Dr. Leitner has shown that this was a conse-
quence of Alexander's invasion, and not of Roman or
Byzantine origin, because the evidences of it were
found to follow the routes taken by Alexander, and
not to exist in the neighbourhood of the seaports. A
hundred miles to either side of these routes they
ceased to exist.

<HEAD>The Art of Watch Making.</HEAD>



  <p>An addition has been made to the Museum of the
Guildhall of a very practical character. As is well
known there has been for some time in one of its
departments the collection of watches and clocks of
the Clockmakers' Company; and many will have
gazed in wonder at the curious old <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">grandfathers</q>
which are here collected together; the clock with
wooden wheels, the one driven by gas, the electric
clock, and the many others that are strangely
interesting even to the casual observer,  To this
department has been added the collection of watches
formed by the Rev. H. L. Nelthropp, and presented
by him to the Clockmakers' Company, of which he is
the Master.
  <p>The collection, which is chronologically arrayed in
a very handsome case, so arranged with mirrors that
top, bottom, and sides of each watch can be seen,
affords an admirable object lesson in the art and
mystery of watchmaking, though neither so old nor so
full of incident as the art of clockmaking, is one of
great interest. It is almost impossible to allude to
the history of the one without referring to the other.
The writer on the history of watches would naturally
begin with the sun dial, and, passing on to the
clepsydra, would note how Julius Caesar by one of the
latter discovered that the British night was shorter
than that of Gaul. But the watch really has no connection










<pb n=189>



with the water-working time keeper so largely
used in Rome. It was at the beginning of the 16th
century that watches, or <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">pocket clocks,</q> as they
were called, were first introduced, and in this collection
one readily recognises those of the earliest date,
because of the peculiar egg-shape, which caused them
to be termed <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Nuremberg eggs</q> or <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Nuremberg
living eggs.</q> The early days of watchmaking are
like the birthplace of Jeames de la Pluche <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">wropt in
mystry,</q> but the claim of Nuremburg to be their
birthplace is generally conceded. Very curious, and
not a little cumbersome they look, though not so
bulky as some of those of later date. One feature
with regard to them is that the mainspring was not
enclosed in a barrel, but the outer end of the spring
was bent into the shape of a hook, and fixed to the
winding arbor, together with a ratchet wheel and
click.  It was wound up from    the centre, the
re-expansion setting the works in motion.
  <p>In all the early watches the movements were made
entirely of iron or steel. This is explained by the fact
that the first watch and clockmakers were in reality
locksmiths. Brass, though occasionally used for part
of the movement, did not become general for the
whole construction until after <datestruct value="1560--"><year>1560</year></datestruct>. Before that came
about-and it is interesting to trace these improvements in old timekeepers that were once a source of
pride and joy to their owners-a material improvement had been effected. It was soon perceived that
the action of the main spring was greater at the
height of its expansion than at the end, and that from
this cause great irregularity resulted.  This was
remedied by a feat of mechanism which received the





<pb n=190>







curious title  of stack-freed.  It was eminently
ingenious, but at the same time very simple. It was
a retarding spring which checked the power of the
main spring when at its full strength. As that power
became less it acted with diminished force, at length
changing to an accelerating action, thus to a large
extent equalising the effects of the moving power.
  <p>The next notable period in the march of progress
is the advent of the round watch, which came into
fashion in <datestruct value="1610--"><year>1610</year></datestruct>.  Of these there are numerous
examples, and it is notable how the cases were
improved in quality, and how diverse were the materials
used. Perhaps the most curious is one with a leather
case, ornamented with silver devices. Some of the
gold pique cases are very fine. Then came a period
when enamel was largely used. Mr. Nelthropp seems
to have had a great fancy for these, and collected a
large number of very choice examples. All this time
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">pocket clocks</q> were improving in appearance, but
not in time-keeping qualities, and it was not until
Thomas Grignion hit upon the horizontal principle
in  watch-making that any decided improvement
in this respect was effected. Grignion was the man
who made the clock for the tower of St. Paul's,
Covent Garden. Thenceforward improvements followed at irregular intervals, which it would take too
long to trace, but which this collection illustrates in
every phase. Principal among them are the use of
escapements working on diamonds and rubies, the
rack lever invented by the Abbe Hautefeuille, the
compensation balance invented by Le Roy, and the
winding of the spring from the back, introduced by
Breguet.









<pb n=191>



   <p>Here it may be said that perhaps the rarest watches
extant are those which were made by Breguet about
the middle of the eighteenth century. Watches made
by him have always been greatly valued, and command a high price because of the beauty and finish of
the workmanship. The only artist who ever attempted
to excel him was Ruegger, of Geneva, whose watches
are extremely scarce, and doubtless commanded a
high price when new. It was perhaps owing to the
high estimation of watches at this time that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day was induced
to put a tax on them. In <datestruct value="1897--"><year>1897</year></datestruct> an annual duty of 5s
was put upon every clock; 10s. on every gold watch
worn or used; and 2s. 6d. for every watch of silver or
other metal. This tax, however, was not of long
duration, the Act being repealed in the following
year.
  <p>Looked at from another point of view, this collection of watches indicates certain well defined periods
of watchmaking. There are the "Nuremberg eggs,"
the early round watches, and then the verge-which
is the earliest escapement of which there exists any
description. The name was derived from the shape
of the scape wheel, which acted on pallets attached
to the verge or axis of the balance. The want of a
spiral spring at first rendered them  very defective
timekeepers, but after the application of a spring they
were made to keep good time, and were in repute up
to a comparatively recent period. The introduction
of other escapements caused their construction to be
neglected. Workmen were not taught to make them,
and in time became unable to mend them. The next
period is that of the horizontal or cylinder watch, first




<pb n=192>







made by Tompion in <datestruct value="1693--"><year>1693</year></datestruct>, and the idea of which was
perfected by George Graham a little later. Some
very fine examples of these are in the collection.
Then comes the lever movement, which was invented
in <datestruct value="1722--"><year>1722</year></datestruct> by Abbe Hautefeuille, followed by the
chronometer escapement invented by Earnshaw. It
only remains to speak of the repeater, which during
the last part of last century was all the rage. Every
one who could afford it wanted a watch he could
see by day and hear by night, though the prices
ranged from &pound;70 to &pound;120. The first of these, made
by the Rev. Mr Barlow in <datestruct value="1676--"><year>1676</year></datestruct>, had two push pieces,
but Daniel Quare, a celebrated watchmaker of
London, succeeded in making one with only one push
piece. Perhaps the keyless watch ought to be added
as a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">period.</q> The keyless is quite modern, though
the idea is not a new one, the earlier watchmakers
objecting to any unnecessary increase in the
mechanism of the watch. But the keyless watch has
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">caught on,</q> and may in some subsequent age be
added to a collection of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">curiosities,</q> such as that
which is now open for inspection at the Guildhall.

<HEAD>The Cab Horse at Home.</HEAD>

  <p>With the cab horse at work everyone is familiar.
Sometimes he commands admiration; often profound
pity; but speaking generally there has been a great
improvement since the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals came into existence, with its
army of neatly-uniformed inspectors all over the
Metropolis, always on the alert for cases of cruelty,
and especially watchful for the worn-out <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">screws</q>
that used to be kept specially for dark nights
and foggy weather. These are by no means unknown now, though the proportion of good, sound,
well-treated animals is greater than ever it was;
partly because of the vigilance of Mr. Colam
and his men, and partly because of the competition of the unexceptionable turn-outs of the
Shrewsbury-Talbot and other wealthy companies,
which have, to a large extent, run the rickety hansom
and the worn-out hack off the streets. But it is much
to be feared that the cab-horse at home is not much
better off than he used to be. Leave out of consideration the few large owners who, having plenty of
capital, are able to ensure that the animals on whose
exertions they depend for their dividends are well
housed and well fed, there still remain a vast majority
that run down a whole gamut of gradation from
shabby gentility to actual poverty and semi-starvation.
In this respect the equine population of the metropolis











<pb n=194>



is comparable with the human. There is a good deal
of showy make-believe-a good appearance out
of doors, but at home a lack of the barest necessities of life, and no acquaintance at all with its
comforts.
  <p>There are one or two features common to all cabyards graduating downwards from the second-rate.
They are always more or less on the outskirts of the
wealthier parts of the town; always approached by
tortuous alleys or passages ankle deep in water or
slush; the yard may be small or large, but it is always
paved with big granite blocks that seem to have been
laid with a special design for the collection of dirty
water; wheels and broken down portions of cabs lean
against the walls and litter the place generally; while
every part is reeking with refuse, and in a corner
where you are least likely to suspect it is a snarling
dog with a well developed antipathy to strangers.
Let us take a look at one situated at Walworth. As
you walk along the busy thoroughfare which leads
from the Elephant to Peckham, if you are of an observant nature and happen to hit upon the right time of
the day, you will see a procession of hansoms of all
grades turn sharp round into what appears a cul-de-
sac devoid of houses. If you have had any previous
acquaintance with these matters, you know at once by
the broken state of the road, where the water lies in
pools, that you are in the region of some cabyards,
and that the cabmen are going to change their horses.
Walk down a little way, and you will see other roads
leading off at right angles. Having left the din of
the streets behind, you begin to hear the blacksmith's
hammer, and smell the farrier's heated iron. Another







<pb n=195>



cab drives up behind you, and as it splashes you from
head to foot you turn into what proves a real cul-de-
sac. There is a smithy on one side, where men are
busy making shoes. It is not the ideal smithy associated with the spreading chestnut tree, but a little
tumbledown shed, in which the men work in a clearing made among the lumber of broken up vehicles,
and heaps of rusty iron work. Immediately opposite
is the yard-gate of the owner of five cabs and eleven
horses. One of the cabs, quite a respectable hansom,
is left in the alley just outside the gate.
  <p>You do not wonder why it is left there when you
see the yard, because if it was inside it would be next
to impossible to get round it to go up to the house.
The most curious feature of the place is that almost
everything is of wood.  There was only a little
house here once, but odd places have been built up
all around ; a combination of curious structures that
might be described as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">a thing of sheds and patches.</q>
One is a stable with a loft above it-the home of the
eleven horses. At the top of the wooden ladder
is a wooden box well glazed, which the proprietor
uses as a counting house and post of observation-
the dog's kennel is hidden away underneath within
easy reach of the stable door. Another lean-to at the
side of the dwelling is the harness room; another
shed some few feet square is the granary. The cabs
evidently remain outside all night, for there is no
place where they could be stowed away. But it is
the stable that we have come to see, and it proves a
typical one. Open the door, and you leave light and
air behind. Walk through a puddle of water, keeping close to the horses' feet, and you see them in their




<pb n=196>




boxes. There are six of these, and if you express
surprise that they should suffice for eleven horses, you
learn that London stables are worked on the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Box
and Cox</q> arrangement-the whole family is never
at home at once. But it is the diminutive size of the
stalls that surprises you most, for it seems absolutely
impossible that the animals can lie down in them.
You remark this, and are informed that they manage
very comfortably. If, still incredulous, you suggest
that none are lying down, though having been out all
night, the ostler points triumphantly to the fact that
the floor is covered with a thin layer of shavings, and
clinches the argument by remarking that they would
not be likely to <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">waste money on bedding if it was
not used.</q> And you can say no more, for the bed of
shavings is an incontrovertible fact; and you can only
remark that you would like to see how they manage
it. With that you are glad to escape, for the place is
dark, damp, and evil smelling; the roof is close down
on the horses' heads, and you are in too close
proximity to the horses' heels to be pleasant.
  <p>This is a middle-class <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">home,</q> and a fair specimen.
Let us look in at one where 130 horses are kept. It
is a mile away, but the surroundings and characteristics are just the same, except that the stables are of
brick, and that a plank hung on two chains separate
the animals, and allows more room for the feet. The
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">bedding,</q> too, instead of being shavings, is of peat,
such as is imported from Ireland and Bohemia-and
very little of that. Being on a larger scale the roof is
higher'; there are windows in this case, but there is
everywhere much unsavouriness and much uncleanliness. The most comfortable place here is the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">hospital,</q>




<pb n=197>



which is situated upstairs above one of the
stables. It is warm and light, and there are roomy
boxes in which the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">sick</q> can be complety isolated
if necessary. In some cases it is so; but in others the
horses have their heads over the half open doors.
These are getting over an attack of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">strangles,</q> which
is something in the nature of quinsy. They are
littered, too, on good straw beds; and there is a
general air of comfort that is in striking contrast
to below-stairs. The ostler, here, is talkative, and
gives some little information about cab horses in
general, as well as those under his own charge. It is
somewhat saddening to learn on such unimpeachable
authority that the life of a cab horse of this class is
little over two years. There are cases in which they
last out four or five; but, as a rule, they soon begin
to <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">fall off</q>-which apparently means going lame or
getting <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">groggy</q> at the knees-and then they are
sold to a smaller cab owner for a night horse, or drop
down into that lowest stratum of all, the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">growler</q>
trade, where they end their existence standing on a
rank, with an occasional whip-up to their best pace as
a fare comes along. And you learn also that a
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">growler</q> is only worked with one horse, the time on
the rank being regarded as equal to a rest in the
stable-while a hansom is always worked with two;
and that whereas as much as &pound;40 or &pound;50 will be
given for a showy horse for a hansom, very few for
growlers realise more than &pound;10, while a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">night
horse</q> the darker sort can often be got for as low
as &pound;6.
  <p>One case of a &pound;6 cab-horse may be cited as a final
instance. It was in the stable of a small cab owner.




<pb n=198>




This man had once been in the oil trade, but having a
fancy for cab-driving, started with a cab of his own.
With this he did so well that he got another cab and
made up his number of horses to five, one being the
six-pounder in question. His stable is in a respectable
looking square in a southern suburb. On entering
the square you see no signs of a cab-yard, but at one
corner there is a gateway leading into a small yard
attached to a private house, and here <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">stabling for
five horses</q>-which on the usual plan means a three-
stall box-has been improvised on the most miniature
plan imaginable, and at the smallest possible cost.
Again no light, no air, no room to move a muscle, and
two of the walls running down with water close to the
head of one of the horses. One of the other animals
had a sore under the collar, another was lame, and
the six pounder was being trotted round the square,
having been stopped and reported when out on a night
turn the previous day. The animal was built on the
most eccentric principle, his legs being long, thin, and
corkscrewy. The fore legs were so weak that the
animal could scarcely stand steady on them; there
were several notable malformations, and yet, though
his action was grotesque, he galloped with considerable
fire. He was altogether a most comical looking
animal. However, it was not a case for a prosecution,
and so he was taken back into his narrow box in the
dark and dismal stable in which he spends his days,
the appearance of the unfortunate beast being so much
against him that no one would hire him if he was seen.
Curiously enough, it was in this wretched little stable
that the first straw bed had been seen, and this led to
the discovery of the anomalous state of affairs that








<pb n=199>



the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">little men</q> exclusively and distinctly give their
horses straw  to lie on, while the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">big men</q> use
shavings or peat. Why this should be so it seems
impossible to explain. It is one of the anomalies of
a trade which does not bear too close a scrutiny, if
one has any sympathy for animals, and shows on the
whole a lamentable disregard for the truth of the
old proverb that a merciful man is merciful to his
beast.
  <p>It is just the same wherever you go. Any place
is good enough for a stable if you can only get the
horse into it, and back him out without barking off too
much skin. To leave room enough for him to be
turned round in would be a great waste of space,
while in the matter of light and air the general
impression seems to be that they are luxuries which
no cab horse requires. No wonder many of them are
restive and nervous in the brilliant light and bustle
of the streets at night after being closely mewed up
in such places as these all day. But this is a matter
that does not come under the cognisance of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It
has to do only with brutality, and not this kind of
torture.  The sanitary officers might, however, inter-
vene in many cases, if not in the interests of the
horses, at all events, in the interests of the people who
live in close proximity to them.

<HEAD>A Curious London Society.</HEAD>

   <p>The latest hobby is the collection of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">book
plates,</q> or what on of its devotees has called <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">their
jargon equivalent-Ex-Libris.</q>  The collection of
these things has not yet, reached the dignity of a
special name, like Philately, but it has a literature of
its own, including a monthly publication; it has a
special society for its cultivation, which has recently
celebrated the first anniversary of its birth; and it has
a nomenclature or <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">jargon</q> peculiar to itself. It
should be stated at once, for the benefit of the
uninitiated, that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">book-plates</q> do not mean the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">plates,</q> as commonly so called, which appear in
books.  It is not the collection of illustrations, or
pictures, but of the devices which owners of libraries,
private and public, have been in the habit for some
generations of pasting inside the covers of their books
as a sign of ownership. It will doubtless be a surprise
to many to know that these have not only their
heraldic interest, but that they have so lent themselves to symbolism and allegory that the best artists
of the past and present have not scrupled to devote
time and attention to their design.  Many have,
therefore, an artistic value, and the connoisseur in such
conceits is rewarded for his pains by securing what
are really things of beauty which all admire.
  <p>The chairman of the Ex-Libris Society for <datestruct value="1893--"><year>1893</year></datestruct>
was Mr James Roberts Brown, F.R.G.S., who is also





<pb n=201>



a leading member and ex-president of the Society of
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Odd Volumes,</q> and the son of the well-known John
Brown, the Arctic chronicler. I called upon him at
his home at South Kensington, and being ushered into
the library, found myself in a perfect museum of book-
plates. There were specimens on the walls framed
and glazed; others packed away in drawers, others
by hundreds and thousands pasted in books, and
all duly classified; for book-plates have their
periods and fashions, and can be divided and
sub-divided to the taste of the collector. There were
rows upon rows of books, dealing with the subject; in
English, French, German, and Swedish, for the hobby
is Continental as well as British; and so much has
been written and reproduced on the subject that
it has its own bibliography, Mr. H. W. Fincham and
Mr. Brown having collaborated in producing a very
useful reference book to the literature extant in these
four countries. Mr. Brown is a thorough enthusiast,
and makes a special study of his hobby from the
heraldic point of view. Given a book-plate that has
no name on it, he traces its owner by means of its
heraldic devices. In this way he discovered that a
book, for which he gave twopence at an old bookstall,
had belonged to Mr. George Tennyson, the grandfather of the late Lord Tennyson, and he retards this
as one of the most precious things in his huge
collection.
  <p>Asked as to his connection with book-plate collecting, Mr. Brown wished it to be made clear that though
the taste for collecting these things is new, the subject
has been for many years a source of study. He had
himself been interested in it for about a quarter of a

<pb n=202>
century. Nor was-it, he explained, the mere acquisition of prints that are valuable only because of their
scarcity.  A representative collection showed the
progress of what is undoubtedly the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">art</q> of book-
plate engraving, for in the olden days they were
printed from plates engraved direct on the metal with
an etching needle with much artistic elaboration. Of
late years cheap plates were produced by <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">process</q>
work with the aid of photography, but artists of
repute would still spend much time in designing and
engraving them. As instances, he showed specimens
of the work of Mr. Stacey Marks. Our best engraver
of book-plate at the present day, he said, is Mr.
Charles William Sherborne, whose productions are as
artistic in design and dainty in finish and effect as
anything ever produced. Then, again, there are well
marked changes of fashion, very interesting to trace
and classify. There is the Jacobean style, in which
the shield, or coat of arms, or crest is surrounded by
heavy scroll work of a most elaborate nature. It is
naturally difficult to fix exact dates, but this flourished
between about <datestruct value="1690--"><year>1690</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="170--"><year>1730</year></datestruct>. Then came in vogue
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Chippendale,</q> floreated patterns of a light, airy,
and graceful style, forming a distinct contrast to the
Jacobean. It takes its name from the Chippendale
furniture, as being light and fanciful in design, and
was copied from the French in the time of Louis
Quatorze.  The style remained in vogue to about
<datestruct value="1790--"><year>1790</year></datestruct>, when it gave place to what is known as the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ribbon and wreath,</q> the motto being printed on
a ribbon, and surmounted by festoons or wreaths of
flowers and foliage.
  <p>There were other styles which did not come within
either category, because not of general application.



<pb n=203>



Military men affected trophies, with cannons and arms,
and accoutrements of all kinds. Artists would adopt
the pictorial, with little landscapes; literary men
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">book piles;</q> and knights a peculiar style,
their coat of arms being hung on a tree.  Very
few people, added Mr. Brown, seemed to know of
the origin of this.  It arose from  the fact that
the knights of old, and the Crusaders also,
used to hang their arms on a tree as a chal-
lenge, and the touching of them  with the point
of a sword or lance meant the acceptance of
the challenge.  There is a humorous allusion to
this practice in <title>Bombastes Furioso,</title> where the
burlesque hero hangs his boots upon the tree and
declares that <quote>Whoever shall these boots displace
must meet Bombastes face to face.</quote> The idea on the
book-plate thus engraved doubtless was a challenge
to the effect that there was the owner's coat of arms
suspended to the tree, and he dared anyone to dispute
his right to bear them. Like everything else book-
plate engraving had its period of decadence. Though
it never fell into disuse, for a long period in the early
part of the present century the book-plates were of a
very plain character, consisting solely of the coat of
arms without any embellishment or ornamentations;
but of late years more fanciful designs have come into
vogue; and very interesting specimens are to be procured. One of these is from the plate presented by
Lord Northbourne to Mr. Galdstone on his Golden
Wedding. This was designed by Mr. Erat Harrison,
and was quite an artistic production. One of Mr.
Sherborn's, too, a library exterior, is exhibited in the
Painter-Etchers' Exhibition, and is generally admired.






<pb n=204>
  <p>A point on which Mr Brown is anxious to vindicate
the reputation of devotees of Ex-Libris is the idea
that book-plate collectors are book destroyers. It
seems to be thought by some that they destroy valu-
able books for the sake of the plates, That vandalism.
however, he declared, is not to be laid to their charge.
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Here, for instance,</q> he went on to say, picking up
an old and battered volume, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">is a book. I should not
dream of taking out that book-plate. That is a book
by Moehsen, a German author; a very celebrated
book with the author's book-plate in it, and bears his
coat of arms outside on the cover. A man would be
an idiot to take that out.</q> Book-plates are collected
for their artistic, historic, and heraldic value; and
among the collectors are to be numbered men of
culture and social position, There are Mr. A. W.
Franks, C.B., of the British Museum, who has one of
the largest-if not the largest-collection extant;
the Hon. Gerald Ponsonby, who may be called the
pioneer of the new hobby; Mr. T. Day, High Sheriff
of Cork ; Ulster King of Arms (Mr. Vicars) ; Mr W.
Hamilton; the Rev. T. W. Carson, of Dublin; Miss
Chamberlayne; and a host of others. So widespread,
indeed, has been the fame of book-plate collecting
that an invitation was received from Chicago for
a representative collection to be sent over to the
World's Fair.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=36>
<HEAD>Doomed City Churches.</HEAD>
  <p>The information of an Association for the Preservation of the City Churches may take many by surprise.
For years they have been a by-word and a jest.
Stories are always current of congregations of one
listening to a service droned out in a perfunctory
manner; and those unacquainted with the real state
of affairs may have supposed that the churches are
only tolerated on account of their historical, achitectural, or antiquarian interest. That among the fifty-
four churches within the city boundaries there are
a few in which the congregations are of the scantiest
cannot be denied. But that this is due to the
churches not being wanted is open to argument.
There are several notable instances-All Hallowes
Barking, for example-where once empty churches
have now large congregations, and are active centres
of Church work. It is equally indisputable that many
are largely attended, not only on Sundays, but on
week-days. Church work in the City is by no means
at a low ebb, and the formation of an association for
the preservation of such of the remaining Churches as
can be saved is a sign of its activity.
  <p>That all the City Churches can be saved is not
anticipated. Three are doomed beyond redemption.
So helpless is their condition that the Association
even with all its new-born zeal, does not intend to
stretch out a helping hand to save them from being





<pb n=206>






demolished, though it would keep a watchful eye over
the funds attached to them. One of these is All
Hallows, the Great with the Less, in Upper Thames
Street, which was built by Wren in <datestruct value="1683--"><year>1683</year></datestruct>. Although
the Church still stands, the tower, which was simple,
but of good and pleasing proportions, was taken down
some years ago to make room for traffic. According
to Pepys, it was one of the first Churches to set up
the King's Arms, even before General Monk had
decided on the Restoration. It was a fine and well-
built Church-like all Wren's work, built for eternity
-but the foundations have been so undermined by
successive street improvements that, already partly
dismantled, it only awaits the completion of the work
of demolition by the contractor's men. Then there
is St. Michael's Bassishaw, another of the Churches
re-built by Wren in <datestruct value="1676--"><year>1676</year></datestruct>, and one of the many he
built with lead spire and lantern. The third is that
of St. George's, Botolph Lane, the tower of which,
though among the simpler class of those designed by
Wren, is considered one of his best. I called on Mr.
C. Talbot Rotherham, who is one of the most active
promoters of the Association, and was informed, with
reference to these Churches, that the Association did
not contemplate the spending of large sums of money
on them. It would cost at least &pound;6,000 each to put
the two last-mentioned churches in repair, and it
would be ridiculous to spend so much. Wherever it
was proved that a church was unsafe, let it come
down.
  <p>Asked for some details of churches that had
already been pulled down, and of others which it was
proposed to demolish, Mr Rotherham pointed out









<pb n=207>



that this was not the first time a society for the
preservation of City Churches had been in existence.
There was one fourteen years ago, when some fine
old churches were pulled down in a rather wholesale
manner for the purpose of widening thoroughfares
and for other public improvements. There were at
least four-St Benet Fink, St. Michael's, Crooked
Lane; St. Christopher-le-Stocks, and St. Bartholomew
by the Exchange-pulled down for the purpose
of widening the thoroughfares round the Royal
Exchange. One only of these was rebuilt.  It is
now in Moor Lane-St. Bartholomew's. This was
before the Act which was passed in <datestruct value="1860--"><year>1860</year></datestruct> for the
union of the City benefices. This Act was passed to
enable City Churches to be pulled down, and the site
sold, wherever a majority of the parishioners agreed
to that course, the ostensible object being to rebuild
them  elsewhere.  Under this Act at least fifteen
Churches have been demolished. These include St.
Benet Gracechurch; St. Dionis Backchurch; St. Mary
Somerset; St. Mildred Poultry (the monuments were
removed to St. Olave's, Jewry, which in its turn was
pulled down): St. Martin Outwich ; St. James's,
Duke's Place; St. Antholin; St. Michael, Queen-
hithe; All Hallows, Bread Street; All Hallows
Staining; St. Matthew, Friday Street; and St.
Thomas, in the Liberty of the Rolls.  St. Mary
Magdalen, Old Fish Street, was burned down, and
though it could have been rebuilt out of the
insurance money, this was never done. The first
so destroyed was St. Benet's, Gracechurch Street, and
that was re-erected in Mile End Road, but, although
there was a gross value in church and site of &pound;36,650,





<pb n=208>






only &pound;15,000 was used for a new church, a sum
sufficient to build and endow it. This is one of the
points the new association is going to make; that on
the destruction of a City Church, the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners do not use all the money in providing
new churches elsewhere, but keep large sums in
reserve. Taking nine churches at random out of the
list of those pulled down under the Union of
Benefices Act, there was an estimated gross total of
&pound;280,000, but the sales produced only &pound;133,719 for
the building of twelve churches in other districts, some
of which were not endowed at all, and others required
more funds. In one case, &pound;33,000 was held in reserve
by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners; in another case
&pound;28,000, and in yet another &pound;15,000.
  <p>Comparatively recently St. Edmund's was scheduled, but on a meeting of the parishioners being
called there was not a single vote in favour of its
demolition, so that this fine old church is preserved
for some time longer, and is one of those which will
be looked after by the new Association. It also is
one of Wren's churches, and is one of those with lead
spires and lanterns. The lantern, which is octagonal,
is ornamented with lighted urns or flaming torches
at each angle, emblematical of the great fire. A
concave octagonal spire rises above the lantern,
forming a very graceful outline. The next to be
scheduled was All Hallows, Lombard Street, one of
the thirteen churches that were built with a tower.
The fate of this is not vet decided. But the church
of the greatest historical interest which it has been
proposed to doom to demolition is St. Etherburga's,
Bishopsgate, one of the ante-fire churches. It is a






<pb n=209>



fine old church, dedicated to the saintly daughter of
Ethelbert, King of Kent, and contains, besides some
early English masonry, some good old stained glass.
Though in existence before <datestruct value="1366--"><year>1366</year></datestruct>, it is in a wonderfully
good state of repair, and the Rector is one of the
strongest opponents of its demolition. Then there is
St. Dunstan's in the East, which has been described
as being a good example of how Wren caught the
Gothic feeling without having the knowledge of
detail necessary for carrying it out with purity. The
steeple is extremely well proportioned, light and
graceful, and, though very fragile looking, was one of
the strongest he built. There has been some talk
of pulling down the church, and leaving the steeple,
as was done in the case of St. Mary Somerset. The
parishioners, however, have vetoed the idea, and the
church still remains. One other church, the continued
existence of which has been attacked several times, is
St. Margaret Pattens, in Rood Lane; but the Rev. J.
L. Fish, the Rector, has always strongly opposed its
removal.  The tower and spire are interesting
specimens of Wren's work, showing that he could
adopt the simple Gothic form and translate it into
classic without loss of grace or power. Then, again,
there is the Church of St. Catherine Coleman, which
is in the charge of Bishop Wilkinson. The work is
done by a Curate, who, unfortunately, is obliged to
live out of the parish, owing to the Rectory being
uninhabitable. Otherwise there is no reason why a
large congregation should not be built up here, as
was done by Canon Mason at the once empty Church
of All Hallows Barking.




<pb n=210>




  <p>This exhausts the list of what may be termed the
doomed Churches of the City, but, as Mr. Rotherham
was careful to point out, it is impossible to tell when
some other may be scheduled. It is this fear that has
caused the new Association to spring into existence.
Its object is to prevent the destruction of any Church
that can be kept in repair at a reasonable cost; not
only on the ground of their architectural and antiquarian interest, but because Churches are actually
useful. Mr. Rotherham goes so far as to say that
where there are scanty congregations it is the fault of
the clergy, and he justifies this assertion by instancing
cases where nearly empty Churches have been filled.
He also argues that the cases of small congregations
have been greatly exaggerated. However this may
be, the Association will go to work in no half-hearted
manner; and in future a very good case indeed will
have to be made out against a City Church before it
is allowed to be demolished or turned to secular uses.

<HEAD>The Chiel in Parliament.</HEAD>
  <p>In two or three months Parliament will again be in
session, and what has come to be known as the silly
season will be over in earnest. There will be little room
for the wonderful stories from afar which during the
dearth of home news are found useful in filling up
the columns of daily papers. In their place will be
the long columns of speeches which, if a little more
prosy, will come as a relief to much exciting literature,
and the speeches of the coming session will be looked
for with curious interest, not only by partisan and
politician, but by all who take any interest at all in
the affairs of their country. The boys who shout the
evening papers will take their catch cries from the
Parliamentary reports ; so once again will proof be
furnished that when on the <datestruct value="1738-04-132"><day type=number>13th</day> <month>April</month>, <year>1738</year></datestruct>, Sir
William Yonge in his place in Parliament exhorted
the House to put an end to the system of Parliamentary reporting then growing up, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">or you may
soon expect to see your votes, your proceedings, and
your speeches printed and hawked about the streets,
while we are sitting in this House,</q> he was giving
utterance not only to a flourish of oratory, but to a
prophecy of what was to be realised something less
than a century later.
   <p>In these days, when a speech is no sooner made
than it is in print, it is curious to glance back to Sir
William Yonge's then effective tirade against the



<pb n=212>




impudent presumption of persons in daring to publish
the utterances of members, who, as Mr. Pelteney
(afterwards Earl of Bath) put it, could not be so
guarded in their expressions as to wish to see everything they said in the House put into print. Curious
is it to recall the shifts and expedients of the reporters
of those days who carried on the hazardous enterprise to which even the thundering edicts of the
House could only put a temporary check. They got
admission by stealth and had to rely on their
memories, to which, no doubt, they often called the
aid of imagination. Unpleasant, indeed, must have
been their long waits at the doors of the public
gallery where they had to take up their positions
early in the forenoon, and, after standing for many
hours, to depend for their chance of getting in upon
a struggle with their competitors in the crowd when
the door was opened. Naturally enough, speeches
obtained in this manner could never be given with the
fullness and accuracy of modern reports. It was not
surprising to read of Sir Horace Walpole complaining, with a mixture of sly humour and assumed
gravity, that he had been made to speak the very
reverse of what he had meant to say; and that he had
read other debates in which all the wit, the learning,
and the argument had been thrown into one side, and
on the other nothing but what was low, mean, and
ridiculous ; and yet when it came to the question, the
division had gone against the side which on the face of
it had reason and justice to support it.
  <p>In an out-of-date print, an amusing story is told of
how, nearly a hundred years ago, there was a dark
closet at the end of the public gallery in which the





<pb n=213>



  more experienced of the reporters used to hide during
a division, in order to be ready for the rush when
  strangers were re-admitted. In this three were on one
  occasion snugly esconced; and, as the period of exclusion was long, they beguiled it by political
  discussion. At last one of them in the heat of argument
  roared out, to the dismay of the Speaker and the
  horror of the sergeant-at-arms, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">I say your paper is
  in the pay of the French Directory.</q> The culprits
  were brought to the Bar of the House, and a strict
  watch was kept for the future on the place of refuge.
  They were not the only persons brought before the
  bar for publishing speeches, for in <datestruct value="1771--"><year>1771</year></datestruct> two publishers
  were proceeded against, and debates on the subject
  of Parliamentary reporting took place which are
  described as being <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">violent beyond all precedent;</q>
  and when, on six others being ordered into custody,
  the City magistrates (one of whom was the Lord
  Mayor) refused to commit them, the magistrates
  themselves were sent to the Tower by order of the
  House.
  <p>If the public has reason to be gratified at the
  change that has been wrought, it is doubtful if some
  of the members altogether appreciate it. To impugn
  the accuracy of a report some year or two after it has
  appeared in print is always considered a lame excuse;
  and the politician often finds himself awkwardly fixed
  when some insignificant individual, with a retentive
memory, or a well-indexed book of cuttings, confronts
him with a forgotten speech. These dilemmas are, of
course, to be got over, as we are constantly reminded,
by the exercise of a little word torturing; but in the
pre-Johnsonian era members could entirely ignore all






<pb n=214>







reference to the debates. Not only were they of the
most meagre description, but the names of the
speakers were only indicated by letters. Often there
was no attempt to record single speeches, all that
appeared being a summary of the discussion, divided
into what the compiler designated the argument, the
answer, and the reply. Johnson, with his mighty
intellect, saw the weakness of this system, and
improved on it to the extent of giving entirely fictional
reports <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">all out of his own head.</q> Boswell throws a
lurid light on how Johnson reported Parliamentary
speeches when, on a specially vehement edict having
been issued by Parliament, he was engaged to write
the reports under the title of <title>The Debates in the
Senate of Lilliput.</title> Though there are some who
doubt if Johnson was as wholesale a fabricator as he
made himself out to be, there is little room to doubt
that he must have surprised the speakers by the
speeches he wrote from the bare facts given him by
Guthrie, who used to go and hear the speeches and
to make a mental note of names and order of precedence, leaving Johnson to fill in the verbiage. A
wonderful contrast is presented in the march of
events-Johnson sitting in his favourite coffee shop
inditing speeches <emph>pro</emph> and <emph>con.</emph>, and the array of reporting force that is to be seen now-a-days on any
night when the Commons are sitting. What a sight
to have seen him struggling with an hour and forty
minutes speech by Mr. Gladstone, or with one of Lord
Beaconsfield's famous sentences, at second hand from
the gentleman with the memory!
  <p>The change has come about, however, without the
result predicted by Sir Thomas Winnington, that the






<pb n=215>



House would be looked upon as the most contemptible assembly on the face of the earth. No longer do
members disdain to do anything that might look like
an appeal to their constituents from their place in
Parliament. On the contrary, members are often
accused of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">playing to the gallery,</q> and it is a matter
of common notoriety that many speeches are delivered
-by country M.P.'s especially-solely to be reported
in the local papers. They are made to empty benches,
and a fair copy, with plenty of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">applause,</q> <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">hear,
hear,</q> and so on dotted about, is sent <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">with compliments</q> to the editor of the local paper, or his
representative in the gallery. It has even happened that
speeches so sent have been printed without having
been delivered, the convenient opportunity not having
arisen. If the gentlemen who were so energetic in
their denunciations of the feeble attempts of the
reporters of their day could once again revisit <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the
glimpses of the moon</q> and find their way into the
House of Commons when a big debate is on next
month, they would stand amazed. No longer is a
single reporter hidden away in the public gallery, or
one or two standing in the crowd on the floor of the
House according to a later practice. Now there is a
gallery specially reserved, numerous writing rooms
for the transcription of the reports, special dining,
smoking, and reading rooms, a separate bar, kitchen,
and attendants for the accommodation of those whose
predecessors, a little more than a century ago, could
not be sufficiently vilified. How much more amazed,
too, would they be to find the elaborate systems of
telephone and telegraph instruments by which the
speeches of members are wired to all pasts of the






<pb n=216>



kingdom within a few minutes of their delivery, and
to realise that they have been true prophets at all
events as regards the pertinacity and enterprise of the
Press. With the multiplication of newspapers, and
consequent competition has come a demand for full
and adequate reports of all debates, as well as spicy
summaries, and descriptions with running commen-
taries, to say nothing of the political forecasts and
tit-bits of information picked up by <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">our own correspondent</q> in the lobby. What would Sir William and
Sir Thomas say at finding not only some 200 reporters and commentators with a special portion of
the House, in which no other being save the janitors
and servants are privileged to enter, but also representatives of almost every paper of importance button-
holing them as they take a sandwich and glass of
wine at the lobby bars ?
  <p>Parliament has altered, and the Press has altered;
but it is doubtful if the character of the speeches has
altered in equal proportion. Points of difference have
been pointed out over and over again between the
Parliamentary eloquence of to-day, and the scholarly
speeches of the past; but with the Irish members in
the House, and with jocular Sir Wilfred Lawson and
his imitators present, it will still be open to any
journal to reproduce the main point in the advertisement printed in the <title>Dublin Mercury</title> of
<datestruct value="1771-01-01"><day type=number>1st</day> <month>January,</month>
<year>1771</year></datestruct>, in which the proprietors announced that they
had opened for their readers <quote>a new source of entertainment</quote> in the <quote>real English Parliamentary debates.</quote>
Reporters, though technically only present on suffrage,
and still ranking as strangers, have now an established


<pb n=217>

place in the gallery, and the day may never come
again when a member will call the attention of the
Speaker to the fact that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo"> A chiel's among ye takin'

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=38>
<HEAD>The Last of Astley's.</HEAD>
   <p>Astley's Amphitheatre, as it is still called-though
 Philip Astley, the rider, to whom it owes name and
 origin, has slept in Pere la Chaise these eighty years
 -has come down. The <foreign lang=la>fiat</foreign> went forth, and another
 old London institution, which has been a landmark
 for a century or more, has ceased to exist.  An
 interesting story is called to mind by this announcement.  The circus has always had more or less
 of a fascination for children of all ages; and Philip
 Astley, whose life had something of romance in it,
 was a prince among circus proprietors. The building,
 too, has an eventful history.
   <p>Philip Astley took to circus-riding by a process of
natural selection, or perhaps, adaption to environment
would be more correct. He was not apprenticed to it
in days of babyhood, and made to suffer terrible
torments, but adopted it of his own free will late in
life. He was born at Newcastle in <datestruct value="1742--"><year>1742</year></datestruct>. When he
grew to years of discretion, not liking the trade of
cabinetmaking, into which he was born, he came to
London, where he enlisted in the 15th, or Elliot's
Own, Light Horse. He was just the man for a horse-
soldier-six feet in his stockings, of handsome
presence, agreeable in manners, and imposing build.
He had, too, a great liking for horses, and soon
became so expert an equestrian that he was installed
as rough rider, teacher and breaker-in of horses in the






<pb n=219>



Regiment. In this way he served his seven years,
and then left with the good will of his comrades. His
commander, General Elliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield), whose respect he had also won, presented him
with a very fine horse in addition to his very best
wishes.
  <p>With this horse, an exceptionally fine charger, and
another which he bought in Smithfield, Ashley
resolved to adopt equestrianism as a profession. It
was not a large stock-in-trade for a circus proprietor,
but he had plenty of faith in his own ability. His
funds did not permit of his having a building-they
did not even run to a tent; but vacant land was
plentiful on the Surrey side then, and he pitched his
ring of ropes and stakes on a waste patch hard by
where the amphitheatre awaits destruction. Where
now all is brick and mortar was then St. George's
Fields, through which the New Cut ran from
Westminster towards Blackfriars, and to which a
curious footpath known as the Halfpenny Hatch led
from St. John's Church in the Waterloo Road. Here
his first performances were given, with the aid of a
drum, two fifes, and a clown; a modest charge of
sixpence being made for the front standing places.
Primitive as were the arrangements, Astley soon
attracted good audiences, and was able to add to the
programme other performances, such as conjuring,
transparencies, vaulting and tumbling, with displays
of fireworks thrown in. In course of time he was
enabled to hire an enclosed area, and to erect seats
under a substantial roof. This was in what was then
a timber-yard, on the site of the present building, and
here his performances were given with great success.







<pb n=220>







There are two water-colour drawings in the British
Museum which depict Astley's at about this period of
its existence. They originally formed part of the
Stowe collection. At first this, too, had but a rope
ring, and the performance only took place in the
morning, for want of artificial illumination; Astley, in
order to waste no time, having an evening entertainment in Piccadilly, with a trained horse and other
items. From tenant of the place at Westminster he
soon became proprietor for what seems now the small
sum of &pound;200.
  <p>His acquisition of this place occurred rather
curiously. Having lent his landlord &pound;200 on a mortgage, the man at once disappeared, leaving Astley to
foreclose at his leisure. This he did, and at once sold
off the wood remaining in the yard. With this money
increased, according to Timbs, by &pound;60, the produce of
a diamond ring he picked up at the foot of Westminster Bridge, he in <datestruct value="1780--"><year>1780</year></datestruct> erected a roofed building,
with adequate seating accommodation, and a more
suitable ring.  This he called the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Amphitheatre
Riding House.</q> Some of the materials of which it
was built he bought cheap, it having formed the huge
hustings built in front of St. Paul's, Covent Garden,
for a famous Westminster election. The place was
now on the road to fortune. The performances, given
at night under favourable conditions, attracted large
audiences. In four years' time he enlarged it, and
to compete with a rival establishment which had the
advantage of dramatic entertainments arranged by
Charles Dibdin, the song writer, added a stage and
dramatic features also. Curiously enough, he forgot
to get the necessary licence, and spent some time in





<pb n=221>



gaol in consequence; but through Lord Chancellor
Thurlow, whose daughter he taught to ride, he procured both release and pardon. The place was at
this time called the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Royal Grove,</q> in consequence of
the interior decorations being in imitation of a grove.
It was here that, according to Walpole, Astley
<quote>ventured his neck by dancing a minuet on three
horses at full gallop with the grace of an Apollo
Belvedere.</quote>  He at the same time had a circus in
Paris, and showed considerable enterprise in starting
theatres and circuses in various parts of the country.
His successes were, however, not to pass unchecked.
His Paris building was seized during the Revolution
and turned into barracks, and at home his building
was involved in a great fire which destroyed nineteen
houses in addition. Unfortunately it was insured for
a very small amount, and in rebuilding it he used
cheap materials, which resulted some years afterwards
in its complete destruction in the short space of two
hours.
  <p>Before this second conflagration occurred, however,
Astley had died in Paris in <datestruct value="1814--"><year>1814</year></datestruct>, at the age of 72, in
the same house, chamber, and bed in which his father
had breathed his last. His had been a busy life.
Altogether he built 19 theatres and amphitheatres, the
last of which was the Olympic Pavilion, in Wych-street, which was originally erected for equestrian
performances. This, too, was destroyed by fire, but
not until after he had parted with it. The Westminster
building had passed to Andrew Ducrow, whose father,
a native of the Borough, had been engaged by Astley
years before as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The Flemish Hercules.</q> It was
during Ducrow's ownership that the second fire





<pb n=222>
occurred, to be followed by the tragic death of Ducrow
himself, through mental derangement and paralysis
brought on by the catastrophe. Since that time,
<datestruct value="1841--"><year>1841</year></datestruct>, the Amphitheatre has passed through the hands
of Batty and W. Cooke-both names well known in
connection with circuses; of Dion Boucicault, who
turned it into the Theatre Royal, Westminster ; of
Mr. E. T. Smith, and finally of Mr. George Sanger, in
whose possession it has since remained, and under
whose management it revived some of its old glories.
Throughout these vicissitudes, despite many rechristenings and no little alteration, it has always
retained the name of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Astley's</q> in the minds and
memories of cockneys and country cousins alike-a
fact which is the best possible tribute to the powerful
personality of its originator.

<HEAD>The Last of Clement's Inn.</HEAD>



  <p>With the demolition of St. Clement's Inn another
of the Old Inns of Chancery will cease to exist.
Lyon's Inn was razed to make room for the Globe
Theatre; St. Clement's is to give place to more of the
palatial <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">mansions</q> which are springing up on all
hands. There is this in common with both Inns, that
they outlived their original purpose, and after a lingering after-life as tenements, have passed into the hands
of the builder, unwept and unhonoured, if not alto-
gether unsung. Both have had associations calculated
to perpetuate their memories. Lyon's Inn was associated with the still quoted Thurtell-Weare tragedy;
St. Clement's, not altogether free from tragic connections, will in the future be principally, if not solely,
remembered by reason of its introduction into one of
Shakespeare's plays. It was here Falstaff heard the
chimes at midnight-the chimes that are heard still,
though <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">grown hoarse with age and sitting up.</q> Here,
too, Shallow earned the prefix <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">mad</q> by his pranks
with the curiously-named trio Doit, Pickbone, and
Squele. Antiquarians will not care much about its
removal, because, with the exception of the old and
somewhat ornate hall, dating back to <datestruct value="1715--"><year>1715</year></datestruct>, where
many generations of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ancients</q> and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">principals</q>
dined royally on the profits of the rents-the buildings
are modern and dingy. True, the gardens have been
well-kept; and have been an acceptable oasis in a







<pb n=224>







desert of brick and mortar; but once having started
on the down-hill cf life, the Inn was sure to deteriorate,
and it would have been a pity for it to have emulated
the condition to which Lyon's Inn sank. Still are
ringing in the ears of many the outcry against its
condition some years ago. The criticism was doubtless largely undeserved, but with its lordly Tuscan
hall, oak panelled and glazed with stained glass
windows, given over to printer's ink and the ceaseless
roll of machinery; with chambers once sacred to the
study of the law to the first comer; and its gardens a
playground for the denizens of Clare Market, its complete decay was beyond a doubt.
  <p>The breaking-up of St. Clement's as an Inn commenced a few years ago, when the society sold it for
&pound;68,000, and divided the proceeds among them. Then
it was that the valuable paintings of legal celebrities
were sold at a private auction, to which <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ancients</q>
and <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">moderns</q> were invited, but from which the
public were excluded. The residents certainly made
a good bargain; and it must be admitted to have
been a curious state of affairs that simple residence,
without initial payment of any kind, should have
given a right to the proceeds of such a valuable
place. Who first endowed it is a matter of doubt.
What can be said is that the new resident found
the place under the management of those living
there, who, after a lapse of years, were denominated <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">ancients.</q> They elected their <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">principal,</q>
collected the rents, and after paying expenses
spent the rest in dinners, of which there were a
certain number each year.  When they sold the
premises by mutual consent they divided the money


<pb n=225>



according to seniority, and there was no one to say
them nay. A very happy and satisfactory state of
things for the residents who, no doubt, further
congratulate themselves in not having been as other
dwellers in cities in that they paid no rates. Exciting
tales are still told of the gallant efforts of sturdy
youths, engaged in beating the bounds every Shrove
Tuesday, to enter the place, and so make it amenable
to the rate collector. But they never succeeded, and
St. Clement's Inn was never rated.
  <p>The curious sun dial, held by a black man, which
at the time of the sale was removed to the Temple
Gardens, has a rather curious history. The residents
at the Inn were always proud of their gardens, and
the time came when they    thought the natural
ornateness of the place would be enhanced by some
sort of a monument. There was no one connected
with the place who could claim a statue; and
considerable difficulty was experienced in choosing a
subject. However, just about that time one of the
residents, who had brought a native servant from
India, was murdered in his chambers by the boy; and
that gave rise to the suggestion that a black boy
should be the chosen subject, and he was doubtless
doomed to the holding up of a sun dial in perpetuity
by way of additional torture.
   <p>The chambers of St. Clement's cannot reveal such
exciting incidents as those with which Mr. Pickwick
was enlivened at the Magpie and Stump; but the
murder by the Indian boy thus perpetuated in bronze
was not the only tragic incident. It is within the
memory of many that when the plans of the present
Law Courts were chosen, Mr. John Brandon, who was


<pb n=226>
second, was so chagrined at his defeat that he
committed suicide in his chambers in the Inn. Beyond
these incidents the place has little history that is
worth reproducing. Its effacement, however, removes
another old land-mark, and will largely contribute
to the complete alteration of an historic part of
London, which commenced with the clearing of the
site of the Law Courts, and which will soon have
little in common with the district known to Dr.
Johnson, whose pew in the adjoining Church is still a
place of pilgrimage; while practically nothing, except
Inigo Jones's Watergate at the foot of Buckingham
Street, remains beyond the names of the streets to
indicate that two centuries ago there stood here the
mansions of the nobility.

<DIV1 TYPE=chapter N=40>

<HEAD>The Last of the Fellowship Porters.</HEAD>
  <p>Driven to recklessness by sheer starvation, the last
of the Fellowship Porters engaged in a struggle
wholly pathetic, and which had dramatic elements.
The last of the Fellowship Porters are three hundred
old men, the youngest over forty, and the average
age over fifty, all Freemen of the City of London, and
members of the now moribund City Company which,
after three centuries of existence, finds itself a lagging
veteran on the stage of commerce. For reasons that
will presently be shown, the Fellowship has been an
entirely superfluous institution for some twenty years.
The members have been deprived of their means of
livelihood, or rather their means of gaining a livelihood have gone from them. Many have drifted into
other employments; sons who would otherwise have
followed the vocation of their fathers, as their fathers
had done before them, have emigrated to other
countries, and there are left three hundred old men
unable to earn money at the work to which they were
accustomed, unfitted to turn their hand to new
employment, and presenting a picture of despair and
wretchedness that is not a little touching.
  <p>These men, with starvation staring them in the face,
homeless and hungry, summoned up courage to beard
the City Corporation. They broke into the rooms at
which the business of the Fellowship was conducted




<pb n=228>







by a City Alderman, his deputy, and three rulers; and
having taken forcible possession of everything, ate and
slept by relays of twenty and thirty in two small
rooms. When I visited them I found a surprising
state of things. The very fine old Hall of the
Company, or Fellowship as it is more generally called,
which is valued at about &pound;20,000, is let to a firm of
fishmongers for a rent of &pound;200 per year; and
accommodation was some years ago found for the
business of the porters in Rose Court. It is not easy
to find Rose Court, for it is the centre of a network of
courts, approached from Beer Lane, which in its turn
leads down Lower Thames Street; but by dint of
asking a policeman or two in the main thoroughfares,
and a porter or two doing outpost duty in the dark
or repellant courts, the rooms of the Fellowship are
found, and are seen to look almost as decayed as the
institution itself. Any idea, originating in the action
of the men, that there would be evidence of violence
was quickly dispelled. There were no barricades, no
armed sentinels, no display of force; but around a
green baize covered table was a party of some twenty
or more men just finishing a very modest supper. The
chair of state, in which the worthy Alderman had sat
so often to direct the business of the Court, was left
untenanted. By its side still stood those emblems of
past dignity, the tall, gold-headed staves which have
so often been carried before the Alderman in the days
when the members marched reverently once every
year to St, Mary-at-Hill to hear a sermon and make
their contributions for the aid of the poor members.
Over the fireplace was the gilded <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">table</q> containing
the names of the members of the Court; in the corner


<pb n=229>



an old grandfather's clock which was formerly in the
hall, and near it an oil painting of Benjamin Bowen, a
deputy governor, painted in remembrance of his
impartial and generous conduct for eighteen years.
One notes these things as evidence of the peaceful
disposition of the men. They have taken possession
of the place, and live and sleep in it; but they have
not made themselves at home in it. Nothing is
disturbed. Even the chairs are arranged around the
table as though for a meeting of the Court, and
everything is orderly, There is a jug of water on the
table, but no sign of anything more stimulating; and
the members forbear to smoke, except in the courtyard outside. The men sit around looking rather
disconsolate. They seem to be wondering how in the
first place they had the temerity to break into the
rooms; and why in the second the Corporation should
have taken no notice of their having done so; for up
to the present they have been left in peaceful posssession of the place.
  <p>Asked how it came to pass that they did so, one of
the youngest of the men said they either had to do it
or sleep on the Embankment. There was not a man
there who had a home to go to, and at all events they
now had lodgings. While some remained on guard,
others went out <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">to look for a shilling,</q> and old
members who had turned their hands to other trades
looked in and gave them little contributions towards
their food. And so they were fairly comfortable.
How long it would last he could not tell, but they had
resolved upon this rather desperate course by way of
airing their wrongs. Over and over again they had
petitioned the Court of Common Council for an





<pb n=236>







inquiry into their claims, but nothing had been done.
There were funds in connection with the Company to
which they considered they had a right, and they had
grievances which they thought should be inquired
into. They had been deprived of their living, and of
the benefits of the Fellowship, to which they had
contributed largely, and the only person who benefited
by the funds remaining, and the small income still
accruing, were officials of the Corporation, whose
services were practically useless.
  <p>To understand the position of the men a little
history of the origin and decadence of the Company
is necessary, and is easily given. Though a reccgnised
City Company it stood on a different footing from
most of the others. Like the parish clerks and watermen, the porters never had the right of making their
members Freemen of London; and in other ways the
fraternity has always been on a lower status than most
of the other Companies. It was originated by an Act
of the Common Council in <datestruct value="1646--"><year>1646</year></datestruct>, and enjoyed for a long
period the exclusive privilege of landing and measuring the grain brought by the boats arriving in the
Thames. It was a valuable monopoly, and membership was exclusive and rather costly. Applicants had
to become Freemen, at a cost of about fifty shillings;
they paid five guineas for election to the Fellowship;
contributed four shillings a year each to the manage-
ment expenses, and a penny out of every shilling
earned. At the time when the membership numbered
3,000 these pennies alone aggregated upwards of
&pound;81,000 a year. So the confraternity grew rich and
prosperous. They erected a large hall; had funds in
hand; and the members were looked upon quite as


<pb n=231>



a superior class of working men. It was the building
of the London Docks that struck the first blow at
their prosperity. Vessels were then taken into the
docks and discharged there, instead of in the river.
The monopoly of the Fellowship Porters was thus
broken through, for they could not control the dock
companies; and the latter preferred to engage their
own men. Then in <datestruct value="1872--"><year>1872</year></datestruct> the Port of London Grain
Bill was passed, by which the porters lost the privilege
of compulsory metage, or corn measurement. The
City gained some new advantages by the change, but
the Fellowship Porters lost all theirs. This Act, the
men say, took the bread from their mouths; but
made no arrangement for winding up the affairs of
the confraternity. They had then a good deal of
money; they had a valuable hall; and they have ever
since continued to pay one penny out of every
shilling they earned, in order to retain their membership. But for this money they say they have had no
return; though they have never ceased to clamour for
a proper winding-up of the Company. The affairs of
the Fellowship have been entirely in the hands of the
Corporation, who have left the members unheeded.
They have-these last of them that remain-slowly
drifted down to the lowest depths of poverty.
  <p>This was the burden of their wrongs. They were
not garrulous over them, but one or two old members
who were asked gave a few pathetic details of their
struggles for life-homes slowly broken up, families
dispersed, and privation borne with much fortitude.
There was something strikingly different in these
men from the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">unemployed</q> one sees on Tower
Hill.  Their demeanour won respect; and their





<pb n=232>
case seemed a thoroughly deserving one. Certainly
no more pathetic sight can be witnessed to-night than
these old men-the last of the Fellowship Porters-
decayed and dejected, holding possession of these
two rooms in Rose Court, in mute protest against an
all powerful Corporation.

<HEAD>The New Record Office.</HEAD>



  <p>The Public Record Office, which contains the
national archives, has surprisingly soon outgrown the
accommodation provided in the substantial Tudoresque building lying between Fetter Lane and
Chancery Lane, which was erected in <datestruct value="1856--"><year>1856</year></datestruct>. Prior to
that date the records of public affairs were distributed
over no fewer than sixty places, and were as inaccessible to the searcher as they were widely scattered.
When at last they were brought together under one
roof in the present building on the Rolls Estate,
which was erected from the designs of Sir J.
Pennethorne, they formed a collection of great size
and greater importance. They had no equal, declared
Sir Francis Palgrave, in the civilised world in antiquity, continuity, variety, extent, and amplitude of
facts-containing, in fact, full materials for the history
of the country, civil, religious, political, social, moral,
or material, from the date of the commencement of
the Domesday Book to the present day. But the
building, which at the time it was believed would hold
all the records that would accrue for fifty years at the
least, soon grew too small. In twelve years it had to
be enlarged. In forty it has had to be supplemented
by the new building in Chancery Lane, which within
the last few days has been opened up to the view of
passers-by.


<pb n=234>



  <p>The building now in use was a substantial, though
not handsome, structure, partaking too much of the
unrelieved German type; the new building will rank
as one of the architectural features of London. In
due course it will be followed by another block, which
will necessitate the demolition of Rolls House, connecting the new building with the old ; and a further
block will be built on the vacant site in Fetter Lane,
which is now an eyesore to the neighbourhood. There
will then be a complete quadrangle of buildings,
forming a Record Office in every way worthy of the
multifarious and varied collections of papers, books,
and documents deposited within them. The completion of this scheme will take many years. At
present the Office of Works is only concerned with the
Chancery Lane block, which can be distinctly seen
from Fleet Street. Now that the unsightly hoarding
is removed, the facade is visible, and will be generally
admired. It is at present a mere shell. Inside all is
a chaos of ladders and building material. The exterior, however, leaves nothing to be desired. There
is a handsome Gothic doorway flanked by two square
towers, and two large windows above. At the extreme
corners are hexagonal towers, and all the towers have
stone turrets. Altogether the building covers a site
225ft. long and 65ft. wide; and the whole of the work
reflects great credit on Mr. Taylor, Surveyor of Her
Majesty's Works and Public Buildings in London.
  <p>In arranging for the extension of the Record Office,
Mr. Taylor was very much handicapped by the fact
that the present office, designed by Sir J. Pennethorne,
was designed to face a thoroughfare that was never
completed. At that time a project was on foot-indeed


<pb n=235>



was practically decided upon-to construct a new
arterial thoroughfare from Piccadilly Circus cutting
through Long Acre, and, absorbing Carey Street,
leading into the heart of the City, the design being to
relieve the Strand, on the one hand, and Holborn and
Oxford Street, on the other. But the only bit of the
road ever made-unless Coventry Street is included
-is that which fronts the present Record Office.
This accounts for the curious situation of the building,
which seems to have been dropped down hurriedly
in a builder's yard and forgotten. The scheme was
one that could not be revived, for in the meantime
the new Bankruptcy Court had been erected directly
on the line of route. The scheme, therefore, to which
we have alluded, by which with successive blocks of
buildings a perfect quadrangle will ultimately be
formed, was decided upon. This sealed the fate of
Rolls House, a very unpretentious structure, which
has been used as an adjunct of the Record Office,
mainly being used by Mr. Lyte, the deputy-keeper,
and his assistants. This will come down before the
next block is commenced, the few relics in it being
carefully preserved.
  <p>It was at first intended that the Rolls Chapel,
which has been very justly described as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">singularly
ugly and plainly built,</q> should also be removed. But
it has many associations and a rather curious history.
Originally it was a hospital for converted Jews; and
afterwards it was used for the storing of the early
records of the Court of Chancery after they were
removed from the Tower, subsequently becoming the
Rolls Chapel. It was built during the reign of Henry
III., at the King's expense, having then a tower, which





<pb n=236>







disappeared some years ago. The chapel itself, however, was in so good a state of repair that it was
declared to be an act of vandalism to remove it. It
was, therefore, arranged that the north wing should
be carried on arches over the chapel, which will subsequently be used again, as it was for several
generations, for the storing of some of the more important
of the Records.
  <p>In order to avoid danger to the safety of the
records by fire, the most elaborate precautions have
been taken in the new building. Only the smallest
possible quantity of wood has been used. All the
rooms are lined with iron. Doors of iron are provided everywhere. Hydrants and fire-extinguishing
appliances are fitted to every floor ; and there will be
as few fireplaces as possible. Indeed, the latter are
only to be provided in the rooms of the officials,
which will be quite shut off from the store rooms by
iron doors. As far as possible, everything is fireproof,
floors, staircases, &amp;c., being of iron and stone, the roof
of iron, while the windows have stone mullions and
iron lights. In taking this course the Board of Works
is acting on the precept that <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">an earnest and provident fear is the mother of safety.</q> It is in no sense
a case of locking the stable door after the steed is
stolen, for there is no nation in the world whose records
have suffered so little from fire as those of this country,
and though it is only within comparatively recent
years that they have been brought under one roof,
having previously been scattered over various public
offices, they are singularly complete from the date of
the Norman Conquest to the present year. And not
only are they safely stored, but preserved in such a
way that they are readily obtainable by searchers, of





<pb n=237>



whom many every day avail themselves of the opportunity of investigating facts which have long since
become part of the forgotten history of the country.
Musty files of papers are constantly being overhauled
by students, historians, and others. To the casual
visitor these possess no attraction, save exciting a
passing feeling of wonder that they should be worth
the expense of keeping at all. For the mere sightseer,
however, there are contents of perennial interest.
Foremost amongst these are, of course, the Domesday
Books, which, somewhat singularly perhaps, have an
even greater fascination for Americans than for
English people.  The greatest surprise is created
among both by the fact, not generally known, that
there are two Domesday Books-though the singular
number is invariably used in speaking of them. Those
who see them for the first time are also surprised to
find them no larger than an ordinary family Bible. The
various old charters are curious and fairly complete,
though lacking the most important, the <name>Magna Charta,</name> which is in the possession of the British
Museum.    A very interesting one is the charter
creating the first Prince of Wales. Here also are
kept the military and naval dispatches, foremost in
importance among which are those of Marlborough
and Wellington. The department containing royal
letters has been enriched from time to time, and those
of Mary Queen of Scots to Bothwell are most frequently brought to the light of day. It is hoped
that when the new building, now approaching completion, is opened in the autumn, the records will be
reclassified, and made still more easy of access.

<HEAD>The Art and Practice of Disguising.</HEAD>
  <p>The letter written to the Press by Mr. C. H. Fox,
the wig maker, of Russell Street, Covent Garden, in
connection with the recent curious case of masquerading in female attire, might be said to have been
modelled upon the plan of Sam Weller's love letter,
inasmuch as the reader would be sure to wish there
were more of it.  It certainly threw a surprising side
light upon the seamy side of life in modern Babylon;
and seemed to indicate that the writer possessed a
fund of information on every day romances calculated
to make him a covetable companion for tea and
scandal.  A shop in which there is a constant procession of gay Lotharios and bald-headed Benedicts,
the one desiring to be disguised fascinately for
amorous pursuits, and the other unrecognisably,
to satisfy the pangs of jealousy, should be an
inexhaustible storehouse of romance.  And then
the <foreign lang=fr>soupcon</foreign> of tragedy-the occasional murderer
in his daily different disguise, and the crowd of
amateur and professional detectives; the one tripping
upon the heels of the other, and the whole forming a
curious medly of cross purposes, was so promising of
exciting adventure that the letter was really very
tantalising.
  <p>With a view to further open up this treasure-store
of romance I called upon Mr. Fox; and found myself
in a collection of hirsute adornments which was


<pb n=239>



absolutely bewildering.  Mr. Fox was there in the
midst of it all-as imagination might have pictured
him-like a presiding genius ready, as though by a
stroke of magic, to make the young look old, the
old young; the stout thin, and the thin stout.  He
had not copious memoirs in MS. to refer to, nor a
well-kept diary bubbling over with romantic stories,
but he has a memory well-stored with the secrets of
his profession, and, so far as duty to his clients and
the exigencies of prospective business allowed, he was
willing to oblige. As he rattled on for some considerable time as to how the disguising is done, and the
class of customers who patronise him, I soon found
that the glimpse behind the scenes he gave in his
letter was by no means exaggerated.  It was curious
to hear story after story of husbands playing the
amateur detective in the case of errant wives; of old
men who have been playing a conspicuous part in the
old-time domestic drama of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">May and December,</q>
walking into the shop, with the snows of many winters
upon their heads, and leaving with youthful appearance, if not bounding step, to visit gay haunts of
pleasure in search of the erring spouse; coming day
after day to be painted and disguised beyond recognition to play the spy on those they have taken for
better or worse. One of the ways to the Divorce
Court lies through the wig-maker's shop-and the
way to prison too; for the victimised Benedict is not
the only one who avails himself of the disguiser's art.
Mr. Fox had stories to tell of swell mobsmen who-
at the time unknown to him-had availed themselves
of his services; and of employers disguised to watch
their employees  These latter are, it seems, a fruitful






<pb n=240>







source of revenue. Some of the most numerous customers are publicans, who don a disguise to watch
their barmen and barmaids, and, being well up to the
many tricks by which peculation is carried on by
these individuals, the result is frequent discovery.
  <p>One story of the Divorce Court was, perhaps, a fair
sample of the whole, and may be given in his own
words, <quote>There was one case,</quote> he says, <quote>some time
ago of a man who came from Scotland. He came to
me and I disguised him. He did not say what it was
for, and I did not ask him, but went on making him
up day after day. At last he came to me one Sunday
and apologised for disturbing me, saying he thought
it would be the last time he would trouble me.  He
had got all the information he wanted, and was going
to bring matters to a climax.  Having been <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">'made
up,'</q> once again he went away, but he came again next
day and told me the whole story. His wife had come
to town, ostensibly to stay with some friends.  He
had not suspected anything, but a day or two afterwards he found some letters which clearly showed
that she had some love affair on foot.  And so
he followed her to town. On this particular Sunday
he had ascertained that his wife and her lover were
going to Richmond, and he followed them. After
roaming about Richmond they had gone to an inn
there and engaged a private room for dinner.  He
followed them in and soundly thrashed the man. The
curious point of the story was that he forgot he was
disguised, and his wife, not recognising him, threw
herself between them and demanded to know who he
was and why he invaded the privacy of their room.
At first he was dumbfounded at the apparent perfidy


<pb n=241>



of his wife but it suddenly dawned upon him that he
was disguised, and in orthodox tragic manner threw
off his wig and beard, and rubbing his face with his
handkerchief, exclaimed, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">'Wretched woman, I am
your husband</q> --or something equally <foreign lang=fr>apropos</foreign>. The
woman fainted the lover had taken the opportunity
to withdraw, and the deluded husband journeyed
back to London a sadder if not a wiser man. The
sequel to the story was told in the Divorce Court in
Edinburgh, where he got a relief from further marital
obligations.</quote>
  <p>There was one case-of the tragic rather than the
melodramatic order-in which Mr. Fox's experience
was truly sensational. It was during the Whitechapel
murders, when large numbers of persons called to be
disguised.  There were professional detectives and
amateur detectives galore all seeking to have their
identity hidden.  Some were made up as dock
labourers, others as costermongers, but the <foreign lang=la>genus</foreign>
loafer was the most generally patronised as giving
scope for an immense amount of loitering aimlessly
about the streets. How they, metaphorically, trod on
one another's heels, and in more than one case actually
ran one another in as suspects, is matter of ancient
history.  But among the crowd there was one man
who excited the greatest suspicion in the mind of Mr.
Fox.   One cause of it was that he was always very
very particular about having a different disguise.
And then he had a repulsive appearance, and
mysterious ways.  His sinister manner and soft cat-like walk made Mr. Fox come to the conclusion that
he really was Jack the Ripper. So thoroughly did he
believe this that he communicated with the police,







<pb n=242>







and the next time the man arrived to be made up a
communication was sent to Bow Street.  The work
of disguising went on as before; but when the suspect
left a detective was on the watch, and shadowed him
for some days. Nothing, however, could be discovered
about him, further than that he met a stylishly
dressed woman in the City and went with her to
Mentone.  The detective followed them thither, and
hung about Mentone for several days; but as the man
did nothing at all suspicious the detective gave up his
task and returned home.
  <p>Among other cases of which Mr. Fox retains a
vivid remembrance is that of the big robbery of
diamonds which was effected some time ago at the
Midland Hotel. From the description of the men
published afterwards he has not the least doubt he
disguised them, and so unwittingly helped them to
evade the police. In another case, however, his knowledge of disguises aided in bringing a man to justice.
Some one had forged his name to a bill tor &pound;45, and
an arrest was made, but the witnesses could not
identify the accused. Mr. Fox was sent for and seeing
at once that the man had on a false moustache, said
he might identify him if the prisoner would remove
his moustache. The police laughed and talked of
sending for a barber, but he, catching the end of the
moustache with a peculiar jerk, twitched it off, much
to the surprise and amusement of the police, and the
consternation of the man, who was then promptly
identified.
  <p>A curious feature of the disguising business is that
all the customers almost with one accord say it is done
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">for a wager,</q> but the discriminating and practised






<pb n=243>



eye of the disguiser sees through the pretence, though
he wisely holds his peace. It is just the same with
another class of customers, those who go to have black
eyes painted. This is quite a modern art, and it is
not too much to say it has reached perfection. The
number of people who go for this purpose is astonishing; and it is rather curious to hear, that without
exception, they have all <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">run against lampposts.</q> So
deftly is the painting done that in a few minutes and
for an average fee of about half-a-crown the damage
is repaired, so that even on a close scrutiny it is
scarcely perceptible.
  <p>On the subject of the <foreign lang=la>modus operandi</foreign> Mr. Fox was
by no means reticent. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">The only thing you have to
avoid for out-of-door disguises is,</q> he said, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the use of
paint. You start with the eyebrows. These you can
darken or lighten, shave a bit off, or, if they are
arched, draw down the centre and fix it with a little
gum, and draw up the ends and fix those in the same
way. A bit of burned paper makes an excellent
colour for darkening under the eyebrows; it is far
better than paint, because it does not show. In the
same way a little colour on the neck makes it look
thin, and a bit of light colour on what is commonly
called the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">'Adam's Apple'</q> makes that look more
prominent. This and a false moustache or whiskers
and a wig makes anyone unrecognisable.</q>
  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">But surely,</q> I remarked, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">it shows in the open
air?</q>
  <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Oh! no,</q> he replied, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">it is next to impossible if
done carefully. The moustache and whiskers are not
those you see in the show cases made up in imitation
skin. They, of course, would show. The way we do






<pb n=244>







is to smear the skin with gum-a special spirit gum
-and when it is nearly dry we lay on the hair. When
this has stuck the ends are clipped, and it looks
exactly like nature. The real skin shows through,
and only an expert could see that it is false hair.
Then there is the nose. That can be altered with
nose paste, which makes the building up of that
important feature much easier than in the old days
when we used putty, dough, and wool. But even
those were a great improvement upon the even older-
fashioned artificial noses. With a little trouble and
the aid of paint it can be so joined to the face as to
defy detection ; just as in the case of the black eye.
A pair of spectacles and a change of dress, and
identity is completely lost. Of course the great thing
is not to wear anything to attract attention. Made
up to look like a common-place individual-the more
common-place the better-anyone can defy detection,
except, of course, at the hands of an expert and a
professional detective.</q>

<HEAD>The Trickeries of Trade.</HEAD>



  <p>One of the least known but most interesting public
buildings in London is the new    Weights and
Measures Office at Newington.  It is at the back
of the Sessions House, on ground that has lugubrious
associations ; for on this site existed until recently the
famous Horsemonger Lane Prison, where many
notorious malefactors have been executed, and in
which many more celebrated prisoners served part of
their sentences. It was at the execution of the
Mannings here that Dickens saw the hideous scene of
riot which he depicted next day in a letter to the
<title>Times,</title> and which led to the abolition of public
hanging. A remnant of the old building still exists in
Union Street, its great pile of dirty brick outer wall,
unrelieved by a single window, being in striking
contrast to the rather ornate modern building, erected
for the inspectors of weights and measures, which
adjoins it.
  <p>Calling recently on Mr Webb, I 'was shown the
curious museum of false weights and measures
which have been seized at various times, each item
of which tells its story of the trickery of traders.
There are weights carefully hollowed out and the
holes filled with cork, and others made of wood
carefully coloured to look like iron. One is a simple
piece of iron gas piping filled with wood, and with a
ring put through at the top. Painted black it looks





<pb n=246>







wonderfully like a 3lb. weight; but pick it up and it
seems as light as a feather. Scales, too, are made
with detachable pieces, to be removed when an
inspector comes in sight.  Measures have false
bottoms, and sometimes a complete removable inner
measure holding about three-parts of the proper
amount. But these are old and out of date. Few
but street vendors ever rely upon such expedients.
The risk is too great for the shopkeepers, for they are
never safe from a surprise visit by an inspector whom
they may have never seen before. And, though
perhaps they do not know it, the inspectors have
entered up in a book a list of all the weights each
shopkeeper has, with any suspicion against the
establishment carefully jotted down. The inspector
refers to this before making a visit, and often surprises
the shopkeeper by the completeness of his knowledge.
  <p>A look round the museum of curiosities led to an
interesting conversation, in which Mr Webb gave some
detail of the work of the inspectors. They have not
only to deal, he said, with light weights, and scales
that would weigh considerably against the purchaser
according to the part of the scoop in which they were
placed, but they have also to be on the alert against
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">heavy</q> weights. One was pointed out which was
3lbs. too heavy. That came from a marine store
dealer, the advantages of the heaviness of the weight
being obvious. Close by was a pair of scales with a
piece of cord attached to the weight side of the scale
and passing through the counter.  This too, was
from a marine store, the dealer putting his foot on
the cord and holding down the weights until he had










<pb n=247>



piled up the goods on the other side as high as his
conscience allowed him. In this case the weights
had nothing to do with the weighing of the articles he
bought. Many trades have their own separate tricks.
A piece of fat bacon stuck <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">accidentally</q> on the
scale is a common trick in bacon shops. One of the
curiosities in the museum is a knife which was found
inserted under the scoop of a scale, and which led to a
fine of 40s and costs. But against some of the tricks
of traders the inspectors are powerless. Notably is
this the case with the cheap butcher. A poor woman
goes to a shop, sees a piece of meat marked 8d per
lb., and offers 7 1/2lb. The butcher pretends to demur;
then with an <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">here you are, mum-any price you
like,</q> throws it into the shop, remarking, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">weigh this
for the lady at five and four.</q> A butcher never says
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">weigh this at so-much a pound,</q> but at so much a
quarter. The <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">five and four</q> is five shillings and
fourpence a quarter of eight pounds; so that the poor
woman pays the full price originally asked, and not
that which she thought of paying.    It is not
uncommon for the butcher to charge an even higher
price than that at which the meat is marked, trusting
to the customer's want of knowing the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">dodge.</q> The
inspectors, though they know of this being a constant
practice, have no power to interfere. The customer
must take action against the shopkeeper for fraud;
this particular offence not having been contemplated
by the Act.
  <p>Asked if the inspection of weights and scales does
not necessarily develop into a perfunctory business,
because an inspector must get known, Mr Webb
replied that this is by no means the case. Each






<pb n=248>







inspector has a district, and pays periodical visits to
every shop. But occasionally a bevy of unknown
inspectors will flock down on a certain street or
locality, and visit a lot of shops simultaneously, often
making captures in this way. The vehicles in which
they drive about are ingeniously fitted up with every
contrivance for testing weights, scales, and measures.
It is never, however, the practice to drive up to the
shop in it. The inspector walks into the shop, an
assistant stands at the door, and the vehicle is kept as
far away as possible. At a given signal, it is driven
up, and the shopkeeper has no opportunity to hide
anything.
  <p>The tactics adoped with regard to the coal carts are
even more artful. It is not long since the County
Council obtained power to insist on coal being
delivered by weight, and the grossest frauds were
daily perpetrated. Indeed, Mr. Webb remarked, the
demand for new sacks on the part of coal dealers,
when the Act was put into operation, gave a
wonderful impetus to the sack-making trade. Hardly
any of the old sacks were big enough. And not only
were the sacks small, but when a certain number had
been emptied they were filled up again by contribu-
tions levied on the other sacks. To catch a coal
seller <foreign lang=la>in flagrante delicto</foreign> is-quite a work of art. He
must be caught in the very act of selling, and the
County Council weighing machine must be at hand to
weigh the coal. There is no seizing the coal and
taking it away to weigh. It might be of right weight.
So the officials have a big set of scales artfully concealed in a vehicle which is something in appearance
between a baker's cart and a pianoforte dealer's


<pb n=249>

wagon, made to open out and be ready to work in an
instant. It has necessarily a peculiar appearance, and
would soon be known, so it has to be kept out of
sight. An inspector, disguised as a nonentity, takes
up his stand at the street corner in a neglected district,
and watches for his prey.  A coal cart comes along.
He has to follow unnoticed, watch until a customer is
procured, signal to his assistant with the weighing
cart, and stop the coal man with the sack on his back
just as his vehicle drives up. The sack is weighed.
If it is the right weight, that is all right; the inspector
has not exceeded his duty. If the weight is light,
process follows. <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">It is a regular detective business,</q>
Mr. Webb added, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">and rather exciting sometimes, as
you may imagine.</q>
  <p>The insisting on bakers selling bread by weight
also gives some trouble; but the Act is, to a large
extent, a dead letter, as many people do not care to
have the odd bits which are put on as make-weights.
In this connection, Mr Webb remarked that it is a
curious and not generally known fact that the better
baked a loaf is the lighter it weighs. The dough is
always weighed before being made up into loaf form
and baked, but the baking evaporates the water in the
bread, so that the person who buys a crusty loaf has
less weight for his money. He has the same amount
of solid, but less water than the purchaser of the
lightly-baked loaf, and can claim to have a square
inch or two added on. This does not count as a trick
of the trade; but the effect of the Act has been to
make bakers allow for the evaporation of the water,
and the 4lb. loaf nowadays is nearer that weight than
ever it was before. Nor is this the only trade which




<pb n=250>







has benefited by the power of supervision granted
under recent Acts of Parliament. Before <datestruct value="1878--"><year>1878</year></datestruct> the
authorities had no power to inspect and test the
scales, weights, and graduated measures used by
chemists. When the Act was put into force it was no
uncommon thing to find grain weights stamped
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">2 gains,</q> and <foreign lang=la>vice versa</foreign>-a most alarming state of
things when it is remembered that they are used for
weighing subtle poisons. Of the graduated glasses in
use quite 50 per cent. were incorrect. This state of
things is now remedied. The testing of a graduated
glass is very tiring, as it has to be tested at each
mark, and if wrong at any one has to be thrown away.
Only about two out of every dozen sent in are passed
as correct, and a fee is chargeable only on those passed.
  <p>Before I left the place, Mr Webb drew my
attention to the instrument room. The offices are
well equipped with testing apparatus of all kinds,
and one could not but be struck with the niceity
with which these operations have to be carried out.
For instance, there is a balance which will turn
noticeably to the thousandth-part of a grain; and the
little aluminium weights are decidedly curious. This
balance is so sensitive that it takes 20 minutes to
adjust it every time it is used. There are many others
of different sizes up to huge scales to weigh the
heaviest possible weights. Very interesting is the
process of weighing fluids in bulk-used particularly
for weighing cans of milk-this being more certain
than by measure, weighing down to the last ounce of
fluid. Here, too, is seen a real <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">cwt.</q> As a matter
of fact, there is no <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">cwt.</q> used in this country, the
heaviest weight made here being half-a-cwt. These






<pb n=25l>



<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">cwts.</q> are made for use in the foreign corn trade,
and are tested before being sent out. The instruments
for testing measures of length are also interesting,
being of the greatest nicety. Yard and other measures
are tested in a certain temperature, owing to the
variation of length under different conditions of the
atmosphere.  It is done with the barometer at 30
inches and the temperature at 60 degrees. With ten
degrees of temperature you get a difference of a
hundredth part of an inch. In another department is
shown the testing and stamping of beer glasses and
mugs for publicans.  These come straight from the
makers, and from two to three thousand are tested
per day.  If they are not of the prescribed size, they
are rejected and are then useless.  Sometimes in a
case of 36 dozen not more than one dozen will pass
the test. Those passed are stamped by a sand-blast,
sand being impelled by bellows through a sort of
stencil plate, with sufficient force to bite through the
surface of the glass and leave an indelible mark. The
idea came from America, where during the great
demand for tombstones after the war, thousands were
engraved on this principle.

<HEAD>Up and Down the Thames.</HEAD>


  <p>The praises of the Thames have been sounded
through many ages, but there are no more quaint
criticisms extant than those in the books for
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">passengers' remarks</q> on the cabin table of the
four steamboats which ply daily between Salter's at Folly  Bridge  and  Kingston.
Sometimes the eulogy is a little unrestrained, and
rather curiously this is the  case  with those
who appear to have travelled most.   Here and
there the Thames is compared with the mighty
Mississippi, much to the disadvantage of the latter.
Other travellers lament that so many persons should
spend large sums of money to go to see the Rhine
when they have the Thames so near to hand; and
there is a large amount of common sense in some of
the remarks of this nature.  Then the comic man
puts in an appearance occasionally, and one is amused
to read such entries as <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">the doctor ordered me to the
Thames for change and rest; the steward took my
change, and the hotel proprietor took the rest.</q>  But
one searches the books in vain for any evidence that of
the thousands of passengers carried every season by
these boats any one was dissappointed with his
journey.
  <p>Salter's boats are now an institution.  For several
seasons they have run up and down the Thames
without cessation, doing the complete journey in two






<pb n=253>



days.  Every morning a boat starts from  Kingston
for Henley, and another from Oxford to Henley; and
every morning, too, boats leave the latter place for
Oxford and Kingston, so that there are four boats
constantly in use. But it is not necessary to complete
the journey within any specified time.  The fisherman may stay on the way at any favoured spot, and
try his fortune with the trout, pike, perch, roach, and
other fish, which are still to be found here.  The
geologist may linger to investigate the coralline oolite,
the calcareous grit, and the kimmeridge clay; or
stoppages may be made for rambles inland, passengers
joining or leaving the boats at any of the locks.
These locks are the natural stages of the boats, and
as there are 31 of them between London and Oxford
the opportunities to join or leave are sufficiently
numerous.
  <p>To the average voyager the charm of journeys up
and down the Thames lies in the scenery, and the
objects of interest-historic and otherwise-which are
to be seen.  These never allow the attention to flag.
By starting at Kingston one enters almost at once
upon the Thames of the poet and the painter. Below
Richmond Bridge the river is kept in constant touch
with the sea by the tide. Above Kingston one begins
to lose the town-like appearance of the villas, and
makes acquaintance with willowy eyots, and reedy
banks teeming with life, when the structure which
stands upon the site of Pope's Villa is reached. Then
comes Strawberry Hill, with its many literary associations, and, lying between Teddington and
Twickenham, Horace Walpole's villa, where he wrote
<title>The Castle of Otranto.</title> It has been aptly remarked

<pb n=254>







of this latter, that like all the literary works of Wal-
pole this ornamented edifice was constructed on the
same artificial principle; <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo"> an old paper lodging-
house converted by the magician of taste into a
Gothic castle full of scenic effects.</q> Here, too, are the
Twickenham meads about which Pope wrote so
eloquently. Thc captains are full of the legendry lore
of the places passed, and have plenty of interesting
information to give, not only of the places and houses
that can be seen, but of others hidden in umbrageous
depths. In a few moments one hears of Kitty Clive, Sir
Godfrey Kneller, Dean Swift, the poet Gay, Queens
Mary and Anne, Thomson, the poet, and many other
dead and gone worthies, not to forget Peg Woffington,
who sleeps in Teddington Church.
  <p>By this time the steamer is ploughing her way
among the river craft, of which there is an immense
variety, and the voyager has become initiated into
one feature of the journey-that of shutting off steam
when small craft are near, for fear of their being upset
by the waves caused by the action of the screw.  In
thc neighbourhood of Thames Ditton the captain
comes aft again to point out that imaginary relic of
antiquity, Coway Stakes, so-called because some years
ago some pointed stakes were taken out of the river
bed at this place, and were at once set down by
antiquarians as belonging to the Roman era.  The
antiquarians pointed in rapture to the fact that Caesar
himself recorded the fact that he fortified the Thames
by means of stakes, and these were the stakes.  So
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Coway Stakes</q> has become a river legend, and one
overlooks the curious irregular bridge which breaks
up the landscape not very attractively, to devote attention





<pb n=255>



to this interesting little story.  Near at hand
Walton Deeps excites the interest of anglers, while
others are interested in a spot associated with Admiral
Rodney and Lilley the astrologer.  On to Sunbury
Lock, and the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">race,</q> the Thames is seen running merrily
along at its swiftest pace: the tents of campers out are
gleaming among the trees, and a passing glimpse is
caught of Kempton Park.   The Surrey Hills have
become a feature in the landscape; and at Shepperton Lock there is a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">meeting of the waters,</q> the Wey
and the Bourne emptying into the Thames.  There
are some good opportunities for <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">snap-shots</q> by
amateur photographers, of whom there are always
some on board; a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">dark-room</q> being provided for
their especial use.  Chertsey Bridge, with its seven
arches having been left behind, Staines is soon
reached, and as the boat enters upon the waters of
the Upper Thames, some of the finest scenery is met
with.
  <p>Staines looks picturesque from the river, but is
largely hidden by trees. A glimpse is caught of the
red brick church associated with the name of Inigo
Jones, and everyone admires Rennie's granite bridge:
but the interest felt in Staines is overlooked in that
excited by Runnymede, the picturesquely situated
meadow in which King John signed the Magna
Charta, as certified in the document itself, preserved
in the British Museum.  Magna Charta Island is
duly pointed out by the captain, who repeats the
curious story told of how the Charter was saved from
destruction, by Sir Robert Cotton. Calling one day
at his tailor's, Sir Robert saw that the man was about
to cut up a piece of parchment. Being then engaged





<pb n=256>







in collecting the Cottonian MSS. he looked at the
parchment and was rejoiced to find that it was the
original Magna Charta, with all its seals and signatures; which had been mourned as lost.  Another
interesting little anecdote of the neighbourhood is
that under a gnarled old yew tree, near where once
stood a Benedictine Priory, King Henry wooed and
won Anne Boleyn. It was here, too, so the story
goes, that he waited for the signal by which he was
told of her death on Tower Hill. Reaching next that
antique inn the <name>Bells of Ouseley,</name> there is soon much
to see in connection with the Royal Borough of
Windsor, views of whose castle have already been
caught among the trees.
  <p>After a stay of an hour for lunch, the journey is
resumed. At Bray, the church of the accommodating
Vicar who lives still in song is observed on the left,
and the interest on each bank is well maintained to
Maidenhead. The densely wooded hills are a pleasing
feature; and Clieveden, the late residence of the Duke
of Westminster, cannot be overlooked. It stands
upon the site of the original house described by the
poet as <quote>Cliefden's proud alcove; the bower of
Warton, Shrewsbury, and love.</quote> The poem is all that
remains to tell the story of how the Duke of Buckingham, favourite of the second Charles, killed Lord
Shrewsbury in a duel, the latter's wife, disguised as a
page, holding her paramour's horse the while. The
present house is a modern structure, and stands most
picturesquely on the top of the thickly wooded slopes.
From here to Cookham the river banks are varied
and beautiful, and next comes Marlow, and the splendid view of Bisham Abbey and Church; to be followed






<pb n=257>



shortly by Medmenham Abbey; and Hurley
with its delightful combination of woods, gardens, and
quaintly built houses-above all, the little-that remains of Lady Place, once the mansion of the
Lovelaces. By this time the first day's journey is nearly
over, but, however, satiated with the variety of the
scenery that has been enjoyed, interest quickens
once more as Henley is approached, and the unrivalled
long straight reach to the bridge is entered upon after
passing Greenlands, which was for so long the
delightful residence of the late Mr. W. H. Smith.
  <p>The second day's journey is not a whit less attractive than the first, though the interest lies more in the
variety of the scenery than in local associations, and
historic connections. The view around Marsh Lock
is as pleasing as anything on the river; its long zigzag
bridge looking very quaint and eminently rustic.
Shiplake, too, has many attractive features; not the
least among which is the ivy clad church in which the
poet Tennyson was married. Then there is the mill
at Sonning, near which Sydney Smith lived while he
wrote the Peter Plymley letters; and the boat passes
a curious group of islands, to embrace which the river
spreads out to double its ordinary width, Reading is
seen first in the distance, and then near at hand,
Caversham Heights are in the distance; and readers
of Mary Mitford's <title>Recollections of a Literary Life</title>
will recall her unstinted praise of the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">flowery banks</q>
at Caversham Warren, though they have been much
despoiled of late years by the speculative builder.
Here, too, is Caversham Bridge, which replaced the
one on which Prince Rupert made a gallant fight.
The journey up stream lies between pleasantly





<pb n=258>


wooded banks, and the observant voyager may hope
to see the kingfisher playing about the banks, and
many species of wild birds that still haunt the river.
At Mapledurham a fine old wooden mill is seen; but
one has largely to take for granted the grand old
Elizabethan House, with its secret rooms which were
so largely used by the Royalists in the Civil War, for
the concealment of fugitives. Not much is to be seen
of it from the river, except from just below the lock,
when through the trees a passing view is caught of its
gables and decorated chimneys. A little further on is
Hardwick House, associated with the name of the ill-
fated Charles I., and others of the Stately Homes of
England attract attention in and around Pangbourne,
where the up-river scenery is seen at its best. At
Wallingford the usual stay is made for lunch; and
the interesting old town amply repays a visit. The
remainder of the journey is eminently pleasing, lying
through  Clifton  Hampden, Culham, Abingdon,
Nuneham, with its beautiful woods, and Iffley to
Oxford. There are more of green meadows here
than of the umbrageous heights of the earlier part of
the journey; but the scene throughout is eminently
pleasing, and in conclusion, it need only be added
that the voyager is sure to be delighted, whether his
journey is up or down the river.

<HEAD>Captain Shaw at Home.</HEAD>



  <p>Captain Shaw used to be <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">At Home</q> at the
Metropolitan Fire Brigade Headquarters every
Wednesday between the hours of two and four; and
it is needless to say that these gatherings were
exceedingly popular. In the matter of entertaining
his visitors, Captain Shaw had unique advantages.
With the resources of the Brigade at his disposal, and
a large body of trained men always on duty, he was
able to afford an insight into to the capabilities of the
firemen, which was exceedingly interesting, and not a
little instructive. Here, in the quiet of the courtyard
the evolutions and methods of saving life and property
are seen to manifest advantage; and one is able to
comprehend how splendidly the force has been
organised. There is, of course, more spectacular
effect when the members are seen at work on some
big conflagration. The blaze and smoke, rush and
roar, and the general excitement which always
prevails on these occasions give a realistic-sometimes a tragic-effect to the operations which cannot
be simulated in the drill-yard. But there are also
abundant disadvantages from the merely sight-seeing
point of view, and he who wants to get a comprehensive idea ot the methods and general working
arrangements of the Brigade would do better to see
them <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">at home.</q>





<pb n=260>







  <p>The Headquarters building is not in any sense an
imposing looking structure, and viewed casually by
the pedestrian passing along the Southwark Bridge
Road there is little to indicate the near presence of the
busy force which night and day, without relaxation, is
keenly on the alert. Through the glazed doors a
passing glimpse is caught of manuals and fire engines,
but everything looks quiet and practically deserted.
Ring the alarm bell, and immediately all is bustle and
activity. From the office, living rooms, stables, and
recreation rooms men are rushing into the large hall
where the engines are kept in readiness. Each man
has an assigned duty, and does it without a word.
Some rush in with the horses ready-harnessed from
the stables; others are waiting to fasten them in;
while some have donned helmets and buckled on
axes; and in an incredibly short space of time a
steam fire-engine and a manual have galloped out at
the doors.
  <p>As this happens many times a day-last year the
Brigade responded to upwards of three thousand calls
-this may be the first thing the visitor sees on his or
her arrival. It is over in a moment, and all is as quite
as before; though still further relays of men, horses,
and engines are ready to follow suit should the
emergency arise. In the office to the right, which is
first entered, are seen quite an appalling array of
telephones and alarms-communications with various
works, all the police stations, and fire stations, and
also-to which the special attention of the visitor is
drawn-the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">other end</q> of the fire alarm posts which
are to be seen in many places in the metropolis. The
working of these latter is exceedingly simple. It





<pb n=261>



is but a matter of breaking a small pane of glass
and pulling a knob, and in the office a bell rings and
a flap falls down showing the the street or place at
which the alarm has been given. An official in the
office promptly starts another alarm, which rings in
every part of the building, and, as already seen, a
manual and fire-engine are promptly started. These,
on reaching the place, immediately signal back from
the alarm post, according to a code of signals,
informing the officials whether it is a false alarm, or a
serious fire, and what further assistance may be
required.
  <p>The drilling takes place in the yard; which seems
perfectly hedged in with fire escapes of various
patterns, some ready for use and some held in
reserve. Every care appears to be taken to provide
for emergencies. Should a fire-escape be damaged
at any of the stations, here are others ready mounted
on carts which can be trundled off at a moment's
notice. Or should one of the street perambulatory
stations be run into, there are reserve stations fully
equipped ready to take its place. A corps of a dozen
men trundle in a fire-escape, and having run with it
round the yard, rear it up against the wall, high
enough to scale the roof. Then the mimic work of
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">saving</q> life commences. One after another, with
the nimbleness of sailors-as in fact they all have
been-they mount the roof. Those who are told off
to be <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">saved</q> immediately fall down and lie inert.
One of the others goes to him, and it is interesting to
see how easily, without aid, he can get a prostrate
and helpless individual on his shoulders. Turning
him on his face, he first straightens the limbs, then






<pb n=262>







raises him by the shoulders on to the knees, and
putting his own shoulders to the breast of the
supposed senseless person, lifts him  up.  The
individual-whether man or woman-is then bent
double and face downwards over the fireman's back,
head hanging down one side and feet the other. One
arm is passed under the fireman's arm; and in the
case of a man the fireman places his left arm between
the legs, and holds on to the man's left leg. In the
case of a woman the only difference is that he places
the arm round both legs, and thus held the movements of the fireman are not impeded; and there is
no danger of the individual falling off. Carrying his
burden easily, the fireman descends the lad er to
where the shoot begins. Here he deftly slides his
burden into the shoot. In the case of a woman he
puts her in head first, so that her dress may not
catch; and in case of a man he puts him in feet first.
Without losing hold in either case, he follows himself
headfirst in the shoot, and still holding the saved
person, regulates their joint descent by means of his
elbows and knees. One after the other men are
brought down, without any hitch occurring, and to
give a touch of realism one of the firemen has a long
dress on to represent a woman. It looks a risky
proceeding. The roof is so high, the telescope ladders
which form the top part of the escape seem so shaky;
and the firemen are so burdened with the inanimate
mass of humanity hanging limp and helpless across
their shoulders, that it seems almost incredable
accidents should never happen. Yet as a matter of
fact that is 'so. None but seamen being admitted
into the brigade, they are all accustomed to scale dizzy






<pb n=263>



heights, and to make ascents and descents under
conditions of danger such as might appal the
unaccustomed landsman. It is satisfactory to know
that no slip or stumble has ever occurred which has
resulted in personal injury. With the jumping sheet
which subsequently comes under notice-and the use
of which is well understood-there have been cases of
injury through the jumpers not dropping into the
centre of the sheet; but these have not been of a
serious character.
  <p>Passing from the fire-escapes, the fire-engines next
claim attention, and again the visitor is surprised by
the celerity with which they are sent out and got into
working order. The engine despatched in answer to
the first call is a small one. If necessary the larger
ones quickly follow, and about 40 seconds suffices to
man them, start the boiler, and start them on their
mission. It is done in the same systematic way.
Every man knows his part of the work and does it
The horses, too, seem equally alive to their duty. In
turn they are kept ready harnessed, but in order
that they may not be tired by the weight of the
harness, it is supported in such a way that not
an ounce of the weight is felt by the horse. The
signal rings in the stable, where man and horses
are ready; one man to each horse. , The man
seizes the bridle, and the horse, hardly requiring
any touch, starts forward.   By this movement
the cords holding the harness are disconnected; the
harness falls into its place, and the horse is
free to run to the engine, where ready hands
quickly attach the traces; and others buckle the
animal in front; a third pair hand the reins






<pb n=264>







to the driver, who has mounted his seat, and
the start is made as the other men jump each
to his assigned place. With a loud rattle it dashes
through the doors and is quickly out of sight.
In returning they also come back at a gallop, and
the way they dash round sharp corners is enough
to' make one tremble. But the drivers are of the
best, and the horses know their work and seem to
delight in it. The unharnessing is done just as
quickly as the harnessing; and each horse has his
hoofs examined to see that the shoes have not started.
So accustomed are they to this-and it is a curious
instance of the effect of habit on animals-that some
of them lift their feet one after the other, displaying
their hoofs without any suggestion from the men. It
sounds something like the old Yankee story of the
hens of a roving owner, which got so accustomed to
being moved, that when they saw a furniture van
enter the yard they turned on their backs and held up
their legs to be tied. But it is a fact, nevertheless,
and is to be noticed at every <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">At Home.</q>
  <p>There is much interest, too, in the glimpse of the
daily life of the firemen. It is laborious work, and
great demands are necessarily made upon them ; but
they respond cheerfully, and at head-quarters they are
quite a happy family. Every one lives on the premises
-the single men on the dormitory system, and the
married men having quarters arranged similarly to
those in military barracks. Reading-rooms and recreation rooms are provided: and there is a library
a gymnasium, and an instruction-room, so that they
can spend theirleisure pleasantly and profitably. There
is also a department which is of special interest to the



<pb n=265>



visitor.  This is the museum  where relics are preserved of firemen who meet with death in their
hazardous calling. Here the battered helmet he wore,
his uniform, and other things are exhibited, with his
name and the circumstances of his death set forth. It
may seem to some, perhaps, a rather lugubrious
display; but the men appreciate the fact that they
will not be forgotten if they meet with disaster at the
call of duty.

<HEAD>City News of a Century Ago; The Lord Mayor's State Bed.</HEAD>
  <p>Four old newspapers have come into the custody of
Mr. Welch, the chief librarian at the Guildhall, which
contain some curious items of City intelligence. The
oldest is a copy of the <title>Daily Gazetteer</title> for <datestruct value="1735-10-13">
<day type=name>Thursday</day>, <month>October</month> <day type=number>23</day>, <year>1735</year></datestruct>, and the others are the
<title>General Evening Post</title> for <datestruct value="1787-05-19"><day type=name>Saturday</day>, <month>May</month> <day type=number>19</day>, <year>1787</year></datestruct>;
<title>Lloyd's Evening Post</title> for <datestruct value="1770-01-03"><month>January</month> <day type=number>3</day>, <year>1770</year></datestruct>;
and the <title>Courier</title> for <datestruct value="1824-12-07"><month>December</month> <day type=number>7</day>, <year>1824</year></datestruct>. They have evidently been
kept because of their references to City affairs, and
they are now being carefully preserved at the Guildhall Library for that reason, as otherwise they contain
no intelligence of moment.
  <p>One of the most curious items of news is that in
the <title>Courier</title> which relates to that old civic institution,
the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">City State Bed,</q> which was for many generations
of Lord Mayors one of the features of the Mansion
House, but which, like the Lord Mayor's fool-whose
chief duty was to leap, clothes and all, into a large
bowl of custard at the inauguration dinner-has long
ceased to exist. The end of the State bed is set
forth in an amusing article. It appears to have been
of Brobdingnagian proportions, for it is likened in
size to the historic bed at Ware, in which twenty-six
butchers and their wives slept on the night of the
Coronation of William III. Many chief magistrates
had slept upon its ample proportions since the days










<pb n=267>



of Alderman Haines, when it was brand new and very
gorgeous, having cost no less a sum than &pound;3,000.
Sir W. Curtis, Sir C. Flower, and <quote>other magistrates
of similar eating and sleeping capacity</quote> had in turn
<quote>filled it,</quote> we are told; but of late it had been
disused; and <quote>the Alderman and his lady, who
possess at present the privilege of sleeping in the
great Pulvinar, proposed that it should be put up to
auction, and a snug, comfortable, ordinary, clean bed
substituted.</quote>  Some members of the Corporation.
however, <quote>looking forward to the honours of the
largest bed in the City</quote> objected, and accordingly
the question was <quote>discussed in the councils of the
City with all the good sense and wisdom which ever
distinguished their debates.</quote>  The case was first
agitated in a <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Committee of General Purpose,</q> which
met in the bedroom with the bed itself in evidence,
and, being of a frugal turn of mind, arrived at the conclusion that it might be <quote>cleansed, fumigated,
re-dyed, and repaired; the curtains could be neatly
patched with the window curtains, and new window
curtains bought, with the very moderate sum of
&pound;800.</quote> But the Lord Mayor still objected; so the
Court of Common Council sat in deep deliberation on
the matter, when <quote>some more light having been
thrown on the state of the bed; and it being im-
possible to remove all the tenants who possess its
honours without being elected by the citizens, it was
finally decided to expel it and them altogether from
the Mansion House.</quote> So the State bed passed away,
never to be replaced.
  <p>Another old time civic institution was the Lord
Mayor's Band. There is a curious bit of news about






<pb n=268>







it in the <title>General Evening Post</title>, which records, among
the legal proceedings, that on the previous Saturday
a case came on at the Guildhall-evidently the Civil
and not the Criminal Court-which caused no small
amount of amusement to the court and jury. It
appears to have been usual for the members of the
band, in attendance on State occasions, to have
dinner provided for them by two o'clock. On Easter
Monday their dinner consisted <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">only</q> of fish, roast
beef, hams, fillets of veal, puddings, pies, and custards,
but no fowls or chickens. <quote>This omission,</quote> we read,
<quote>so exasperated the scrapers of catgut and the
thrummers on wire, that they resolved on knowing the
reason, in full band headed by the first fiddle, why
they were served with so shabby a dinner.</quote> Accordingly they went to Mr. Birch,
<quote>who was the gentlemen who regulated the dinners of the day, and loaded
him with the most harsh and discordant epithets,
which obliged hin to push the person who played
the bass viol out of the room in the true <foreign lang=it>spirituoso</foreign>
style, for which treatment this disciple of the immortal
Handel brought this action, assisted by the whole
band, and laid his damages to the tune of &pound;200; nor
would he change his notes, though from the beginning
overture was made by the defendant for the purpose,
till the jury withdrew and brought in their verdict for
the plaintiff with one penny damages.</quote> Apparently
the band subsequently got too autocratic, and passed
out of existence like the State bed, the Lord Mayor's
fool, and the State barges.
  <p>In the news columns we get a reference to
Fauntleroy, the banker, who had then but recently
been hanged for forgery; and a remonstrance from











<pb n=269>



the Lord Mayor to Lord Barrington, Secretary of
War, some soldiers from Spitalfields having passed
through the City <quote>with drums beating and fifes playing; making a warlike appearance,</quote> without leave
asked and obtained. Lord Barrington, in his reply,
admitted the justice of the complaint, and would
<quote>take care that the officer in command should
know his opinion.</quote> Then there is the announcement
of the discovery, <quote>a few days since, of some fragments, very curious, of a Roman tessilated pavement,
by some workmen who were digging a foundation on
the site of the old Navy Office in Crutched Friars; by
some antiquarians considered to have laid there seventeen hundred years.</quote> From an item on another page
it appears that the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">burgling fraternity</q> was very
artful, even so long ago, and practised tricks which
still obtain among it to this day; for we read that
<quote>On Monday evening a tradesman and his wife in
White's Row, Whitechapel, went out to spend an
evening with some friends, leaving a servant at home.
A man knocked at the door, and telling her that her
master and mistress had sent for her, she immediately
went. They, alarmed at her unexpected arrival, returned home, to find that the house had been rifled,
&pound;30 in cash taken, and &pound;20 worth of booty taken off.</quote>
  <p>One bit of Society gossip there is which shows that
newspapers from their earliest days had a keen scent
for scandal. The following is given as <quote>the true
origin of the acquaintance between Lord and Lady
G----.</quote> <quote>Lord G. had, by the irregularity of his
bachelor life, brought his health into a critical state;
and his physician recommended matrimony to him
as the most certain method of living regularly. He






<pb n=270>
accordingly formed the resolution of offering his hand
to the first woman he could fancy. Being one day in
Spring in Kensington Gardens, and a heavyshower falling, he was obliged to take shelter in the same covered
seat with two ladies, one of whom was Miss V. A conversation ensued, in which he asked the ladies if they
had a carriage; and they said they had not. He
entreated them to take part of his to convey them to
town, and after a little entreaty they consented. On
their way Miss V. said she thought it was the easiest
carriage she had ever been in, whereupon his lordship
boldly replied that she might be mistress of it whenever she pleased. Miss V. blushed, and thanked him;
and they were married within a month from that
day.</quote>
  <p>There is also a paragraph announcing the decision
of the Common Council <quote>to light the city from the
setting of the sun to its rising every night throughout
the year</quote>-an important event to which due
prominence is given-and a mass of other information which will repay the attention of those interested
in the history of the City and its institutions.

<HEAD>Curious Powers of City Companies.<note type=foot n=1>This article appeared in the <title>St. James' Gazette</title>
  of <datestruct value="1896-10-01"><month>October</month> <day type=number>1st,</day> <year>1896</year></datestruct>.</HEAD>
  <p>The action of the tailors who took part in the
recent strike, in calling upon the Merchant Taylors'
Company to put into force the powers they possess
under their charters, called attention to the fact that
almost all the Companies-there being less than half
a dozen exceptions-possess, or did possess, powers
of interference over those engaged in the trades they
represent. Some of these powers are very curious.
  <p>It will be remembered that not very long ago there
was a revival of the powers of one of the Companies
to deal with unruly apprentices; and many were
startled to find that at the, Bridewell there is still a
special place of punishment reserved for the City
apprentice.  Several of the Companies had special
powers over apprentices, including the Goldsmiths'
Company (which had the right to flog apprentices),
the Armourers' Company, and the Founders' Company.
  <p>The principal powers of the City Companies are as
regards false measures, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">deceiptful goods,</q> trickeries
of trade in general, as well as unskilful manufacture.
In the early days they regulated the trade, and did
the work that is now done by the Inspectors of the
London County Council.   But their powers went
further than that.  The Apothecaries' Company







<pb n=272>







possessed the power of entering any apothecary's
shop and testing his medicines, to see that they were
of good quality.   The   Grocers' Company had
power of search, and no grocer could sell any wares
that had not been <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">garbelled</q> and approved. If he
attempted to do so the goods were forfeited.  Their
chief powers were directed against adulteration and
the assaying of weights. One in particular was against
the adulteration of sugar by adding starch. Groceries,
too, were prohibited from being sold in the street-
except <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">figges.</q>  The attention of the Skinners'
Company was specially directed against the <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">faking</q>
of furs-the selling of old furs for new; and, like the
other Companies, it had powers of search, which, as
far as can be ascertained, came to an end with the
closing of St. Bartholomew's Fair.  The Wheelwrights' Company had power to regulate- the size of
all wheels used on vehicles in the streets.
  <p>As far back as the reign of Edward III. every
youth had to choose before Candlemas the trade or
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">mistery</q> he intended to follow, and he had henceforth to stick to it, and could not change. -In almost
all the cases an important power possessed by the
Companies was that they could prohibit any person
from setting up in business unless he was a member
of the Company, and satisfied the authorities that he
was a skilful craftsman.  In one case, that of the
Mercers' Company, he also had to show that he was
possessed of a sum of &pound;100. This is the only case in
which the monetary qualification entered into consideration.  The same company had special powers
to punish the selling of the secrets of their <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">misterv</q>
to outsiders; and the wardens of that company are


<pb n=273>



enjoined to search the premises of every mercer
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">twice every year, or as often as it pleased them.</q>
An apprentice to this trade had first to be approved
by the wardens, and he was bound for ten years,
taking at the time of signing his indentures an oath of
allegiance to the throne.
  <p>A curious feature in regard to the Companies in the
olden days was that they used to provide a stock of
wheat against periods of dearth and scarcity.  Previously to this duty devolving upon them the Lord
Mayor had to provide it, sometimes out of his own
purse, and sometimes at the expense of the City funds.
But the Lord Mayor shifted it on to the Companies,
and they used to store their wheat at the Bridge
House on old London Bridge, where each Company
had a separate granary.  When the bridge was rebuilt they provided granaries either at their halls or
elsewhere, and the total value of wheat held in stock
against possible famine was never less than &pound;1,000.
  <p>Amongst the powers still exercised, in addition to
the Goldsmith's Company already mentioned, is the
right of members of the Vintners' Company to sell
foreign wine and spirits without a licence. There were
still many <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">free vintners</q> throughout the country,
who do not come under the jurisdiction of the licensing
authorities. From time immemorial this Company also
enjoyed the exclusive right of <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">loading and landing,
pitching and turning</q>  wines and spirits imported to
and exported from the City of London. Its franchise
is still exercised by its tackle-porters.  The Gunmakers, too, have kept their right to test and approve
guns at their proof-house.  They formerly had the
right to punish any man who made a gun without




<pb n=274>




having been apprenticed to the trade, and to prevent
persons hawking guns for sale. Another Company
exercisingg important powers is the Scriveners', which
prevents any man practicing as a notary in the City
unless he is a member of the Company and duly
qualified.  The Fishmongers' Company has always
had the control of the fish trade, and a reminder to
this effect came in the form of a notice recently issued,
addressed to <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">fishermen, fishmongers, dealers in fish,
and others,</q> warning them against the capture of unseasonable and unclean salmon, and of migratory
fish of the genus salmon, and its sale, either in London or
the provinces.   They do not, however, as in olden
times, impose fines <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">of their own right,</q> but initiate
prosecutions before the legal tribunals.  Their functions in the matter of the seizure of unsound fish are
also largely undertaken now by the inspectors and
officers of local authorities.
  <p>One of the latest powers exercised was by the
Butchers' Company, which, in the reign of George
III., got an Act passed which was known as the
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">Flaying Act,</q> by which, in concert with the Cordwainers and Curriers they had power to levy fines on
persons <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">wilfully, negligently, or carelessly</q> gashing
the skins of animals when flaying them.  This Act
was repealed in <datestruct value="1824--"><year>1824</year></datestruct>.  Before the Commission of
Sewers took over the duty, this Company used to
search for and seize bad meat; but they found a diffi-
culty in recovering their costs.  Still more curious
powers of this Company were those for preventing
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">forestalling, discommending other men's meat,</q> and
<q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">conspiring not to sell meat except at a certain price.</q>
They had further the power to tax butchers for the


<pb n=275>



removal of the general offal.  The Cordwainers
regulated the sale of boots and shoes up to the time
of George IV., when the power ceased to be exer-
cised, <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">by the will of Parliament.</q>
  <p>It does not appear that the Drapers' Company had
any statutory authority to interfere with the trade;
but they had an exclusive monopoly for the sale of
cloth, and had a special market for its sale.  No one
was allowed to sell or buy cloth that had not first
been through the Company's hall.
  <p>Most of the powers of search, as has been stated,
came to an end with St. Bartholomew's Fair; but the
other powers of interference and supervision with
trade continued to a later period.  In most cases
they fell into desuetude owing to the changed condition of trade. But in some cases the Company's right
was contested. This was so with the Broderers, who,
when in <datestruct value="1710--"><year>1710</year></datestruct> they attempted to exercise their powers
-the trade having ignored them-found they could
not do so. They had made a general search, and fined
a number of people who <q rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">were refractory and used
scurrilous language to the wardens;</q> but it was
resisted, and, on the advice of Serjeant Dee, whom
they consulted, they abandoned their right.  The
Framework Knitters' Company had an action brought
against them for vexatious interference, which they
lost, and it destroyed their trade influence in that
respect. The Tallow Chandlers' Company had to
pay damages in a case in which their interference was
resented. Other Company's powers fell into desuetude
for purely trade reasons.  The Girdlers' Company,
before girdles went out of fashion, found it impossible
to prevent foreign competition, and could not exercise






<pb n=276>







its rights because the trade had outgrown its original
limits.  The Glaziers were unable to keep the trade
to themselves; in course of time it came to pass that
any one could call himself a glazier.
  <p>In conclusion, it is only necessary to emphasize-
what has already been indicated-that most of these
powers are obsolete, and are admitted to be so by the
Companies themselves.  There are, however, exceptions to this rule.  The Farriers and the Gold and
Silver Wyre Drawers claim not to have abandoned
any of their rights.
